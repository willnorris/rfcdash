Abstract

   A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) has access to not only the
   information disseminated by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol
   (IGP) but also the set of active paths and their reserved resources
   for its computation.  The additional Label Switched Path (LSP) state
   information allows the PCE to compute constrained paths while
   considering individual LSPs and their interactions.  This requires a
   State Synchronization mechanism between the PCE and the network, the
   PCE and Path Computation Clients (PCCs), and cooperating PCEs.  The
   basic mechanism for State Synchronization is part of the stateful PCE
   specification.  This document presents motivations for optimizations
   to the base State Synchronization procedure and specifies the
   required Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
   extensions.

   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Client (PCC) requests.

   [<a id="ref-RFC8231" name="ref-RFC8231">RFC8231</a>] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to provide stateful
   control.  A stateful PCE has access to not only the information
   carried by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) but also the
   set of active paths and their reserved resources for its
   computations.  The additional state allows the PCE to compute
   constrained paths while considering individual LSPs and their
   interactions.  This requires a State Synchronization mechanism
   between the PCE and the network, the PCE and the PCC, and cooperating
   PCEs.  [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>] describes the basic mechanism for State
   Synchronization.  This document specifies following optimizations for
   State Synchronization and the corresponding PCEP procedures and
   extensions:

   o  State Synchronization Avoidance: To skip State Synchronization if
      the state has survived and not changed during session restart.
      (See <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.)

   o  Incremental State Synchronization: To do incremental (delta) State
      Synchronization when possible.  (See <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.)

   o  PCE-Triggered Initial Synchronization: To let PCE control the
      timing of the initial State Synchronization.  (See <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.)

   o  PCE-Triggered Resynchronization: To let PCE resynchronize the
      state for sanity check.  (See <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.)

   Support for each of the synchronization optimization capabilities is
   advertised during the PCEP initialization phase.  See <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> for
   the new flags defined in this document.  The handling of each flag is
   described in the relevant section.

   PCE, and PCEP Peer.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [<a href="rfc8051.html" title='"Applicability of a Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE)"'>RFC8051</a>]: Stateful
   PCE, Delegation, and LSP State Database (LSP-DB).

   This document uses the following terms defined in [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>]:
   Redelegation Timeout Interval, LSP State Report, and LSP Update

   Within this document, when describing PCE-PCE communications, the
   requesting PCE fills the role of a PCC as usual.

   The purpose of State Synchronization is to provide a
   checkpoint-in-time state replica of a PCC's LSP state in a stateful
   PCE.  State Synchronization is performed immediately after the
   initialization phase [<a href="rfc5440.html" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>].  [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>] describes the basic
   mechanism for State Synchronization.

   State Synchronization is not always necessary following a PCEP
   session restart.  If the state of both PCEP peers did not change, the
   synchronization phase may be skipped.  This can result in significant
   savings in both control-plane data exchanges and the time it takes
   for the stateful PCE to become fully operational.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20State%20Synchronization%20Avoidance%20Procedure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  State Synchronization Avoidance Procedure</span>

   State Synchronization MAY be skipped following a PCEP session restart
   if the state of both PCEP peers did not change during the period
   prior to session re-initialization.  To be able to make this
   determination, state must be exchanged and maintained by both PCE and
   PCC during normal operation.  This is accomplished by keeping track
   of the changes to the LSP-DB, using a version tracking field called
   the LSP-DB Version Number.

   The INCLUDE-DB-VERSION (S) bit in the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV
   (<a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>) is advertised on a PCEP session during session startup to
   indicate that the LSP-DB Version Number is to be included when the
   LSPs are reported to the PCE.  The LSP-DB Version Number, carried in
   LSP-DB-VERSION TLV (see <a href="#section-3.3.1">Section 3.3.1</a>), is owned by a PCC, and it
   MUST be incremented by 1 for each successive change in the PCC's LSP-
   DB.  The LSP-DB Version Number MUST start at 1 and may wrap around.

   Values 0 and 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF are reserved.  If either of the two
   values are used during LSP State (re)Synchronization, the PCE speaker
   receiving this value MUST send back a PCEP Error (PCErr) with Error-
   type=20 and Error-value=6 'Received an invalid LSP-DB Version
   Number', and close the PCEP session.  Operations that trigger a
   change to the local LSP-DB include a change in the LSP operational
   state, delegation of an LSP, removal or setup of an LSP, or change in
   any of the LSP attributes that would trigger a report to the PCE.

   If the include LSP-DB version capability is enabled, a PCC MUST
   increment its LSP-DB Version Number when the 'Redelegation Timeout
   Interval' timer expires (see [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>] for the use of the
   Redelegation Timeout Interval).

   If both PCEP speakers set the S flag in the OPEN object's
   STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV to 1, the PCC MUST include the LSP-DB-
   VERSION TLV in each LSP object of the Path Computation LSP State
   Report (PCRpt) message.  If the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV is missing in a
   PCRpt message, the PCE will generate an error with Error-type=6
   (Mandatory Object missing) and Error-value=12 'LSP-DB-VERSION TLV
   missing', and close the session.  If the include LSP-DB version
   capability has not been enabled on a PCEP session, the PCC SHOULD NOT
   include the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in the LSP Object, and the PCE MUST
   ignore it, were it to receive one.

   If a PCE's LSP-DB survived the restart of a PCEP session, the PCE
   will include the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in its OPEN object, and the TLV
   will contain the last LSP-DB Version Number received on an LSP State
   Report from the PCC in the previous PCEP session.  If a PCC's LSP-DB
   survived the restart of a PCEP session, the PCC will include the LSP-
   DB-VERSION TLV in its OPEN object, and the TLV will contain the
   latest LSP-DB Version Number.  If a PCEP speaker's LSP-DB did not
   survive the restart of a PCEP session or at startup when the database
   is empty, the PCEP speaker MUST NOT include the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in
   the OPEN object.

   If both PCEP speakers include the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in the OPEN
   object and the TLV values match, the PCC MAY skip State
   Synchronization, and the PCE does not wait for the end-of-
   synchronization marker [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>].  Otherwise, the PCC MUST perform
   full State Synchronization (see [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>]) or incremental State
   Synchronization (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> if this capability is advertised) to
   the stateful PCE.  In other words, if the incremental State
   Synchronization capability is not advertised by the peers, based on
   the LSP-DB Version Number match, either the State Synchronization is
   skipped or a full State Synchronization is performed.  If the PCC
   attempts to skip State Synchronization, by setting the SYNC flag to 0
   and PLSP-ID to a non-zero value on the first LSP State Report from

   the PCC as per [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>], the PCE MUST send back a PCErr with Error-
   type=20 and Error-value=2 'LSP-DB version mismatch', and close the
   PCEP session.

   If State Synchronization is required, then prior to completing the
   initialization phase, the PCE MUST mark any LSPs in the LSP-DB that
   were previously reported by the PCC as stale.  When the PCC reports
   an LSP during State Synchronization, if the LSP already exists in the
   LSP-DB, the PCE MUST update the LSP-DB and clear the stale marker
   from the LSP.  When it has finished State Synchronization, the PCC
   MUST immediately send an end-of-synchronization marker.  The end-of-
   synchronization marker is a PCRpt message with an LSP object
   containing a PLSP-ID of 0 and with the SYNC flag set to 0 [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>].
   The LSP-DB-VERSION TLV MUST be included in this PCRpt message.  On
   receiving this state report, the PCE MUST purge any LSPs from the
   LSP-DB that are still marked as stale.

   Note that a PCE/PCC MAY force State Synchronization by not including
   the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in its OPEN object.

   Since a PCE does not make changes to the LSP-DB Version Number, a PCC
   should never encounter this TLV in a message from the PCE (other than
   the OPEN message).  A PCC SHOULD ignore the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV, were
   it to receive one from a PCE.

   Figure 1 shows an example sequence where the State Synchronization is
   skipped.

   Figure 3 shows an example sequence where the State Synchronization is
   skipped, but because one or both PCEP speakers set the S flag to 0,
   the PCC does not send LSP-DB-VERSION TLVs in subsequent PCRpt
   messages to the PCE.  If the current PCEP session restarts, the PCEP
   speakers will have to perform State Synchronization, since the PCE
   does not know the PCC's latest LSP-DB Version Number information.

   There could be a case during PCEP session re-establishment when the
   PCC's or PCE's IP address can change.  This includes, but is not
   limited to, the following cases:

   o  A PCC could use a physical interface IP address to connect to the
      PCE.  In this case, if the line card that the PCC connects from
      changes, then the PCEP session goes down and comes back up again,
      with a different IP address associated with a new line card.

   o  The PCC or PCE may move in the network, either physically or
      logically, which may cause its IP address to change.  For example,
      the PCE may be deployed as a virtual network function (VNF), and
      another virtualized instance of the PCE may be populated with the
      original PCE instance's state, but it may be given a different IP
      address.

   To ensure that a PCEP peer can recognize a previously connected peer,
   each PCEP peer includes the SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID TLV described in
   <a href="#section-3.3.2">Section 3.3.2</a> in the OPEN message.

   This TLV is used during the State Synchronization procedure to
   identify the PCEP session as a re-establishment of a previous session
   that went down.  Then State Synchronization optimizations such as
   state sync avoidance can be applied to this session.  Note that this
   usage is only applicable within the State Timeout Interval [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>].
   After the State Timeout Interval expires, all state associated with
   the PCEP session is removed, which includes the SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID
   received.  Note that the PCEP session initialization [<a href="rfc5440.html" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP)"'>RFC5440</a>]
   procedure remains unchanged.

   The LSP-DB Version Number (LSP-DB-VERSION) TLV is an optional TLV
   that MAY be included in the OPEN object and the LSP object.

   This TLV is included in the LSP object in the PCRpt message to
   indicate the LSP-DB version at the PCC.  This TLV SHOULD NOT be
   included in other PCEP messages (Path Computation Update Request
   (PCUpd), Path Computation Request (PCReq), and Path Computation Reply
   (PCRep)) and MUST be ignored if received.

   The format of the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV is shown in the following

   The Speaker Entity Identifier TLV (SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID) is an optional
   TLV that MAY be included in the OPEN object when a PCEP speaker
   wishes to determine if State Synchronization can be skipped when a
   PCEP session is restarted.  It contains a unique identifier for the
   node that does not change during the lifetime of the PCEP speaker.
   It identifies the PCEP speaker to its peers even if the speaker's IP
   address is changed.

   In case of a remote peer IP address change, a PCEP speaker would
   learn the Speaker Entity Identifier on receiving the open message,
   but it MAY have already sent its open message without realizing that
   it is a known PCEP peer.  In such a case, either a full
   synchronization is done or the PCEP session is terminated.  This may
   be a local policy decision.  The new IP address is associated with
   the Speaker Entity Identifier for the future either way.  In the
   latter case when the PCEP session is re-established, it would be
   correctly associated with the Speaker Entity Identifier and not be
   considered as an unknown peer.

   The format of the SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID TLV is shown in the following
   figure:

   The type of the TLV is 24, and it has a variable length, which MUST
   be greater than 0.  The value is padded to a 4-octet alignment.  The
   padding is not included in the Length field.  The value contains the
   Speaker Entity Identifier (an identifier of the PCEP speaker
   transmitting this TLV).  This identifier is required to be unique
   within its scope of visibility, which is usually limited to a single
   domain.  It MAY be configured by the operator.  Alternatively, it can
   be derived automatically from a suitably stable unique identifier,

   such as a Media Access Control (MAC) address, serial number, Traffic
   Engineering Router ID, or similar.  In the case of inter-domain
   connections, the speaker SHOULD prefix its usual identifier with the
   domain identifier of its residence, such as an Autonomous System
   number, an IGP area identifier, or similar to make sure it remains
   unique.

   The relationship between this identifier and entities in the Traffic
   Engineering database is intentionally left undefined.

   From a manageability point of view, a PCE or PCC implementation
   SHOULD allow the operator to configure this Speaker Entity
   Identifier.

   If a PCEP speaker receives the SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID on a new PCEP
   session, that matches with an existing alive PCEP session, the PCEP
   speaker MUST send a PCErr with Error-type=20 and Error-value=7
   'Received an invalid Speaker Entity Identifier', and close the PCEP
   session.

   [<a id="ref-RFC8231" name="ref-RFC8231">RFC8231</a>] describes the LSP State Synchronization mechanism between
   PCCs and stateful PCEs.  During the State Synchronization, a PCC
   sends the information of all its LSPs (i.e., the full LSP-DB) to the
   stateful PCE.  In order to reduce the State Synchronization overhead
   when there is a small number of LSP state changes in the network
   between the PCEP session restart, this section defines a mechanism
   for incremental (Delta) LSP-DB synchronization.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Motivation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Motivation</span>

   According to [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>], if a PCE restarts and its LSP-DB survived,
   PCCs with a mismatched LSP-DB Version Number will send all their LSPs
   information (full LSP-DB) to the stateful PCE, even if only a small
   number of LSPs underwent state change.  It can take a long time and
   consume large communication channel bandwidth.

   Figure 6 shows an example of LSP State Synchronization.

                        Figure 6: Topology Example

   Assume that there are 320 LSPs in the network, with each PCC having
   80 LSPs.  During the time when the PCEP session is down, 20 LSPs of
   each PCC (i.e., 80 LSPs in total), are changed.  Hence, when the PCEP
   session restarts, the stateful PCE needs to synchronize 320 LSPs with
   all PCCs.  But actually, 240 LSPs stay the same.  If performing full
   LSP State Synchronization, it can take a long time to carry out the
   synchronization of all LSPs.  It is especially true when only a low
   bandwidth communication channel is available (e.g., in-band control
   channel for optical transport networks), and there is a substantial
   number of LSPs in the network.  Another disadvantage of full LSP
   synchronization is that it is a waste of communication bandwidth to
   perform full LSP synchronization given the fact that the number of
   LSP changes can be small during the time when the PCEP session is
   down.

   An incremental (Delta) LSP-DB State Synchronization is described in
   this section, where only the LSPs that underwent state change are
   synchronized between the session restart.  This may include
   new/modified/deleted LSPs.

   [<a id="ref-RFC8231" name="ref-RFC8231">RFC8231</a>] describes State Synchronization and <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> of this
   document describes State Synchronization avoidance by using
   LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in its OPEN object.  This section extends this
   idea to only synchronize the delta (changes) in case of version
   mismatch.

   If both PCEP speakers include the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in the OPEN
   object and the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV values match, the PCC MAY skip
   State Synchronization.  Otherwise, the PCC MUST perform State
   Synchronization.  Incremental State Synchronization capability is
   advertised on a PCEP session during session startup using the
   DELTA-LSP-SYNC-CAPABILITY (D) bit in the capabilities TLV (see
   <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>).  Instead of dumping full LSP-DB to the stateful PCE
   again, the PCC synchronizes the delta (changes) as described in
   Figure 7 when the D and S flags are set to 1 by both the PCC and PCE.
   Other combinations of D and S flags set by the PCC and PCE result in
   full LSP-DB synchronization procedures as described in [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>].  By
   setting the D flag to zero in the OPEN message, a PCEP speaker can
   skip the incremental synchronization optimization, resulting in a
   full LSP-DB synchronization.

              Figure 7: Incremental Synchronization Procedure

   As per <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, the LSP-DB Version Number is incremented each time
   a change is made to the PCC's local LSP-DB.  Each LSP is associated
   with the DB version at the time of its state change.  This is needed
   to determine which LSP and what information needs to be synchronized
   in incremental State Synchronization.  The incremental state sync is
   done from the last LSP-DB version received by the PCE to the latest
   DB version at the PCC.  Note that the LSP-DB Version Number can wrap
   around, in which case the incremental state sync would also wrap till
   the latest LSP-DB Version Number at the PCC.

   In order to carry out incremental State Synchronization, it is not
   necessary for a PCC to store a complete history of LSP-DB change for
   all time, but remember the LSP state changes (including LSP
   modification, setup, and deletion) that the PCE did not get to
   process during the session down.  Note that, a PCC would be unaware
   that a particular LSP report has been processed by the PCE before the
   session to the PCE went down.  So a PCC implementation MAY choose to

   store the LSP-DB Version Number with each LSP at the time its status
   changed, so that when a session is re-established, an incremental
   synchronization can be attempted based on the PCE's last LSP-DB
   Version Number.  For an LSP that is deleted at the PCC, the PCC
   implementation would need to remember the deleted LSP in some way to
   make sure this could be reported as part of incremental
   synchronization later.  The PCC would discard this information based
   on a local policy or when it determines that this information is no
   longer needed with sufficient confidence.  In the example shown in
   Figure 7, the PCC needs to store the LSP state changes that happened
   between DB Versions 43 to 46 and synchronize these changes, when
   performing incremental LSP state update.

   If a PCC finds out it does not have sufficient information to
   complete incremental synchronization after advertising incremental
   LSP State Synchronization capability, it MUST send a PCErr with
   Error-type=20 and Error-value=5 'A PCC indicates to a PCE that it can
   not complete the State Synchronization' (defined in [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>]), and
   terminate the session.  The PCC SHOULD re-establish the session with
   the D bit set to 0 in the OPEN message.

   The other procedures and error checks remain unchanged from the full
   State Synchronization [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>].

   In networks such as optical transport networks, the control channel
   between network nodes can be realized through in-band overhead, thus
   it has limited bandwidth.  With a stateful PCE connected to the
   network via one network node, it is desirable to control the timing
   of PCC State Synchronization so as not to overload the low
   communication channel available in the network during the initial
   synchronization (be it incremental or full) when the session
   restarts, when there is a comparatively large amount of control
   information needing to be synchronized between the stateful PCE and
   the network.  The method proposed, i.e., allowing PCE to trigger the
   State Synchronization, is similar to the function proposed in
   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> but is used in different scenarios and for different

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20PCE-Triggered%20Initial%20State%20Synchronization%20Procedure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  PCE-Triggered Initial State Synchronization Procedure</span>

   Support of PCE-triggered initial State Synchronization is advertised
   during session startup using the TRIGGERED-INITIAL-SYNC (F) bit in
   the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV (see <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>).

   In order to allow a stateful PCE to control the LSP-DB
   synchronization after establishing a PCEP session, both PCEP speakers
   MUST set the F bit to 1 in the OPEN message.  If the LSP-DB-VERSION
   TLV is included by both PCEP speakers and the TLV value matches, the
   State Synchronization can be skipped as described in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.  If
   the TLV is not included or the LSP-DB Version is mismatched, the PCE
   can trigger the State Synchronization process by sending a PCUpd
   message with PLSP-ID = 0 and SYNC = 1.  The PCUpd message SHOULD
   include an empty Explicit Route Object (ERO) (with no ERO sub-object
   and object length of 4) as its intended path and SHOULD NOT include
   the optional objects for its attributes for any parameter update.
   The PCC MUST ignore such an update when the SYNC flag is set.  If the
   TRIGGERED-INITIAL-SYNC capability is not advertised by a PCE and the
   PCC receives a PCUpd with the SYNC flag set to 1, the PCC MUST send a
   PCErr with the SRP-ID-number of the PCUpd, Error-type=20, and
   Error-value=4 'Attempt to trigger a synchronization when the PCE
   triggered synchronization capability has not been advertised' (see
   <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>).  If the TRIGGERED-INITIAL-SYNC capability is advertised
   by a PCE and the PCC, the PCC MUST NOT trigger State Synchronization
   on its own.  If the PCE receives a PCRpt message before the PCE has
   triggered the State Synchronization, the PCE MUST send a PCErr with
   Error-type=20 and Error-value=3 'Attempt to trigger synchronization
   before PCE trigger' (see <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>).

   In this way, the PCE can control the sequence of LSP synchronization
   among all the PCCs that are re-establishing PCEP sessions with it.
   When the capability of PCE control is enabled, only after a PCC
   receives this message, it will start sending information to the PCE.
   This PCE-triggering capability can be applied to both full and
   incremental State Synchronization.  If applied to the latter, the
   PCCs only send information that PCE does not possess, which is
   inferred from the LSP-DB version information exchanged in the OPEN
   message (see <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> for a detailed procedure).

   Once the initial State Synchronization is triggered by the PCE, the
   procedures and error checks remain unchanged [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>].

   If a PCC implementation that does not implement this extension should
   not receive a PCUpd message to trigger State Synchronization as per
   the capability advertisement, but if it were to receive it, it will
   behave as per [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>].

   The accuracy of the computations performed by the PCE is tied to the
   accuracy of the view the PCE has on the state of the LSPs.
   Therefore, it can be beneficial to be able to resynchronize this
   state even after the session has been established.  The PCE may use
   this approach to continuously sanity check its state against the
   network or to recover from error conditions without having to tear
   down sessions.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.2.%20%20PCE-Triggered%20State%20Resynchronization%20Procedure"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" name="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  PCE-Triggered State Resynchronization Procedure</span>

   Support of PCE-triggered state resynchronization is advertised by
   both PCEP speakers during session startup using the TRIGGERED-RESYNC
   (T) bit in the STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV (see <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>).  The PCE
   can choose to resynchronize its entire LSP-DB or a single LSP.

   To trigger resynchronization for an LSP, the PCE sends a Path
   Computation State Update (PCUpd) for the LSP, with the SYNC flag in
   the LSP object set to 1.  The PCE SHOULD NOT include any parameter
   updates for the LSP, and the PCC MUST ignore such an update when the
   SYNC flag is set.  The PCC MUST respond with a PCRpt message with the
   LSP state, SYNC flag set to 0 and MUST include the SRP-ID-number of
   the PCUpd message that triggered the resynchronization.  If the PCC
   cannot find the LSP in its database, PCC MUST also set the R (remove)
   flag [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>] in the LSP object in the PCRpt message.

   The PCE can also trigger resynchronization of the entire LSP-DB.  The
   PCE MUST first mark all LSPs in the LSP-DB that were previously
   reported by the PCC as stale, and then send a PCUpd with an LSP
   object containing a PLSP-ID of 0 and with the SYNC flag set to 1.
   The PCUpd message MUST include an empty ERO (with no ERO sub-object
   and object length of 4) as its intended path and SHOULD NOT include
   the optional objects for its attributes for any parameter update.
   The PCC MUST ignore such update if the SYNC flag is set.  This PCUpd
   message is the trigger for the PCC to enter the synchronization phase
   as described in [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>] and start sending PCRpt messages.  After
   the receipt of the end-of-synchronization marker, the PCE will purge
   LSPs that were not refreshed.  The SRP-ID-number of the PCUpd that
   triggered the resynchronization SHOULD be included in each of the
   PCRpt messages.  If the PCC cannot resynchronize the entire LSP-DB,
   the PCC MUST respond with a PCErr message with Error-type=20 and
   Error-value=5 'cannot complete the State Synchronization' [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>],
   and it MAY terminate the session.  The PCE MUST remove the stale mark
   for the LSPs that were previously reported by the PCC.  Based on the
   local policy, the PCE MAY reattempt synchronization at a later time.

   If the TRIGGERED-RESYNC capability is not advertised by a PCE and the
   PCC receives a PCUpd with the SYNC flag set to 1, it MUST send a
   PCErr with the SRP-ID-number of the PCUpd, Error-type=20, and
   Error-value=4 'Attempt to trigger a synchronization when the PCE
   triggered synchronization capability has not been advertised' (see
   <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>).

   Once the state resynchronization is triggered by the PCE, the
   procedures and error checks remain unchanged from the full state
   synchronization [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>].  This would also include the PCE
   triggering multiple state resynchronization requests while
   synchronization is in progress.

   If a PCC implementation that does not implement this extension should
   not receive a PCUpd message to trigger resynchronization as per the
   capability advertisement, but if it were to receive it, it will

   Support for each of the optimizations described in this document
   requires advertising the corresponding capabilities during session

   The STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV is defined in [<a href="rfc8231.html" title='"Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Stateful PCE"'>RFC8231</a>].  This

   If the S bit (INCLUDE-DB-VERSION) is set to 1 by both PCEP speakers,
   the PCC will include the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in each LSP object.  See
   <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> for details.

   If the D bit (DELTA-LSP-SYNC-CAPABILITY) is set to 1 by a PCEP
   speaker, it indicates that the PCEP speaker allows incremental
   (delta) State Synchronization.  See <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> for details.

   If the F bit (TRIGGERED-INITIAL-SYNC) is set to 1 by both PCEP
   speakers, the PCE SHOULD trigger initial (first) State
   Synchronization.  See <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a> for details.

   A PCE or PCC implementation MUST allow configuring the State

   attack vectors.  An attacker could spoof the SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID and
   pretend to be another PCEP speaker.  An attacker may flood the PCC
   with triggered resynchronization requests at a rate that exceeds the
   PCC's ability to process them by either spoofing messages or
   compromising the PCE itself.  The PCC can respond with a PCErr
   message as described in <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a> and terminate the session.  Thus,
   securing the PCEP session using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [<a href="#ref-PCEPS" title='"Secure Transport for PCEP"'>PCEPS</a>], as per the recommendations and best current practices in
   [<a href="rfc7525.html" title='"Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)"'>RFC7525</a>], is RECOMMENDED.  An administrator could also expose the
   Speaker Entity Identifier as part of the certificate, for the peer
   identity verification.
