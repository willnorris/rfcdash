Abstract

   Cryptographic protocols based on public-key methods have been
   traditionally based on certificates and Public Key Infrastructure
   (PKI) to support certificate management.  The emerging field of
   Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) protocols allows simplification of
   infrastructure requirements via a Private-Key Generator (PKG) while
   providing the same flexibility.  However, one significant limitation
   of IBE methods is that the PKG can end up being a de facto key escrow
   server, with undesirable consequences.  Another observed deficiency
   is a lack of mutual authentication of communicating parties.  This
   document specifies the Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange
   (IBAKE) protocol.  IBAKE does not suffer from the key escrow problem
   and in addition provides mutual authentication as well as perfect
   forward and backward secrecy.

   Authenticated key agreements are cryptographic protocols where two or
   more participants authenticate each other and agree on key material
   used for securing future communication.  These protocols could be
   symmetric key or asymmetric public-key protocols.  Symmetric-key
   protocols require an out-of-band security mechanism to bootstrap a
   secret key.  On the other hand, public-key protocols traditionally
   require certificates and a large-scale Public Key Infrastructure
   (PKI).  Clearly, public-key methods are more flexible; however, the
   requirement for certificates and a large-scale PKI have proved to be
   challenging.  In particular, efficient methods to support large-scale
   certificate revocation and management have proved to be elusive.

   Recently, Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) protocols have been
   proposed as a viable alternative to public-key methods by replacing
   the PKI with a Private-Key Generator (PKG).  However, one significant
   limitation of IBE methods is that the PKG can end up being a de facto

   key escrow entity (i.e., an entity that has sufficient information to
   decrypt communicated data), with undesirable consequences.  Another
   limitation is a lack of mutual authentication between communicating
   parties.  This document specifies an Identity-Based Authenticated Key
   Encryption (IBAKE) protocol that does not suffer from the key escrow
   problem and that provides mutual authentication.  In addition, the
   scheme described in this document allows the use of time-bound public
   identities and corresponding public and private keys, resulting in
   automatic expiration of private keys at the end of a time span
   indicated in the identity itself.  With the self-expiration of the
   public identities, the traditional real-time validity verification
   and revocation procedures used with certificates are not required.
   For example, if the public identity is bound to one day, then, at the
   end of the day, the public/private key pair issued to this peer will
   simply not be valid anymore.  Nevertheless, just as with public-key-
   based certificate systems, if there is a need to revoke keys before
   the designated expiry time, communication with a third party will be
   needed.  Finally, the protocol also provides forward and backward
   secrecy of session keys; i.e., a session key produced using IBAKE is
   always fresh and unrelated to any past or future sessions between the
   protocol participants.

   Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) is a public-key encryption technology
   that allows a public key to be calculated from an identity and a set
   of public parameters, and the corresponding private key to be
   calculated from the public key.  The public key can then be used by
   an Initiator to encrypt messages that the recipient can decrypt using
   the corresponding private key.  The IBE framework is defined in
   [<a href="rfc5091.html" title='"Identity-Based Cryptography Standard (IBCS) #1: Supersingular Curve Implementations of the BF and BB1 Cryptosystems"'>RFC5091</a>], [<a href="rfc5408.html" title='"Identity- Based Encryption Architecture and Supporting Data Structures"'>RFC5408</a>], and [<a href="rfc5409.html" title='"Using the Boneh-Franklin and Boneh-Boyen Identity-Based Encryption Algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5409</a>].

   Responder.  In the figure below, a conceptual signaling diagram of

                 Figure 1: Example IBAKE Message Exchange

   The Initiator (I) and Responder (R) are attempting to mutually
   authenticate each other and agree on a key using IBAKE.  This
   specification assumes that the Initiator and the Responder trust a
   third party -- the PKG.  Rather than a single PKG, different PKGs may
   be involved, e.g., one for the Initiator and one for the Responder.
   The Initiator and the Responder do not share any credentials;
   however, they know or can obtain each other's public identity (key)
   as well as the public parameters of each other's PKG.  This
   specification does not make any assumption on when and how the
   private keys are obtained.  However, to complete the protocol
   described (i.e., to decrypt encrypted messages in the IBAKE protocol
   exchange), the Initiator and the Responder need to have their
   respective private keys.  The procedures needed to obtain the private
   keys and public parameters are outside the scope of this
   specification.  The details of these procedures can be found in
   [<a href="rfc5091.html" title='"Identity-Based Cryptography Standard (IBCS) #1: Supersingular Curve Implementations of the BF and BB1 Cryptosystems"'>RFC5091</a>] and [<a href="rfc5408.html" title='"Identity- Based Encryption Architecture and Supporting Data Structures"'>RFC5408</a>].  Finally, the protocol described in this
   document relies on the use of elliptic curves.  <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> discusses
   the choice of elliptic curves.  However, how the Initiator and the
   Responder agree on a specific elliptic curve is left to the
   application that is leveraging the IBAKE protocol (see [<a href="#ref-EAP-IBAKE" title='"An EAP Authentication Method Based on Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange"'>EAP-IBAKE</a>],
   for example).

   The Initiator chooses a random x.  In the first step, the Initiator
   computes xP (i.e., P, as a point on E, added to itself x times using
   the addition law on E); encrypts xP, the IDi, and the IDr using the
   Responder's public key (e.g., K_PUBr=H1(IDr||date)); and includes

   this encrypted information in MESSAGE_1 sent to the Responder.  In
   this step, encryption refers to IBE as described in [<a href="rfc5091.html" title='"Identity-Based Cryptography Standard (IBCS) #1: Supersingular Curve Implementations of the BF and BB1 Cryptosystems"'>RFC5091</a>] and
   [<a href="rfc5408.html" title='"Identity- Based Encryption Architecture and Supporting Data Structures"'>RFC5408</a>].

   The Responder, upon receiving the message, IBE-decrypts it using its
   private key (e.g., a private key for that date), and obtains xP.  The
   Responder further chooses a random y and computes yP.  The Responder
   then IBE-encrypts the Initiator's identity (IDi), its own identity
   (IDr), xP, and yP using the Initiator's public key (e.g.,
   K_PUBi=H1(IDi||date)).  The Responder includes this encrypted
   information in MESSAGE_2 sent to the Initiator.

   The Initiator, upon receiving and IBE-decrypting MESSAGE_2, obtains
   yP.  Subsequently, the Initiator sends MESSAGE_3, which includes the
   IBE-encrypted IDi, IDr, and yP, to the Responder.  At this point,
   both the Initiator and the Responder are able to compute the same
   session key as xyP.

   Initially, the Initiator selects a random x and computes xP; the
   Initiator MUST use a fresh, random value for x on each run of the
   protocol.  The Initiator then encrypts xP, the IDi, and the IDr using
   the Responder's public key (e.g., K_PUBr=H1(IDr||date)).  The
   Initiator includes this encrypted information in MESSAGE_1 and sends
   it to the Responder, as shown below.

   Initiator   ----&gt;   Responder

      MESSAGE_1 = E(K_PUBr, IDi || IDr || xP)

   Upon receiving MESSAGE_1, the Responder SHALL perform the following:

   o  Decrypt the message as specified in [<a href="rfc5091.html" title='"Identity-Based Cryptography Standard (IBCS) #1: Supersingular Curve Implementations of the BF and BB1 Cryptosystems"'>RFC5091</a>] and [<a href="rfc5408.html" title='"Identity- Based Encryption Architecture and Supporting Data Structures"'>RFC5408</a>].

   o  Obtain xP.

   o  Select a random y and compute yP.  The Responder MUST use a fresh,
      random value for x on each run of the protocol.

   o  Encrypt the Initiator's identity (IDi), its own identity (IDr),
      xP, and yP using the Initiator's public key (K_PUBi).

   Upon receiving MESSAGE_2, the Initiator SHALL perform the following:

   o  Decrypt the message as specified in [<a href="rfc5091.html" title='"Identity-Based Cryptography Standard (IBCS) #1: Supersingular Curve Implementations of the BF and BB1 Cryptosystems"'>RFC5091</a>] and [<a href="rfc5408.html" title='"Identity- Based Encryption Architecture and Supporting Data Structures"'>RFC5408</a>].

   o  Verify that the received xP is the same as that sent in MESSAGE_1.

   o  Obtain yP.

   o  Encrypt its own identity (IDi), the Responder's identity (IDr),
      and yP using the Responder's public key (K_PUBi).

   Initiator   ----&gt;   Responder

      MESSAGE_3 = E(K_PUBr, IDi || IDr || yP)

   Upon receiving MESSAGE_3, the Responder SHALL perform the following:

   o  Verify that the received yP is the same as that sent in MESSAGE_2.

   If any of the above verifications fail, the protocol halts;
   otherwise, following this exchange, both the Initiator and the
   Responder have authenticated each other and are able to compute xyP
   as the session key.  At this point, both protocol participants MUST
   discard all intermediate cryptographic values, including x and y.
   Similarly, both parties MUST immediately discard these values
   whenever the protocol terminates as a result of a verification
   failure or timeout.

   Properties of the protocol are as follows:

   o  Immunity from key escrow: Observe that all of the steps in the
      protocol exchange are encrypted using IBE.  So, clearly, the PKG
      can decrypt all of the exchanges.  However, given the assumption
      that PKGs are trusted and well behaved (e.g., PKGs will not mount
      an active man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack), they cannot compute
      the session key.  This is because of the hardness of the Elliptic
      Curve Diffie-Hellman problem.  In other words, given xP and yP, it
      is computationally hard to compute xyP.

   o  Mutually authenticated key agreement: Observe that all of the
      steps in the protocol exchange are encrypted using IBE.  In
      particular, only the Responder and its corresponding PKG can
      decrypt the contents of MESSAGE_1 and MESSAGE_3 sent by the
      Initiator, and similarly only the Initiator and its corresponding



<span class="grey">Cakulev, et al.               Informational                     [Page 7]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6539.html">RFC 6539</a>                          IBAKE                       March 2012</span>


      PKG can decrypt the contents of MESSAGE_2 sent by the Responder.
      Again, given the assumption made above -- that PKGs are trusted
      and well behaved (e.g., a PKG will not impersonate a user to which
      it issued a private key) -- upon receiving MESSAGE_2, the
      Initiator can verify the Responder's authenticity, since xP could
      have been sent in MESSAGE_2 only after decryption of the contents
      of MESSAGE_1 by the Responder.  Similarly, upon receiving
      MESSAGE_3, the Responder can verify the Initiator's authenticity,
      since yP could have been sent back in MESSAGE_3 only after correct
      decryption of the contents of MESSAGE_2 by the Initiator.
      Finally, both the Initiator and the Responder can agree on the
      same session key.  In other words, IBAKE is a mutually
      authenticated key agreement protocol based on IBE.  The hardness
      of the key agreement protocol relies on the hardness of the
      Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman problem.  Thus, in any practical
      implementation, care should be devoted to the choice of elliptic
      curve.

   o  Perfect forward and backward secrecy: Since x and y are random,
      xyP is always fresh and unrelated to any past or future sessions
      between the Initiator and the Responder.

   o  No passwords: Clearly, the IBAKE protocol does not require any
      offline exchange of passwords or secret keys between the Initiator
      and the Responder.  In fact, the method is applicable to any two
      parties communicating for the first time through any communication
      network.  The only requirement is to ensure that both the
      Initiator and the Responder are aware of each other's public keys
      and the public parameters of the PKG that generated the
      corresponding private keys.

   o  PKG availability: Observe that PKGs need not be contacted during
      an IBAKE protocol exchange, which dramatically reduces the
      availability requirements on PKGs.

   o  Choice of elliptic curves: This specification relies on the use of
      elliptic curves for both IBE and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
      exchange.  When making a decision on the choice of elliptic
      curves, it is beneficial to choose two different elliptic curves
      -- a non-supersingular curve for the internal calculations of
      Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman values xP and yP, and a
      supersingular curve for the IBE encryption/decryption.  For the
      calculations of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman values, it is
      beneficial to use the curves recommended by NIST [<a href="#ref-FIPS-186" title='"Digital Signature Standard (DSS)"'>FIPS-186</a>].
      These curves make the calculations simpler while keeping the
      security high.  On the other hand, IBE systems are based on
      bilinear pairings.  Therefore, the choice of an elliptic curve for

      IBE is restricted to a family of supersingular elliptic curves
      over finite fields of large prime characteristic.  The appropriate
      elliptic curves for IBE are described in [<a href="rfc5091.html" title='"Identity-Based Cryptography Standard (IBCS) #1: Supersingular Curve Implementations of the BF and BB1 Cryptosystems"'>RFC5091</a>].

   o  Implementation considerations: An implementation of IBAKE would
      consist of two primary modules, i.e., point addition operations
      over a NIST curve, and IBE operations over a supersingular curve.
      The implementation of both modules only needs to be aware of the
      following parameters: (a) the full description of the curves that
      are in use (fixed or negotiated), (b) the public parameters of the
      PKG used for the derivation of IBE private keys, and (c) the exact
      public identity of each IBAKE participant.  The knowledge of these
      parameters is sufficient to perform Elliptic Curve Cryptography
      (ECC) operations in different terminals and produce the same
      results, independently of the implementation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document is based on the basic IBE protocol, as specified in
   [<a href="#ref-BF" title='"Identity-Based Encryption from the Weil Pairing"'>BF</a>], [<a href="rfc5091.html" title='"Identity-Based Cryptography Standard (IBCS) #1: Supersingular Curve Implementations of the BF and BB1 Cryptosystems"'>RFC5091</a>]), [<a href="rfc5408.html" title='"Identity- Based Encryption Architecture and Supporting Data Structures"'>RFC5408</a>], and [<a href="rfc5409.html" title='"Using the Boneh-Franklin and Boneh-Boyen Identity-Based Encryption Algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5409</a>], and as such inherits some
   properties of that protocol.  For instance, by concatenating the
   "date" with the identity (to derive the public key), the need for any
   key revocation mechanisms is virtually eliminated.  Moreover, by
   allowing the participants to acquire multiple private keys (e.g., for
   duration of contract) the availability requirements on the PKG are
   also reduced without any reduction in security.  The granularity
   associated with the date is a matter of security policy and as such
   is a decision made by the PKG administrator.  However, the
   granularity applicable to any given participant should be publicly
   available and known to other participants.  For example, this
   information can be made available in the same venue that provides
   "public information" on a PKG server (i.e., P, sP) needed to
   execute IBE.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20General"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  General</span>

   Attacks on the cryptographic algorithms used in IBE are outside the
   scope of this document.  It is assumed that any administrator will
   pay attention to the desired strengths of the relevant cryptographic
   algorithms based on an up-to-date understanding of the strength of
   these algorithms from published literature, as well as to known
   attacks.

   It is assumed that the PKGs are secure, not compromised, trusted, and
   will not engage in launching active attacks independently or in a
   collaborative environment.  Nevertheless, if an active adversary can
   fool the parties into believing that it is a legitimate PKG, then it
   can mount a successful MitM attack.  Therefore, care should be taken



<span class="grey">Cakulev, et al.               Informational                     [Page 9]</span></pre>

   when choosing a PKG.  In addition, any malicious insider could
   potentially launch passive attacks (by decryption of one or more
   message exchanges offline).  While it is in the best interest of
   administrators to prevent such an issue, it is hard to eliminate this
   problem.  Hence, it is assumed that such problems will persist, and
   hence the session key agreement protocols are designed to protect
   participants from passive adversaries.

   It is also assumed that the communication between participants and
   their respective PKGs is secure.  Therefore, in any implementation of
   the protocols described in this document, administrators of any PKG
   have to ensure that communication with participants is secure and not
   compromised.

   Finally, concatenating the date to the identity ensures that the
   corresponding private key is applicable only to that date.  This
   serves to limit the damage related to a leakage or compromise of
   private keys to just that date.  This, in particular, eliminates the
   revocation mechanisms that are typical to various certificate-based
   public key protocols.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20IBAKE%20Protocol"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  IBAKE Protocol</span>

   For the basic IBAKE protocol, from a cryptographic perspective, the
   following security considerations apply.

   In every step, IBE is used, with the recipient's public key.  This
   guarantees that only the intended recipient of the message and its
   corresponding PKG can decrypt the message [<a href="#ref-BF" title='"Identity-Based Encryption from the Weil Pairing"'>BF</a>].

   Next, the use of identities within the encrypted payload is intended
   to eliminate some basic reflection attacks.  For instance, suppose we
   did not use identities as part of the encrypted payload, in the first
   step of the IBAKE protocol exchange (i.e., MESSAGE_1 of Figure 1 in
   <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>).  Furthermore, assume that an adversary has access to
   the conversation between the Initiator and the Responder and can
   actively snoop packets and drop/modify them before routing them to
   the destination.  For instance, assume that the IP source address and
   destination address can be modified by the adversary.  After the
   first message is sent by the Initiator (to the Responder), the
   adversary can take over and trap the packet.  Next, the adversary can
   modify the IP source address to include the adversary's IP address,
   before routing it on to the Responder.  The Responder will assume
   that the request for an IBAKE session came from the adversary, and
   will execute step 2 of the IBAKE protocol exchange (i.e., MESSAGE_2
   of Figure 1 in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) but encrypt it using the adversary's
   public key.  The above message can be decrypted by the adversary (and
   only by the adversary).  In particular, since the second message



<span class="grey">Cakulev, et al.               Informational                    [Page 10]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-11" id="page-11" name="page-11"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6539.html">RFC 6539</a>                          IBAKE                       March 2012</span>


   includes the challenge sent by the Initiator to the Responder, the
   adversary will now learn the challenge sent by the Initiator.
   Following this, the adversary can carry on a conversation with the
   Initiator, "pretending" to be the Responder.  This attack will be
   eliminated if identities are used as part of the encrypted payload.
   In summary, at the end of the exchange, both the Initiator and the
   Responder can mutually authenticate each other and agree on a
   session key.

   Recall that IBE guarantees that only the recipient of the message can
   decrypt the message using the private key, with the caveat that the
   PKG that generated the private key of the recipient of the message
   can decrypt the message as well.  However, the PKG cannot learn the
   public key xyP given xP and yP, based on the hardness of the Elliptic
   Curve Diffie-Hellman problem.  This property of resistance to passive
   key escrow from the PKG is not applicable to the basic IBE protocols
   proposed in [<a href="rfc5091.html" title='"Identity-Based Cryptography Standard (IBCS) #1: Supersingular Curve Implementations of the BF and BB1 Cryptosystems"'>RFC5091</a>]), [<a href="rfc5408.html" title='"Identity- Based Encryption Architecture and Supporting Data Structures"'>RFC5408</a>], and [<a href="rfc5409.html" title='"Using the Boneh-Franklin and Boneh-Boyen Identity-Based Encryption Algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>RFC5409</a>].

   Observe that the protocol works even if the Initiator and Responder
   belong to two different PKGs.  In particular, the parameters used for
   encryption to the Responder and parameters used for encryption to the
   Initiator can be completely different and independent of each other.
   Moreover, the elliptic curve used to generate the session key xyP can
   be completely different and can be chosen during the key exchange.
   If such flexibility is desired, then it would be required to add
   optional extra data to the protocol to exchange the algebraic
   primitives used in deriving the session key.

   In addition to mutual authentication and resistance to passive
   escrow, the Diffie-Hellman property of the session key exchange
   guarantees perfect secrecy of keys.  In other words, accidental
   leakage of one session key does not compromise past or future session
   keys between the same Initiator and Responder.
