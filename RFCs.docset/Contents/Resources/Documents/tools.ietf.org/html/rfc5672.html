<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   About the purpose for DKIM, [<a href="rfc4871.html" title='"DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures"'>RFC4871</a>] states:

      The ultimate goal of this framework is to permit a signing domain
      to assert responsibility for a message, thus protecting message
      signer identity...

   Hence, DKIM has a signer that produces a signed message, a verifier
   that confirms the signature, and an assessor that consumes the
   validated signing domain.  So, the simple purpose of DKIM is to
   communicate an identifier to a receive-side assessor module.  The
   identifier is in the form of a domain name that refers to a
   responsible identity.  For DKIM to be interoperable and useful, the
   signer and assessor must share the same understanding of the details
   about the identifier.

   However, the <a href="rfc4871.html">RFC 4871</a> specification defines two, potentially
   different, identifiers that are carried in the DKIM-Signature: header
   field, d= and i=.  Either might be delivered to a receiving
   processing module that consumes validated payload.  The DKIM
   specification fails to clearly define which is the "payload" to be
   delivered to a consuming module, versus what is internal and merely
   in support of achieving payload delivery.




<span class="grey">Crocker                     Standards Track                     [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-3" id="page-3" name="page-3"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5672.html">RFC 5672</a>                    <a href="rfc4871.html">RFC 4871</a> Update                  August 2009</span>


   This currently leaves signers and assessors with the potential for
   making different interpretations between the two identifiers and may
   lead to interoperability problems.  A signer could intend one to be
   used for assessment, and have a different intent in setting the value
   in the other.  However the verifier might choose the wrong value to
   deliver to the assessor, thereby producing an unintended (and
   inaccurate) assessment.

   This Update resolves that confusion.  It defines additional, semantic
   labels for the two values, clarifies their nature, and specifies
   their relationship.  More specifically, it clarifies that the
   identifier intended for delivery to the assessor -- such as one that
   consults a whitelist -- is the value of the "d=" tag.  However, this
   does not prohibit message filtering engines from using the "i=" tag,
   or any other information in the message's header, for filtering
   decisions.

   For signers and verifiers that have been using the i= tag as the
   primary value that is delivered to the assessor, a software change to
   using the d= tag is intended.

   So, this Update clarifies the formal interface to DKIM, after
   signature verification has been performed.  It distinguishes DKIM's
   internal signing and verification activity, from its standardized
   delivery of data to that interface.

   The focus of the Update is on the portion of DKIM that is much like
   an API definition.  If DKIM is implemented as a software library for
   use by others, it needs to define what outputs are provided, that is,
   what data that an application developer who uses the library can
   expect to obtain as a result of invoking DKIM on a message.

   This Update defines the output of that library to include the yes/no
   result of the verification and the "d=" value.  In other words, it
   says what (one) identifier was formally specified for use by the
   signer and whether the use of that identifier has been validated.
   For a particular library, other information can be provided at the
   discretion of the library developer, since developers of assessors --
   these are the consumers of the DKIM library -- well might want more
   information than the standardized two pieces of information.
   However, that standardized set is the minimum that is required to be
   provided to a consuming module, in order to be able to claim that the
   library is DKIM compliant.

   This does not state what the implicit value of "i=" is, relative to
   "d=".  In this context, that fact is irrelevant.

   versus the TCP protocol itself.  There is the activity within the
   protocol stack, and then there is the activity within in the software

      identities in other header fields seek to apply basic
      authentication into the semantics of trust associated with a

      an attacker.  Hence reliance on the use of these options

         The AUID is specified as having the same syntax as an email

         Notably, the domain name is not required to be registered in

      order to limit the capability of such keys when this is not
      intended, the "s" flag may be set in the "t=" tag of the key
      record to constrain the validity of the record to exactly the
      domain of the signing identity.  If the referenced key record
      contains the "s" flag as part of the "t=" tag, the domain of the

   Original Text:   (None.  New section.  Additional text.)

   Corrected Text:

      DKIM's primary task is to communicate from the Signer to a
      recipient-side Identity Assessor a single Signing Domain
      Identifier (SDID) that refers to a responsible identity.  DKIM MAY
      optionally provide a single responsible Agent or User Identifier
      (AUID).

      Hence, DKIM's mandatory output to a receive-side Identity Assessor
      is a single domain name.  Within the scope of its use as DKIM
      output, the name has only basic domain name semantics; any
      possible owner-specific semantics are outside the scope of DKIM.
      That is, within its role as a DKIM identifier, additional
      semantics cannot be assumed by an Identity Assessor.

      A receive-side DKIM verifier MUST communicate the Signing Domain
      Identifier (d=) to a consuming Identity Assessor module and MAY
      communicate the Agent or User Identifier (i=) if present.

      To the extent that a receiver attempts to intuit any structured
      semantics for either of the identifiers, this is a heuristic
      function that is outside the scope of DKIM's specification and
      semantics.  Hence, it is relegated to a higher-level service, such
      as a delivery handling filter that integrates a variety of inputs
      and performs heuristic analysis of them.

      INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION: This document does not require the value
      of the SDID or AUID to match the identifier in any other message
      header field.  This requirement is, instead, an assessor policy
      issue.  The purpose of such a linkage would be to authenticate the
      value in that other header field.  This, in turn, is the basis for
      applying a trust assessment based on the identifier value.  Trust
      is a broad and complex topic and trust mechanisms are subject to
      highly creative attacks.  The real-world efficacy of any but the
      most basic bindings between the SDID or AUID and other identities
      is not well established, nor is its vulnerability to subversion by
      an attacker.  Hence, reliance on the use of such bindings should
      be strictly limited.  In particular, it is not at all clear to
      what extent a typical end-user recipient can rely on any
      assurances that might be made by successful use of the SDID or
      AUID.

      presents an opportunity to a receiving system that unauthenticated
      email cannot.  Specifically, an authenticated email creates a
      predictable identifier by which other decisions can reliably be
      managed, such as trust and reputation.  Conversely,
      unauthenticated email lacks a reliable identifier that can be used
      to assign trust and reputation.

   Corrected Text:

      It is beyond the scope of this specification to describe what
      actions an Identity Assessor can make, but mail carrying a
      validated SDID presents an opportunity to an Identity Assessor
      that unauthenticated email does not.  Specifically, an
      authenticated email creates a predictable identifier by which
      other decisions can reliably be managed, such as trust and
      reputation.

   Original Text:

      Once the signature has been verified, that information MUST be
      conveyed to higher-level systems (such as explicit allow/
      whitelists and reputation systems) and/or to the end user.  If the
      message is signed on behalf of any address other than that in the
      From: header field, the mail system SHOULD take pains to ensure
      that the actual signing identity is clear to the reader.

   This Update clarifies core details about DKIM's payload.  As such, it
   affects interoperability, semantic characterization, and the
   expectations for the identifiers carried with a DKIM signature.
   Clarification of these details is likely to limit misinterpretation
   of DKIM's semantics.  Since DKIM is fundamentally a security
   protocol, this should improve its security characteristics.

   This document was initially formulated by an ad hoc design team,
   comprising: Jon Callas, D. Crocker, J. D. Falk, Michael Hammer, Tony
   Hansen, Murray Kucherawy, John Levine, Jeff Macdonald, Ellen Siegel,
   and Wietse Venema.  The final version of the document was developed
   through vigorous discussion in the IETF DKIM working group.
