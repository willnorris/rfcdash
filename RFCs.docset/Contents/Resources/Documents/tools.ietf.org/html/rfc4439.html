   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to a Fibre Channel network's Fabric Address Manager.  Fabric Address
   Manager refers to the functionality of acquiring DomainID(s) as
   specified in [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-3" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 3 (FC-SW-3)"'>FC-SW-3</a>], and managing Fibre Channel Identifiers as
   specified in [<a href="#ref-FC-FS" title='"Fibre Channel - Framing and Signaling (FC-FS)"'>FC-FS</a>].

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to <a href="rfc3410.html#section-7">section 7 of
   RFC 3410</a> [<a href="rfc3410.html" title='"Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet- Standard Management Framework"'>RFC3410</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="rfc2578.html" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="rfc2579.html" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="rfc2580.html">RFC 2580</a>

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols such
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
   Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are
   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an

   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the Fabric, each node, and
   most ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [<a href="#ref-FC-FS" title='"Fibre Channel - Framing and Signaling (FC-FS)"'>FC-FS</a>].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers, which
   identify the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has
   both an address identifier and a WWN.  When a Fabric is in use, the
   FC address identifiers are dynamically assigned by a switch.  Each
   octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy,
   with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.

   Each switch in a Fabric is assigned one (or more) unique Domain_IDs
   using a two-step process.  First, one switch, called Principal
   Switch, is selected from the switches of a Fabric.  Then, the
   Principal Switch assigns Domain_IDs to the other switches of the
   Fabric.  Address assignment within a domain is performed by the

   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [<a href="rfc2837.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fabric Element in Fibre Channel Standard"'>RFC2837</a>] was focused on
   Fibre Channel switches.  It is being replaced by the more generic
   Fibre Channel Management MIB [<a href="#ref-FC-MGMT" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>FC-MGMT</a>], which defines basic
   information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including
   extensions to the standard IF-MIB [<a href="#ref-IF-MIB" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>IF-MIB</a>] for Fibre Channel
   interfaces.  [<a href="#ref-FC-MGMT" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>FC-MGMT</a>] includes the specification of how the generic
   objects defined in [<a href="#ref-IF-MIB" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>IF-MIB</a>] apply to Fibre Channel interfaces.

   Note that an interface's ifIndex value must be unique within an SNMP
   context, irrespective of how many Fibre Channel management instances
   (see below) and how many Fibre Channel switches are instrumented
   within that SNMP context.

   This document defines the T11-FC-FABRIC-ADDR-MGR-MIB module, which
   extends beyond [<a href="#ref-FC-MGMT" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>FC-MGMT</a>] to cover the functionality, in Fibre Channel
   switches, which is used to manage Fabric configuration, domains, and
   addresses within a domain.

   This document also contains a MIB module, T11-TC-MIB, to define
   textual conventions that might also be useful in other MIBs defined
   by T11.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20MIB%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  MIB Overview</span>

   This section explains the use of a Fibre Channel management instance,
   a Switch Index, and a Fabric Index.  It also describes the six MIB
   groups contained in the MIB.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20Fibre%20Channel%20Management%20Instance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Fibre Channel Management Instance</span>

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [<a href="#ref-FC-MGMT" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>FC-MGMT</a>] as a
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.  Fibre
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
   implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a
   single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX sub-agents, with each sub-
   agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB
   [<a href="#ref-FC-MGMT" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>FC-MGMT</a>] as the index value to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel
   management instance.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Switch%20Index"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Switch Index</span>

   The FC-MGMT-MIB [<a href="#ref-FC-MGMT" title='"Fibre Channel Management MIB"'>FC-MGMT</a>] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of
   information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed by Fibre
   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance
   can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,
   fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value
   to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or
   more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.%20%20Fabric%20Index"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" name="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Fabric Index</span>

   The [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-3" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 3 (FC-SW-3)"'>FC-SW-3</a>] standard for an interconnecting Fabric consisting of
   multiple Fabric Switch elements describes the operation of a single
   Fabric in a physical infrastructure.  The current [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-4" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 4 (FC-SW-4)"'>FC-SW-4</a>] standard
   also supports the operation of multiple Virtual Fabrics operating
   within one (or more) physical infrastructures.  In such a scenario,
   each Fabric has, of course, its own management instrumentation.  In
   order to accommodate this scenario, this MIB module defines all
   Fabric-related information in tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary
   integer, named a "Fabric Index".  In a Fabric that is conformant to
   [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-3" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 3 (FC-SW-3)"'>FC-SW-3</a>], the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.

   It is quite possible, and may even become likely, that (a port of) a
   Fibre Channel switch will be connected to multiple such Fabrics.
   Thus, in order to simplify a query concerning all the Fabrics to
   which a single switch is connected, fcmSwitchIndex will be listed
   before t11FamFabricIndex when they both appear in the same INDEX
   clause.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.4.%20%20The%20t11FamGroup%20Group"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4" name="section-5.4">5.4</a>.  The t11FamGroup Group</span>

   This group contains basic information about the Fabric Address
   Manager functionality within a switch, including its configuration
   parameters that are per-interface (i.e., specified for a particular
   Fibre Channel interface identified by an ifIndex value).

   This conditional mandatory group contains information about all the

   This cache is kept to support the concept of Preferred Domain_ID via
   a best-effort attempt for (short-term) re-assignment of the same FC

   Included in [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-3" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 3 (FC-SW-3)"'>FC-SW-3</a>] is the specification of Reconfigure Fabric
   (RCF) and Build Fabric (BF), both of which are command codes of the
   Switch Fabric Internal Link Service (SW_ILS).  [<a href="#ref-FC-SW-3" title='"Fibre Channel - Switch Fabric - 3 (FC-SW-3)"'>FC-SW-3</a>] includes the
   warning:



<span class="grey">DeSanti, et al.             Standards Track                     [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-7" id="page-7" name="page-7"> </a>

      NOTE 13 - Since the RCF causes a complete reconfiguration of the
      Fabric, and may cause addresses allocated to a Switch to change,
      this SW_ILS should be used with caution.  The BF SW_ILS allows the
      Fabric to attempt reconfiguration without loss of or change of
      address and therefore should be attempted before an RCF.  Examples
      of situations in which RCF may be appropriate include resolution
      of overlapped Domains, or the failure of a Fabric Reconfiguration
      initiated by a BF.

   Further, [<a href="#ref-FC-MI" title='"Fibre Channel - Methodologies for Interconnects (FC-MI)"'>FC-MI</a>] specifies:

      A Fabric is prohibited from autonomously generating an RCF, but an
      outside administrative function may request a switch to generate
      an RCF.  Such an administrative function is outside the scope of
      this technical report.

   The T11-FC-FABRIC-ADDR-MGR-MIB defined in this document is consistent
   with both of the above quotes since it defines two objects,
   t11FamAutoReconfigure and t11FamRestart, which are defined with a
   MAX-ACCESS of read-write, and setting them to the appropriate value
   is a means by which "an outside administrative function may request a
   switch to generate an RCF" [<a href="#ref-FC-MI" title='"Fibre Channel - Methodologies for Interconnects (FC-MI)"'>FC-MI</a>].

   Note, however, the MIB specifies in its compliance section that the
   minimum required level of support for these two objects is read-only.

   Further, for both t11FamAutoReconfigure and t11FamRestart, the MIB
   serves only as a request to generate; it does not represent the
   action of the RCF or BF.  That is, a successful SNMP SetRequest on
   these objects will cause an RCF (or BF) to be sent, but SNMP does
   not/cannot ensure the successful operation of the SW_ILS operation.

           "The MIB module for the Fabric Address management
           functionality defined by the Fibre Channel standards.  For
           the purposes of this MIB, Fabric Address Manager refers to
           the functionality of acquiring DomainID(s) as specified in
           FC-SW-3, and managing Fibre Channel Identifiers as specified
           in FC-FS.  An instance of 'Fabric Address Manager' software
           functionality executes in the Principal Switch, and in each
           other switch.

           After an agent reboot, the values of read-write objects
           defined in this MIB module are implementation-dependent.

             represented by the first row in Table 86.

           - 'unconfigured' represents a switch that requires
             operator input before it can begin the process
             represented by the first row in Table 86.

           - 'principalSwitchSelection' represents a switch engaged
             in the process represented by the second row in

             in state F1 of Figure 15.

           - 'stable' represents a switch that has successfully
             completed the process represented by the third row in
             Table 86 and has at least one E_Port.

           - 'stableWithNoEports' represents a switch that has
             successfully completed the process represented by the
             third row in Table 86 but has no E_Ports.

           - 'noDomains' represents a switch that has completed
             the process represented by the third row in Table 86
             but failed to obtain a Domain_ID.

           - 'disabled' represents any situation in which the
             corresponding instance of t11FamEnable has the value
             'false'.

t11FamConfigDomainId OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      FcDomainIdOrZero
    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
           "The configured Domain_ID of the particular switch on this
           Fabric, or zero if no Domain_ID has been configured.
           The meaning of this object depends on
           t11FamConfigDomainIdType object.

           If t11FamConfigDomainIdType is 'preferred', then the
           configured Domain_ID is called the 'preferred Domain_ID'.
           Valid values are between 0 and 239.  In a situation where
           this Domain_ID cannot be assigned, any other Domain_ID
           will be acceptable.  A value of zero means any Domain_ID.

           If t11FamConfigDomainIdType is 'insistent', then the
           configured Domain_ID is called the 'insistent Domain_ID' and
           valid values are between 1 and 239.  In a situation where
           this Domain_ID cannot be assigned, no other Domain_ID is
           acceptable.

           In both of the above cases, the switch sends an RDI (Request
           Domain_ID) to request this Domain_ID to the Principal
           Switch.  If no Domain_ID is able to be granted in the case
           of 'preferred', or if an 'insistent' Domain_ID is configured
           but not able to be granted, then it is an error condition.
           When this error occurs, the switch will continue as if it
           receives a SW_RJT with a reason/explanation of 'Unable to
           perform command request'/'Domain_ID not available'.  That
           is, its E_Ports on that Fabric will be isolated and the
           administrator informed via a 't11FamDomainIdNotAssigned'
           notification.

           If t11FamConfigDomainIdType is 'static', then the configured
           Domain_ID is called the 'static Domain_ID' and valid values
           are between 1 and 239.  In this situation, there is no
           Principal Switch in the Fabric and the Domain_ID is simply
           assigned by configuration, together with the Fabric_Name.
           A switch configured with a static Domain_ID, on receiving
           an EFP, BF, RCF, DIA, or RDI SW_ILS, shall reply with an
           SW_RJT having Reason Code Explanation 'E_Port is Isolated'
           and shall isolate the receiving E_Port.

           "This table contains all the Fibre Channel Address
           Identifiers that have recently been released by the
           Fabric Address Manager in a switch.  So, it lists

           WWN-to-Fibre Channel Address Identifier mappings and are
           currently not assigned to any ports.  These Fibre Channel
           Address Identifiers were assigned to ports but have since
           been released.  These cached Fibre Channel Address
           Identifiers contain only Area_ID and Port_ID information.
           This cache is kept to provide best-effort re-assignment of
           same Fibre Channel Address Identifiers; i.e., when an
           Nx_Port asks for a Fibre Channel Address Identifier, soon
           after releasing one, the same value is re-assigned, if

   IANA has made two MIB OID assignments, one for the T11-TC-MIB module
   and one for the T11-FC-FABRIC-ADDR-MGR-MIB module, under the
   appropriate subtree(s).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11" name="section-11">11</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

         t11FamConfigDomainId, t11FamConfigDomainIdType and
         t11FamContiguousAllocation -- ability to change the address
         allocation policy.

         t11FamRestart and t11FamAutoReconfigure -- ability to cause a
         fabric reconfiguration, e.g., on certain error conditions.

         t11FamPriority -- ability to affect which switch becomes the
         Principal Switch.

         t11FamRcFabricNotifyEnable -- ability to enable/disable a
         notification.

         t11FamIfRcfReject -- ability to change the switch's behavior on
         receipt of an RCF.

         t11FamIfRowStatus -- ability to change an interface
         configuration parameter.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may also be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:

         t11FamTable and t11FamIfTable -- contain the configuration,
         status, and statistics of the Fabric Address Manager.

         t11FamAreaTable, t11FamDatabaseTable and t11FamFcIdCacheTable
         -- contain information on currently assigned or recently-
         released addresses.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="rfc3410.html#section-8">[RFC3410], section 8</a>),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
