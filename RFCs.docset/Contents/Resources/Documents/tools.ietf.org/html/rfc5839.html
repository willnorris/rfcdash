        <span class="h1">An Extension to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Events</span>
                   <span class="h1">for Conditional Event Notification</span>

Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables
   receiving asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP
   user agents.  This framework defines the procedures for creating,
   refreshing, and terminating subscriptions, as well as fetching and
   periodic polling of resource state.  These procedures provide no
   tools to avoid replaying event notifications that have already been
   received by a user agent.  This memo defines an extension to SIP
   events that allows the subscriber to condition the subscription
   request to whether the state has changed since the previous
   notification was received.  When such a condition is true, either the
   body of a resulting event notification or the entire notification
   message is suppressed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework provides an
   extensible facility for requesting notification of certain events
   from other SIP user agents.  This framework includes procedures for
   creating, refreshing, and terminating subscriptions, as well as the
   possibility to fetch or periodically poll the event resource.

   Several instantiations of this framework, called event packages have
   been defined, e.g., for presence [<a href="rfc3856.html" title='"A Presence Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3856</a>], message waiting
   indications [<a href="rfc3842.html" title='"A Message Summary and Message Waiting Indication Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>RFC3842</a>], and registrations [<a href="rfc3680.html" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Registrations"'>RFC3680</a>].

   By default, every SUBSCRIBE request generates a NOTIFY request
   containing the latest event state.  Typically, a SUBSCRIBE request is
   issued by the subscriber whenever it needs a subscription to be
   installed, periodically refreshed, or terminated.  Once the
   subscription has been installed, the majority of the NOTIFYs
   generated by the subscription refreshes are superfluous; the
   subscriber usually is in possession of the event state already,
   except in the unlikely case where a state change exactly coincides
   with the periodic subscription refresh.  In most cases, the final
   event state generated upon terminating the subscription similarly
   contains resource state that the subscriber already has.

   Fetching or polling of resource state behaves in a similarly
   suboptimal way in cases where the state has not changed since the
   previous poll occurred.  In general, the problem lies with the
   inability to persist state across a SUBSCRIBE request.

   This memo defines an extension to optimize the SIP events framework.
   This extension allows a notifier to tag notifications (called entity-
   tags hereafter) and the subscriber to condition its subsequent
   SUBSCRIBE requests for actual changes since a notification carrying
   that entity-tag was issued.  The solution is similar to conditional
   requests defined in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [<a href="rfc2616.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>],
   and follows the mechanism already defined for the PUBLISH [<a href="rfc3903.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication"'>RFC3903</a>]
   method for issuing conditional event publications.

      An object identified by a URI whose resource state can be accessed
      using the SIP Event Notification framework.  There is a single
      authoritative notifier responsible for communicating the resource
      state.

   entity
      The representation of resource state.  An entity consists of the
      state data carried in the body of a NOTIFY message, as well as
      related meta-data in the message header.  There may be many
      versions of an entity, one current and the others stale.  Each
      version of an entity is identified by an entity-tag, which is
      guaranteed to be unique across all versions of all entities for a
      resource and event package.

   A SUBSCRIBE request creates a subscription with a finite lifetime.
   This lifetime is negotiated using the Expires header field, and
   unless the subscription is refreshed by the subscriber before the
   expiration is met, the subscription is terminated.  The frequency of
   these subscription refreshes depends on the event package, and
   typically ranges from minutes to hours.

   The SIP events framework does not include different protocol methods
   for initiating and terminating of subscriptions, subscription
   refreshes, and fetches inside and outside of the SIP dialog.  The
   SUBSCRIBE method is overloaded to perform all of these functions.
   The difference between a fetch that does not create a (lasting)
   subscription and a SUBSCRIBE that creates one is in the Expires

   header field value of the SUBSCRIBE; a zero-expiry SUBSCRIBE only
   generates a single NOTIFY, after which the subscription immediately
   terminates.  Lasting subscriptions typically have relatively short
   expiry periods, requiring periodic sending of new SUBSCRIBE requests
   in order to refresh the subscription.

   Each new SUBSCRIBE request generates a NOTIFY request containing the
   latest resource state.  Even if the state has not changed, it is sent
   again in response to each poll or subscription refresh.  This is very
   similar to the HTTP [<a href="rfc2616.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>] problem of repeated GET operations on a
   resource.  HTTP solves the problem using conditional requests.  The
   server versions each entity with an entity-tag that identifies a
   specific instance of that entity.  Clients making GET requests can
   then include the entity-tag for the version of the entity that they
   believe to be current in an "If-None-Match" header field.  The server
   can compare this entity-tag to the entity it believes to be current
   and suppress resending the entity in the response if the server
   believes the client's version matches.  In other words, the server
   doesn't resend information that the client has already received.

   The SIP PUBLISH [<a href="rfc3903.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication"'>RFC3903</a>] method uses a similar mechanism, where a
   refresh of a publication is done by reference to its assigned entity-
   tag, instead of retransmitting the event state each time the
   publication expiration is extended.

   As a summary, here is the required functionality to solve the
   presented issues:

   REQ1:   It must be possible to suppress the NOTIFY request (or at a
           minimum, the event body therein) if the subscriber is already
           in possession of (or has previously received and discarded)
           the latest event state of the resource.

   REQ2:   This mechanism must apply to initial subscriptions in which
           the subscriber is attempting to resume an earlier
           subscription that has been paused.

   REQ3:   This mechanism must apply to refreshing a subscription.

   REQ4:   This mechanism must apply to terminating a subscription
           (i.e., an unsubscribe).

   REQ5:   This mechanism must apply to fetching or polling of resource
           state.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Overview%20of%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Overview of Operation</span>

   Whenever a subscriber initiates a subscription, it issues a SUBSCRIBE
   request.  The SUBSCRIBE request is sent, routed, and processed by the
   notifier normally, i.e., according to the Session Initiation Protocol
   [<a href="rfc3261.html" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] and SIP-Specific Event Notification [<a href="rfc3265.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification"'>RFC3265</a>].

   If the notifier receiving the SUBSCRIBE request supports conditional
   subscriptions, it generates an entity-tag for the current entity, and
   includes it in a SIP-ETag header field of the NOTIFY request.  The
   entity-tag is unique across all versions of all entities for a
   resource and event package.  See <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> for more on this.

   Entity-tags are independent of subscriptions.  This allows
   notifications generated to a fetch or a poll to have valid entity-
   tags even across subsequent fetches or polls.

   The subscriber will store the entity-tag received in the notification
   along with the resource state.  It can then later use this entity-tag
   to make a SUBSCRIBE contain a condition in the form of a "Suppress-
   If-Match" header field.  Unlike the "If-Match" condition in a PUBLISH
   [<a href="rfc3903.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication"'>RFC3903</a>] request, which applies to whether the PUBLISH succeeds or
   returns an error, this condition applies to the stream of
   notifications that are sent after the SUBSCRIBE request has been
   processed.

   The Suppress-If-Match header field contains the last entity-tag seen
   by the subscriber.  This condition, if true, instructs the notifier
   to suppress either the body of a subsequent notification, or the
   entire notification.

   The condition is evaluated by matching the value of the header field
   against the entity-tag of the entity that would normally be sent in
   the associated NOTIFY message.  There is also a wildcard entity-tag
   with a special value of "*" that always matches.

                      Figure 1: Example Message Flow

   Figure 1 describes a typical message flow for conditional
   notification:

   (1)   The subscriber initiates a subscription by sending a SUBSCRIBE
         request for a resource.

   (2)   After proper authentication and authorization, the notifier
         accepts the subscription.

   (3)   The notifier then immediately sends the initial event
         notification, including a unique entity-tag in a SIP-ETag
         header field.

   (4)   The subscriber accepts the notification and stores the entity-
         tag value along with the resource state.

   (5)   Later, the subscriber refreshes the subscription, and includes
         an entity-tag in a Suppress-If-Match header field.

   (6)   The notifier evaluates the condition by matching its local
         entity-tag value for the resource against the value of the
         Suppress-If-Match header field.  If the condition evaluates to
         true, the notifier informs the subscriber that the notification
         will not be sent.

   (7)   At some point, the state of the resource changes, e.g., the
         presence status of a user changes from online to busy.  This
         triggers an event notification with a new value in the SIP-ETag
         header field.

   (8)   The subscriber accepts the notification and stores the new
         entity-tag along with the resource state.

   (9)   After a while, the subscriber decides to terminate the
         subscription.  It adds a condition for Suppress-If-Match, and
         includes the entity-tag it received in the previous NOTIFY.

   (10)  The notifier evaluates the condition by matching its entity-tag
         for the resource against the value of the Suppress-If-Match
         header field.  If the condition evaluates to true, the notifier
         informs the subscriber that no notification will be sent.  This
         concludes the subscription.

   The benefit of using conditional notification in this example is in
   the reduction of the number of NOTIFY requests the subscriber can
   expect to receive.  Each event notification that the subscriber has
   already seen is suppressed by the notifier.  This example illustrates
   only one use case for the mechanism; the same principles can be used
   to optimize the flow of messages related to other event notification
   use cases.

   The key to understanding how conditional notification works is
   understanding the underlying resource model of event notification.
   In general, this model is similar to the resource model of HTTP with
   some key differences.  This section explains in detail the model as
   it applies to SIP events.  Figure 2 illustrates the model.

   For a given event package, there is a single authoritative agent
   responsible for zero or more resources.  That is, even for a
   distributed agent, the resource state is uniform across all
   instances.  The resource itself can be a list of resources [<a href="rfc4662.html" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists"'>RFC4662</a>].
   Conditional notification for list subscriptions is addressed in
   <a href="#section-6.5">Section 6.5</a>.

   A resource is identified by zero or more URIs, which can be SIP URIs,
   pres URIs [<a href="rfc3859.html" title='"Common Profile for Presence (CPP)"'>RFC3859</a>], or similar.  Subscribers use this URI to
   subscribe to the resource for certain types of events, identified by
   the event package.

   With a successful subscription, a subscriber receives event
   notifications that communicate the resource state and the changes
   thereto.  Each event notification carries a representation of the
   current resource state.  This representation is influenced by many
   factors, e.g., authorization and filtering rules, and the event
   composition rules of the notifier.

   This representation is realized in an "entity".  Each resource may be
   associated with zero or more entities.  For example, there may be
   multiple subscribers to the presence information of a single user (a
   resource), and each subscriber may have a different filtered view of
   that resource, producing one entity per subscriber.  However, each
   entity is associated with one and only one resource; there is no
   "compositing" of resources at the entity level.  Resources may
   themselves be made up of information from other resources (be
   "composite resources"), but this does not change the one-resource-
   per-entity rule.

   An entity consists of the data carried in the body of a NOTIFY
   message and related meta-data in the message header.  Whenever the
   data in the body or any of the meta-data changes, the notifier MUST
   produce a new entity-tag.  This meta-data MUST include, but is not
   limited to the following SIP header fields defined in the Session
   Initiation Protocol [<a href="rfc3261.html" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>] and SIP Specific Event Notification
   [<a href="rfc3265.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification"'>RFC3265</a>]:

      6.  Event

   Note that the Subscription-State is explicitly not part of the
   entity.  In the future, event packages may define additional fields
   that implementations need to consider as part of the entity.

   An entity has one or more versions of which only one is current and
   all others stale.  Each version has an entity-tag, which uniquely
   identifies it across all versions of all entities pertaining to a
   single resource and event package.

   Note that two entity-tags for different resources being equal does
   not indicate identical entities.  In other words, if an entity-tag
   received for a subscription to a first resource matches an entity-tag
   received for a subscription to a second resource, the subscriber
   cannot assume that the two entity values are equal.

   With partial event notification, the NOTIFY message only carries the
   delta state, or the set of changes to the previous version of the
   entity.  In that case, implementations MUST consider the full event
   state as the version of the entity to which the entity-tag in the
   NOTIFY message applies.

   The conditional notification mechanism is independent of the way in
   which subscriptions are installed.  In other words, the mechanism
   supports implicit subscriptions, such as those associated with the
   REFER method [<a href="rfc3515.html" title='"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Refer Method"'>RFC3515</a>].

   It is possible that the same resource is in some shape or form
   accessible through another mechanism in addition to SIP Event
   Notification, e.g., HTTP or the SIP PUBLISH method.  In general,
   implementations MUST NOT expect the entity-tags to be shared between
   the mechanisms, unless event packages or specific applications of SIP
   events explicitly define such dependencies.

   The mechanism defined in this memo is backwards compatible with SIP
   events [<a href="rfc3265.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification"'>RFC3265</a>] in that a notifier supporting this mechanism will
   insert a SIP entity-tag in its NOTIFY requests, and a subscriber that
   understands this mechanism will know how to use it in creating a
   conditional request.

   Unaware subscribers will simply ignore the entity-tag, make requests
   without conditions, and receive the default treatment from the
   notifier.  Unaware notifiers will simply ignore the conditional
   header fields and continue normal operation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Generating%20SUBSCRIBE%20Requests"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Generating SUBSCRIBE Requests</span>

   When creating a conditional SUBSCRIBE request, the subscriber MUST
   include a single conditional header field including an entity-tag in
   the request.  The condition is evaluated by comparing the entity-tag
   of the subscribed resource with the entity-tag carried in the
   conditional header field.  If they match, the condition evaluates to
   true.

   Unlike the condition introduced for the SIP PUBLISH [<a href="rfc3903.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication"'>RFC3903</a>] method,
   these conditions do not apply to the SUBSCRIBE request itself, but to
   the resulting NOTIFY requests.  When true, the condition drives the
   notifier to change its behavior with regard to sending the
   notifications after the SUBSCRIBE.

   This specification defines a new header field called Suppress-If-
   Match.  This header field introduces a condition to the SUBSCRIBE
   request.  If true, it instructs the notifier either to omit the body
   of the resulting NOTIFY message (if the SUBSCRIBE is not sent within
   an existing dialog) or to suppress (i.e., block) the NOTIFY request
   that would otherwise be triggered by the SUBSCRIBE (for an
   established dialog).  In the latter case, the SUBSCRIBE message will
   be answered with a 204 (No Notification) response.  As long as the
   condition remains true, it also instructs the notifier either to
   suppress any subsequent NOTIFY request or, if there are reportable
   changes in the NOTIFY header, e.g., the Subscription-State has
   changed, to suppress the body of any subsequent NOTIFY request.

   If the condition is false, the notifier follows its default behavior.

   If the subscriber receives a 204 (No Notification) response to an in-
   dialog SUBSCRIBE, the subscriber MUST consider the event state and
   the subscription state unchanged.

   The value of the Suppress-If-Match header field is an entity-tag,
   which is an opaque token that the subscriber simply copies (byte-
   wise) from a previously received NOTIFY request.  Inclusion of an
   entity-tag in a Suppress-If-Match header field of a SUBSCRIBE request
   indicates that the client has a copy of, or is capable of recreating
   a copy of, the entity associated with that entity-tag.

   Example:

      Suppress-If-Match: b4cf7

   The header field can also be wildcarded using the special "*" entity-
   tag value.  Such a condition always evaluates to true regardless of
   the value of the current entity-tag for the resource.

   Example:

      Suppress-If-Match: *

   Such a wildcard condition effectively quenches a subscription; the
   only notifications received are those reporting changes to the
   subscription state and those in response to a SUBSCRIBE message sent
   outside of an existing dialog.  In both cases, the notifications will
   not contain a body.

      A subscription with a wildcard Suppress-If-Match condition is
      useful in scenarios where the subscriber wants to temporarily put
      a subscription in dormant mode.  For example, a host may want to
      conserve bandwidth and power when it detects from screen or input
      device inactivity that the user isn't actively monitoring the
      presence statuses of contacts.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.%20%20Receiving%20NOTIFY%20Requests"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" name="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Receiving NOTIFY Requests</span>

   When a subscriber receives a NOTIFY request that contains a SIP-ETag
   header field, it MUST store the entity-tag if it wishes to make use
   of the conditional notification mechanism.  The subscriber MUST be
   prepared to receive a NOTIFY with any entity-tag value, including a
   value that matches any previous value that the subscriber might have
   seen.

   The subscriber MUST NOT infer any meaning from the value of an
   entity-tag; specifically, the subscriber MUST NOT assume identical
   entities (i.e., event state) for NOTIFYs with identical entity-tag
   values when those NOTIFYs result from subscription to different
   resources.

      Note that there are valid cases for which identical entity-tag
      values on different resources may occur.  For example, it is
      possible to generate entity-tag values using a one-way hash
      function, resulting in the possibility that two different
      resources having the same entity-value will also have the same
      entity-tag.  Clients however MUST NOT assume that this is the
      case, as the algorithm for the generation of entity-tags is
      notifier-dependent and not negotiated with the subscriber.
      Consequently, the subscriber cannot differentiate between two
      entity-tags that have the same value because they are similar
      hashes of identical entities, or because two notifiers happen to
      have used the same sequential number as an entity-tag.  Entity
      tags are only required to be unique for a given resource, not
      globally unique.

   (1)  The subscriber polls for resource state by sending a SUBSCRIBE
        with zero expiry (expires immediately).

   (2)  The notifier accepts the SUBSCRIBE with a 202 (Accepted)
        response.

   (3)  The notifier then immediately sends a first (and last) NOTIFY
        request with the current resource state and the current entity-
        tag in the SIP-ETag header field.

   (4)  The subscriber accepts the notification with a 200 (OK)
        response.

   (5)  After some arbitrary poll interval, the subscriber sends another
        SUBSCRIBE with a Suppress-If-Match header field that includes
        the entity-tag received in the previous NOTIFY.

   (6)  The notifier accepts the SUBSCRIBE with a 202 (Accepted)
        response.  (202 would be used to indicate that the subscription
        request was understood without also indicating that it was

        Notification [<a href="rfc3265.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification"'>RFC3265</a>].)

   (7)  Since the resource state has not changed since the previous poll
        occurred, the notifier sends a NOTIFY message with no body.  It
        also mirrors the current entity-tag of the resource in the SIP-
        ETag header field.

   (8)  The subscriber accepts the notification with a 200 (OK)

   Resuming a subscription means the ability to continue an earlier
   subscription that either closed abruptly or was explicitly
   terminated.  When resuming, the subscription is established without
   transmitting the resource state.  This is accomplished with
   conditional notification and the Suppress-If-Match header field:

        including a Suppress-If-Match header field with the entity-tag
        it last received.

        authentication and authorization, by sending a 202 (Accepted)
        response.

   (3)  Since the condition is true, the notifier then immediately sends
        an initial NOTIFY request that has no body.  It also mirrors the
        current entity-tag of the resource in the SIP-ETag header field.

   (4)  The subscriber accepts the NOTIFY and sends a 200 (OK) response.

   Had the entity-tag not been valid any longer, the condition would
   have evaluated to false, and the NOTIFY would have had a body
   containing the latest resource state.

   To refresh a subscription using conditional notification, the
   subscriber creates a subscription refresh before the subscription
   expires, and uses the Suppress-If-Match header field:

                    Figure 5: Refreshing a Subscription

   (1)  Before the subscription expires, the subscriber sends a
        SUBSCRIBE request that includes the Suppress-If-Match header
        field with the latest entity-tag it has seen.

   (2)  If the condition evaluates to true, the notifier sends a 204 (No
        Notification) response and sends no NOTIFY request.  The Expires
        header field of the 204 (No Notification) response indicates the
        new expiry time.

   (2)  If the condition evaluates to true, the notifier sends a 204 (No
        Notification) response, which concludes the subscription, and
        the subscriber can clear all state related to the subscription.

   This section is non-normative.

   In some deployments, there may be Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA)
   devices that track SIP dialogs such as subscription dialogs.  These
   devices may be unaware of the conditional notification mechanism.

   It is possible that some B2BUA devices may treat a NOTIFY with
   suppressed body as an error, or may expect all SUBSCRIBE messages to
   have an associated NOTIFY message.

   In general, there is very little that an endpoint can do to recover
   from such transient errors.  The most that can be done is to try to
   detect such errors, and define a fallback behavior.

   If subscribers encounter transient errors in conditional
   notification, they should disable the feature and fall back to normal
   subscription behavior.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Notifier%20Behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Notifier Behavior</span>

   This section augments the notifier behavior as specified in <a href="rfc3265.html">RFC 3265</a>
   [<a href="rfc3265.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification"'>RFC3265</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1.%20%20Generating%20Entity-tags"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Generating Entity-tags</span>

   An entity-tag is a token carried in the SIP-ETag header field, and it
   is opaque to the client.  The notifier is free to decide on any means
   for generating the entity-tag.  It can have any value, except for
   "*".  For example, one possible method is to implement the entity-tag
   as a simple counter, incrementing it by one for each generated
   notification per resource.

   A notifier MUST generate entity-tags for event notifications of all
   resources for which it is responsible.  The entity-tag MUST be unique
   across all versions of all entities for each state of a resource as
   reported by a given event package.  Otherwise said, for any
   subscription or sequence of subscriptions to a specific resource
   using a singular event package, each entity-tag produced MUST map to
   one and only one presentation of resource state (entity).  Two
   identical entities for a specific resource might or might not have
   identical entity-tags; this decision is left to the notifier.

   An entity-tag is considered valid for as long as the entity exists.
   An entity becomes stale when its version is no longer the current
   one.  The notifier MUST remember (or be able to recalculate) the
   entity-tag of an entity as long as the version of the entity is
   current.  The notifier MAY remember the entity-tag longer than this,
   e.g., for implementing journaled state differentials (<a href="#section-6.4">Section 6.4</a>).

   The entity-tag values used in publications are not necessarily shared
   with the entity-tag values used in subscriptions.  This is because
   there may not always be a one-to-one mapping between a publication
   and a notification of state change; there may be several sources to
   the event composition process, and a publication into a resource may
   not affect the resulting entity.

   When a condition in a SUBSCRIBE request for suppressing notifications
   is true (i.e., the local entity-tag for the resource state and the
   entity-tag in a Suppress-If-Match header field are byte-wise
   identical) but there are reportable changes in the NOTIFY header
   (e.g., the Subscription-State has changed), the notifier MUST
   suppress the body of the NOTIFY request.  That is, the resulting
   NOTIFY contains no Content-Type header field, the Content-Length is
   set to zero, and no payload is attached to the message.

   Additionally, when a condition in a SUBSCRIBE request for suppressing
   notifications is true and the SUBSCRIBE message is not sent within an
   established dialog, the notifier MUST send a NOTIFY request with a
   suppressed entity body.

   Suppressing the entity body of a NOTIFY does not change the current
   entity-tag of the resource.  Hence, the NOTIFY MUST contain a SIP-
   ETag header field that contains the unchanged entity-tag of the
   resource state.

   A Suppress-If-Match header field that includes an entity-tag with the
   value of "*" MUST always evaluate to true.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.3.%20%20Suppressing%20NOTIFY%20Requests"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" name="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Suppressing NOTIFY Requests</span>

   When a condition in a SUBSCRIBE request to suppress notifications is
   true (i.e., the local entity-tag of the resource and the entity-tag
   in a Suppress-If-Match header field match), and the SUBSCRIBE is sent
   within an established dialog, then the notifier MUST suppress the
   resulting NOTIFY request, and generate a 204 (No Notification)
   response.  As long as the condition remains true, and there are no
   reportable changes in the NOTIFY header, all subsequent NOTIFY
   requests MUST also be suppressed.

   Notifiers MUST NOT suppress a NOTIFY unless the corresponding
   SUBSCRIBE message was sent in an established dialog.

   A successful conditional SUBSCRIBE request MUST extend the
   subscription expiry time.

   Suppressing the entire NOTIFY has no effect on the entity-tag of the
   resource.  In other words, it remains unchanged.

   A Suppress-If-Match header field that includes an entity-tag with the
   value of "*" MUST always evaluate to true.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.4.%20%20State%20Differentials"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.4" name="section-6.4">6.4</a>.  State Differentials</span>

   Some event packages support a scheme where notifications contain
   state differentials, or state deltas [<a href="rfc3265.html" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification"'>RFC3265</a>], instead of complete
   resource state.

   Further extensions could define means for notifiers to keep track of
   the state changes of a resource, e.g., storing the changes in a
   journal.  If a condition fails, the notifier would then send a state
   differential in the NOTIFY rather than the full state of the event
   resource.  This is only possible if the event package and the
   subscriber both support a payload format that has this capability.

   When state differentials are sent, the SIP-ETag header field MUST
   contain an entity-tag that corresponds to the full resource state.

   The Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists [<a href="rfc4662.html" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Extension for Resource Lists"'>RFC4662</a>] defines
   a mechanism for subscribing to a homogeneous list of resources using
   the SIP events framework.

   A list subscription delivers event notifications that contain both
   Resource List Meta-Information (RLMI) documents as well as the
   resource state of the individual resources on the list.

   Implementations MUST consider the full resource state of a resource
   list including RLMI and the entity-header as the entity to which the
   entity-tag applies.
