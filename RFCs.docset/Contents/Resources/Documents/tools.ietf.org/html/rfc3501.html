<meta content="The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) allows
a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a
server. IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message
folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders.
IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline client to
resynchronize with the server. IMAP4rev1 includes operations for
creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages,
permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 2822
and RFC 2045 parsing, searching, and selective fetching of message
attributes, texts, and portions thereof. Messages in IMAP4rev1 are
accessed by the use of numbers. These numbers are either message
sequence numbers or unique identifiers. IMAP4rev1 supports a single
server. A mechanism for accessing configuration information to support
multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is discussed in RFC 2244. IMAP4rev1 does
not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a
mail transfer protocol such as RFC 2821. [STANDARDS-TRACK]" name="DC.Description.Abstract"/>

Abstract

   The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1)
   allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on
   a server.  IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote
   message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local
   folders.  IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline
   client to resynchronize with the server.

   IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming
   mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages,
   setting and clearing flags, <a href="rfc2822.html">RFC 2822</a> and <a href="rfc2045.html">RFC 2045</a> parsing, searching,
   and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions
   thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers.
   These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique
   identifiers.

   IMAP4rev1 supports a single server.  A mechanism for accessing
   configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is
   discussed in <a href="rfc2244.html">RFC 2244</a>.

   IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is
   handled by a mail transfer protocol such as <a href="rfc2821.html">RFC 2821</a>.

IMAP4rev1 Protocol Specification

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20%20%20%20%20How%20to%20Read%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.      How to Read This Document</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20%20%20Organization%20of%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.    Organization of This Document</span>

   This document is written from the point of view of the implementor of
   an IMAP4rev1 client or server.  Beyond the protocol overview in
   <a href="#section-2">section 2</a>, it is not optimized for someone trying to understand the
   operation of the protocol.  The material in sections <a href="#section-3">3</a> through <a href="#section-5">5</a>
   provides the general context and definitions with which IMAP4rev1
   operates.

   Sections <a href="#section-6">6</a>, <a href="#section-7">7</a>, and <a href="#section-9">9</a> describe the IMAP commands, responses, and
   syntax, respectively.  The relationships among these are such that it
   is almost impossible to understand any of them separately.  In
   particular, do not attempt to deduce command syntax from the command
   section alone; instead refer to the Formal Syntax section.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.%20%20%20%20Conventions%20Used%20in%20This%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>.    Conventions Used in This Document</span>

   "Conventions" are basic principles or procedures.  Document
   conventions are noted in this section.

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
   be interpreted as described in [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>KEYWORDS</a>].

   The word "can" (not "may") is used to refer to a possible
   circumstance or situation, as opposed to an optional facility of the
   protocol.

   "User" is used to refer to a human user, whereas "client" refers to
   the software being run by the user.

   "Connection" refers to the entire sequence of client/server
   interaction from the initial establishment of the network connection
   until its termination.

   "Session" refers to the sequence of client/server interaction from
   the time that a mailbox is selected (SELECT or EXAMINE command) until
   the time that selection ends (SELECT or EXAMINE of another mailbox,
   CLOSE command, or connection termination).

   Characters are 7-bit US-ASCII unless otherwise specified.  Other
   character sets are indicated using a "CHARSET", as described in
   [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMT" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Two: Media Types"'>MIME-IMT</a>] and defined in [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Character Set Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>].  CHARSETs have important
   additional semantics in addition to defining character set; refer to
   these documents for more detail.

   There are several protocol conventions in IMAP.  These refer to
   aspects of the specification which are not strictly part of the IMAP
   protocol, but reflect generally-accepted practice.  Implementations
   need to be aware of these conventions, and avoid conflicts whether or
   not they implement the convention.  For example, "&amp;" may not be used
   as a hierarchy delimiter since it conflicts with the Mailbox
   International Naming Convention, and other uses of "&amp;" in mailbox
   names are impacted as well.

   Implementors of the IMAP protocol are strongly encouraged to read the
   IMAP implementation recommendations document [<a href="#ref-IMAP-IMPLEMENTATION" title='"IMAP Implementation Recommendations"'>IMAP-IMPLEMENTATION</a>] in
   conjunction with this document, to help understand the intricacies of
   this protocol and how best to build an interoperable product.

   IMAP4rev1 is designed to be upwards compatible from the [<a href="#ref-IMAP2" title='"Interactive Mail Access Protocol - Version 2"'>IMAP2</a>] and
   unpublished IMAP2bis protocols.  IMAP4rev1 is largely compatible with
   the IMAP4 protocol described in <a href="rfc1730.html">RFC 1730</a>; the exception being in
   certain facilities added in <a href="rfc1730.html">RFC 1730</a> that proved problematic and were
   subsequently removed.  In the course of the evolution of IMAP4rev1,
   some aspects in the earlier protocols have become obsolete.  Obsolete
   commands, responses, and data formats which an IMAP4rev1
   implementation can encounter when used with an earlier implementation
   are described in [<a href="#ref-IMAP-OBSOLETE" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol - Obsolete Syntax"'>IMAP-OBSOLETE</a>].

   Other compatibility issues with IMAP2bis, the most common variant of
   the earlier protocol, are discussed in [<a href="#ref-IMAP-COMPAT" title='"IMAP4 Compatibility with IMAP2bis"'>IMAP-COMPAT</a>].  A full
   discussion of compatibility issues with rare (and presumed extinct)

   primarily of historical interest.

   IMAP was originally developed for the older [<a href="rfc822.html" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>RFC-822</a>] standard, and
   as a consequence several fetch items in IMAP incorporate "<a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>" in
   their name.  With the exception of <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>.SIZE, there are more modern
   replacements; for example, the modern version of <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>.HEADER is
   BODY.PEEK[HEADER].  In all cases, "<a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>" should be interpreted as a
   reference to the updated [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] standard.

   The IMAP4rev1 protocol assumes a reliable data stream such as that
   provided by TCP.  When TCP is used, an IMAP4rev1 server listens on
   port 143.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20%20%20Commands%20and%20Responses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.    Commands and Responses</span>

   An IMAP4rev1 connection consists of the establishment of a
   client/server network connection, an initial greeting from the
   server, and client/server interactions.  These client/server
   interactions consist of a client command, server data, and a server
   completion result response.

   All interactions transmitted by client and server are in the form of
   lines, that is, strings that end with a CRLF.  The protocol receiver
   of an IMAP4rev1 client or server is either reading a line, or is
   reading a sequence of octets with a known count followed by a line.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.1.%20%20Client%20Protocol%20Sender%20and%20Server%20Protocol%20Receiver"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.1" name="section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  Client Protocol Sender and Server Protocol Receiver</span>

   The client command begins an operation.  Each client command is
   prefixed with an identifier (typically a short alphanumeric string,
   e.g., A0001, A0002, etc.) called a "tag".  A different tag is
   generated by the client for each command.

   Clients MUST follow the syntax outlined in this specification
   strictly.  It is a syntax error to send a command with missing or
   extraneous spaces or arguments.

   There are two cases in which a line from the client does not
   represent a complete command.  In one case, a command argument is
   quoted with an octet count (see the description of literal in String
   under Data Formats); in the other case, the command arguments require
   server feedback (see the AUTHENTICATE command).  In either case, the




<span class="grey">Crispin                     Standards Track                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

   server sends a command continuation request response if it is ready
   for the octets (if appropriate) and the remainder of the command.
   This response is prefixed with the token "+".

        Note: If instead, the server detected an error in the
        command, it sends a BAD completion response with a tag
        matching the command (as described below) to reject the
        command and prevent the client from sending any more of the
        command.

        It is also possible for the server to send a completion
        response for some other command (if multiple commands are
        in progress), or untagged data.  In either case, the
        command continuation request is still pending; the client
        takes the appropriate action for the response, and reads
        another response from the server.  In all cases, the client
        MUST send a complete command (including receiving all
        command continuation request responses and command
        continuations for the command) before initiating a new
        command.

   The protocol receiver of an IMAP4rev1 server reads a command line
   from the client, parses the command and its arguments, and transmits
   server data and a server command completion result response.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.2.%20%20Server%20Protocol%20Sender%20and%20Client%20Protocol%20Receiver"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2" name="section-2.2.2">2.2.2</a>.  Server Protocol Sender and Client Protocol Receiver</span>

   Data transmitted by the server to the client and status responses
   that do not indicate command completion are prefixed with the token
   "*", and are called untagged responses.

   Server data MAY be sent as a result of a client command, or MAY be
   sent unilaterally by the server.  There is no syntactic difference
   between server data that resulted from a specific command and server
   data that were sent unilaterally.

   The server completion result response indicates the success or
   failure of the operation.  It is tagged with the same tag as the
   client command which began the operation.  Thus, if more than one
   command is in progress, the tag in a server completion response
   identifies the command to which the response applies.  There are
   three possible server completion responses: OK (indicating success),
   NO (indicating failure), or BAD (indicating a protocol error such as
   unrecognized command or command syntax error).

   Servers SHOULD enforce the syntax outlined in this specification
   strictly.  Any client command with a protocol syntax error, including
   (but not limited to) missing or extraneous spaces or arguments,

   SHOULD be rejected, and the client given a BAD server completion
   response.

   The protocol receiver of an IMAP4rev1 client reads a response line
   from the server.  It then takes action on the response based upon the
   first token of the response, which can be a tag, a "*", or a "+".

   A client MUST be prepared to accept any server response at all times.
   This includes server data that was not requested.  Server data SHOULD
   be recorded, so that the client can reference its recorded copy
   rather than sending a command to the server to request the data.  In
   the case of certain server data, the data MUST be recorded.

   This topic is discussed in greater detail in the Server Responses
   section.

   In addition to message text, each message has several attributes
   associated with it.  These attributes can be retrieved individually
   or in conjunction with other attributes or message texts.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.1.%20%20Message%20Numbers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.1" name="section-2.3.1">2.3.1</a>.  Message Numbers</span>

   Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by one of two numbers; the unique
   identifier or the message sequence number.


<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.1.1.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Unique%20Identifier%20%28UID%29%20Message%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.1.1" name="section-2.3.1.1">2.3.1.1</a>.        Unique Identifier (UID) Message Attribute</span>

   A 32-bit value assigned to each message, which when used with the
   unique identifier validity value (see below) forms a 64-bit value
   that MUST NOT refer to any other message in the mailbox or any
   subsequent mailbox with the same name forever.  Unique identifiers
   are assigned in a strictly ascending fashion in the mailbox; as each
   message is added to the mailbox it is assigned a higher UID than the
   message(s) which were added previously.  Unlike message sequence
   numbers, unique identifiers are not necessarily contiguous.

   The unique identifier of a message MUST NOT change during the
   session, and SHOULD NOT change between sessions.  Any change of
   unique identifiers between sessions MUST be detectable using the
   UIDVALIDITY mechanism discussed below.  Persistent unique identifiers
   are required for a client to resynchronize its state from a previous
   session with the server (e.g., disconnected or offline access
   clients); this is discussed further in [<a href="#ref-IMAP-DISC" title='"Synchronization Operations for Disconnected IMAP4 Clients"'>IMAP-DISC</a>].

   Associated with every mailbox are two values which aid in unique
   identifier handling: the next unique identifier value and the unique
   identifier validity value.

   The next unique identifier value is the predicted value that will be
   assigned to a new message in the mailbox.  Unless the unique
   identifier validity also changes (see below), the next unique
   identifier value MUST have the following two characteristics.  First,
   the next unique identifier value MUST NOT change unless new messages
   are added to the mailbox; and second, the next unique identifier
   value MUST change whenever new messages are added to the mailbox,
   even if those new messages are subsequently expunged.

        Note: The next unique identifier value is intended to
        provide a means for a client to determine whether any
        messages have been delivered to the mailbox since the
        previous time it checked this value.  It is not intended to
        provide any guarantee that any message will have this
        unique identifier.  A client can only assume, at the time
        that it obtains the next unique identifier value, that
        messages arriving after that time will have a UID greater
        than or equal to that value.

   The unique identifier validity value is sent in a UIDVALIDITY
   response code in an OK untagged response at mailbox selection time.
   If unique identifiers from an earlier session fail to persist in this
   session, the unique identifier validity value MUST be greater than
   the one used in the earlier session.

        Note: Ideally, unique identifiers SHOULD persist at all
        times.  Although this specification recognizes that failure
        to persist can be unavoidable in certain server
        environments, it STRONGLY ENCOURAGES message store
        implementation techniques that avoid this problem.  For
        example:

         1) Unique identifiers MUST be strictly ascending in the
            mailbox at all times.  If the physical message store is
            re-ordered by a non-IMAP agent, this requires that the
            unique identifiers in the mailbox be regenerated, since
            the former unique identifiers are no longer strictly
            ascending as a result of the re-ordering.

         2) If the message store has no mechanism to store unique
            identifiers, it must regenerate unique identifiers at
            each session, and each session must have a unique
            UIDVALIDITY value.

         3) If the mailbox is deleted and a new mailbox with the
            same name is created at a later date, the server must
            either keep track of unique identifiers from the
            previous instance of the mailbox, or it must assign a
            new UIDVALIDITY value to the new instance of the
            mailbox.  A good UIDVALIDITY value to use in this case
            is a 32-bit representation of the creation date/time of
            the mailbox.  It is alright to use a constant such as
            1, but only if it guaranteed that unique identifiers
            will never be reused, even in the case of a mailbox
            being deleted (or renamed) and a new mailbox by the
            same name created at some future time.

         4) The combination of mailbox name, UIDVALIDITY, and UID
            must refer to a single immutable message on that server
            forever.  In particular, the internal date, [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>]
            size, envelope, body structure, and message texts
            (<a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>, <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>.HEADER, <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>.TEXT, and all BODY[...]
            fetch data items) must never change.  This does not
            include message numbers, nor does it include attributes
            that can be set by a STORE command (e.g., FLAGS).


<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.1.2.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Message%20Sequence%20Number%20Message%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.1.2" name="section-2.3.1.2">2.3.1.2</a>.        Message Sequence Number Message Attribute</span>

   A relative position from 1 to the number of messages in the mailbox.
   This position MUST be ordered by ascending unique identifier.  As
   each new message is added, it is assigned a message sequence number
   that is 1 higher than the number of messages in the mailbox before
   that new message was added.

   Message sequence numbers can be reassigned during the session.  For
   example, when a message is permanently removed (expunged) from the
   mailbox, the message sequence number for all subsequent messages is
   decremented.  The number of messages in the mailbox is also
   decremented.  Similarly, a new message can be assigned a message
   sequence number that was once held by some other message prior to an
   expunge.

   In addition to accessing messages by relative position in the
   mailbox, message sequence numbers can be used in mathematical
   calculations.  For example, if an untagged "11 EXISTS" is received,
   and previously an untagged "8 EXISTS" was received, three new
   messages have arrived with message sequence numbers of 9, 10, and 11.
   Another example, if message 287 in a 523 message mailbox has UID
   12345, there are exactly 286 messages which have lesser UIDs and 236
   messages which have greater UIDs.

   A list of zero or more named tokens associated with the message.  A
   flag is set by its addition to this list, and is cleared by its
   removal.  There are two types of flags in IMAP4rev1.  A flag of
   either type can be permanent or session-only.

   A system flag is a flag name that is pre-defined in this
   specification.  All system flags begin with "\".  Certain system
   flags (\Deleted and \Seen) have special semantics described
   elsewhere.  The currently-defined system flags are:

        \Seen
           Message has been read

        \Answered
           Message has been answered

        \Flagged
           Message is "flagged" for urgent/special attention

        \Deleted
           Message is "deleted" for removal by later EXPUNGE

        \Draft
           Message has not completed composition (marked as a draft).

        \Recent
           Message is "recently" arrived in this mailbox.  This session
           is the first session to have been notified about this
           message; if the session is read-write, subsequent sessions
           will not see \Recent set for this message.  This flag can not
           be altered by the client.

           If it is not possible to determine whether or not this
           session is the first session to be notified about a message,
           then that message SHOULD be considered recent.

           If multiple connections have the same mailbox selected
           simultaneously, it is undefined which of these connections
           will see newly-arrived messages with \Recent set and which
           will see it without \Recent set.

   A keyword is defined by the server implementation.  Keywords do not
   begin with "\".  Servers MAY permit the client to define new keywords
   in the mailbox (see the description of the PERMANENTFLAGS response
   code for more information).

   A flag can be permanent or session-only on a per-flag basis.
   Permanent flags are those which the client can add or remove from the
   message flags permanently; that is, concurrent and subsequent
   sessions will see any change in permanent flags.  Changes to session
   flags are valid only in that session.

        Note: The \Recent system flag is a special case of a
        session flag.  \Recent can not be used as an argument in a
        STORE or APPEND command, and thus can not be changed at
        all.

   The internal date and time of the message on the server.  This

   date and time of final delivery of the message as defined by
   [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>].  In the case of messages delivered by the IMAP4rev1 COPY
   command, this SHOULD be the internal date and time of the source
   message.  In the case of messages delivered by the IMAP4rev1
   APPEND command, this SHOULD be the date and time as specified in
   the APPEND command description.  All other cases are
   implementation defined.

   In addition to being able to fetch the full [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] text of a
   message, IMAP4rev1 permits the fetching of portions of the full
   message text.  Specifically, it is possible to fetch the
   [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] message header, [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] message body, a [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>]

   Once the connection between client and server is established, an
   IMAP4rev1 connection is in one of four states.  The initial
   state is identified in the server greeting.  Most commands are
   only valid in certain states.  It is a protocol error for the
   client to attempt a command while the connection is in an
   inappropriate state, and the server will respond with a BAD or
   NO (depending upon server implementation) command completion
   result.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20%20%20Not%20Authenticated%20State"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.    Not Authenticated State</span>

   In the not authenticated state, the client MUST supply
   authentication credentials before most commands will be
   permitted.  This state is entered when a connection starts
   unless the connection has been pre-authenticated.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20%20%20Authenticated%20State"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.    Authenticated State</span>

   In the authenticated state, the client is authenticated and MUST
   select a mailbox to access before commands that affect messages
   will be permitted.  This state is entered when a
   pre-authenticated connection starts, when acceptable
   authentication credentials have been provided, after an error in
   selecting a mailbox, or after a successful CLOSE command.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20%20%20Selected%20State"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.    Selected State</span>

   In a selected state, a mailbox has been selected to access.
   This state is entered when a mailbox has been successfully
   selected.

   In the logout state, the connection is being terminated.  This
   state can be entered as a result of a client request (via the
   LOGOUT command) or by unilateral action on the part of either
   the client or server.

   If the client requests the logout state, the server MUST send an
   untagged BYE response and a tagged OK response to the LOGOUT
   command before the server closes the connection; and the client
   MUST read the tagged OK response to the LOGOUT command before
   the client closes the connection.

   A server MUST NOT unilaterally close the connection without
   sending an untagged BYE response that contains the reason for
   having done so.  A client SHOULD NOT unilaterally close the
   connection, and instead SHOULD issue a LOGOUT command.  If the
   server detects that the client has unilaterally closed the
   connection, the server MAY omit the untagged BYE response and
   simply close its connection.

   IMAP4rev1 uses textual commands and responses.  Data in
   IMAP4rev1 can be in one of several forms: atom, number, string,
   parenthesized list, or NIL.  Note that a particular data item
   may take more than one form; for example, a data item defined as
   using "astring" syntax may be either an atom or a string.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20%20%20Atom"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.    Atom</span>

   An atom consists of one or more non-special characters.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20%20%20Number"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.    Number</span>

   A number consists of one or more digit characters, and
   represents a numeric value.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20%20%20String"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.    String</span>

   A string is in one of two forms: either literal or quoted
   string.  The literal form is the general form of string.  The
   quoted string form is an alternative that avoids the overhead of
   processing a literal at the cost of limitations of characters
   which may be used.

   A literal is a sequence of zero or more octets (including CR and
   LF), prefix-quoted with an octet count in the form of an open
   brace ("{"), the number of octets, close brace ("}"), and CRLF.
   In the case of literals transmitted from server to client, the
   CRLF is immediately followed by the octet data.  In the case of
   literals transmitted from client to server, the client MUST wait
   to receive a command continuation request (described later in
   this document) before sending the octet data (and the remainder
   of the command).

   A quoted string is a sequence of zero or more 7-bit characters,
   excluding CR and LF, with double quote (&lt;"&gt;) characters at each
   end.

   The empty string is represented as either "" (a quoted string
   with zero characters between double quotes) or as {0} followed
   by CRLF (a literal with an octet count of 0).

     Note: Even if the octet count is 0, a client transmitting a
     literal MUST wait to receive a command continuation request.

   8-bit textual and binary mail is supported through the use of a
   [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>] content transfer encoding.  IMAP4rev1 implementations MAY
   transmit 8-bit or multi-octet characters in literals, but SHOULD do
   so only when the [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Character Set Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>] is identified.

   Although a BINARY body encoding is defined, unencoded binary strings
   are not permitted.  A "binary string" is any string with NUL
   characters.  Implementations MUST encode binary data into a textual
   form, such as BASE64, before transmitting the data.  A string with an
   excessive amount of CTL characters MAY also be considered to be
   binary.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20%20%20Parenthesized%20List"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.    Parenthesized List</span>

   Data structures are represented as a "parenthesized list"; a sequence
   of data items, delimited by space, and bounded at each end by
   parentheses.  A parenthesized list can contain other parenthesized
   lists, using multiple levels of parentheses to indicate nesting.

   The empty list is represented as () -- a parenthesized list with no
   members.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.5.%20%20%20%20NIL"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5" name="section-4.5">4.5</a>.    NIL</span>

   The special form "NIL" represents the non-existence of a particular
   data item that is represented as a string or parenthesized list, as
   distinct from the empty string "" or the empty parenthesized list ().

        Note: NIL is never used for any data item which takes the
        form of an atom.  For example, a mailbox name of "NIL" is a
        mailbox named NIL as opposed to a non-existent mailbox
        name.  This is because mailbox uses "astring" syntax which
        is an atom or a string.  Conversely, an addr-name of NIL is
        a non-existent personal name, because addr-name uses
        "nstring" syntax which is NIL or a string, but never an
        atom.

   The following rules are listed here to ensure that all IMAP4rev1
   implementations interoperate properly.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20%20%20Mailbox%20Naming"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.    Mailbox Naming</span>

   Mailbox names are 7-bit.  Client implementations MUST NOT attempt to
   create 8-bit mailbox names, and SHOULD interpret any 8-bit mailbox
   names returned by LIST or LSUB as UTF-8.  Server implementations
   SHOULD prohibit the creation of 8-bit mailbox names, and SHOULD NOT
   return 8-bit mailbox names in LIST or LSUB.  See <a href="#section-5.1.3">section 5.1.3</a> for
   more information on how to represent non-ASCII mailbox names.

        Note: 8-bit mailbox names were undefined in earlier
        versions of this protocol.  Some sites used a local 8-bit
        character set to represent non-ASCII mailbox names.  Such
        usage is not interoperable, and is now formally deprecated.

   The case-insensitive mailbox name INBOX is a special name reserved to
   mean "the primary mailbox for this user on this server".  The
   interpretation of all other names is implementation-dependent.

   In particular, this specification takes no position on case
   sensitivity in non-INBOX mailbox names.  Some server implementations
   are fully case-sensitive; others preserve case of a newly-created
   name but otherwise are case-insensitive; and yet others coerce names
   to a particular case.  Client implementations MUST interact with any
   of these.  If a server implementation interprets non-INBOX mailbox
   names as case-insensitive, it MUST treat names using the
   international naming convention specially as described in <a href="#section-5.1.3">section</a>
   <a href="#section-5.1.3">5.1.3</a>.

   There are certain client considerations when creating a new mailbox
   name:

   1)    Any character which is one of the atom-specials (see the Formal
         Syntax) will require that the mailbox name be represented as a
         quoted string or literal.

   2)    CTL and other non-graphic characters are difficult to represent
         in a user interface and are best avoided.

   3)    Although the list-wildcard characters ("%" and "*") are valid
         in a mailbox name, it is difficult to use such mailbox names
         with the LIST and LSUB commands due to the conflict with
         wildcard interpretation.

   4)    Usually, a character (determined by the server implementation)
         is reserved to delimit levels of hierarchy.

   5)    Two characters, "#" and "&amp;", have meanings by convention, and
         should be avoided except when used in that convention.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.1.%20%20Mailbox%20Hierarchy%20Naming"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.1" name="section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a>.  Mailbox Hierarchy Naming</span>

   If it is desired to export hierarchical mailbox names, mailbox names
   MUST be left-to-right hierarchical using a single character to
   separate levels of hierarchy.  The same hierarchy separator character
   is used for all levels of hierarchy within a single name.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.2.%20%20Mailbox%20Namespace%20Naming%20Convention"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.2" name="section-5.1.2">5.1.2</a>.  Mailbox Namespace Naming Convention</span>

   By convention, the first hierarchical element of any mailbox name
   which begins with "#" identifies the "namespace" of the remainder of
   the name.  This makes it possible to disambiguate between different
   types of mailbox stores, each of which have their own namespaces.

        For example, implementations which offer access to USENET
        newsgroups MAY use the "#news" namespace to partition the
        USENET newsgroup namespace from that of other mailboxes.
        Thus, the comp.mail.misc newsgroup would have a mailbox
        name of "#news.comp.mail.misc", and the name
        "comp.mail.misc" can refer to a different object (e.g., a
        user's private mailbox).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.3.%20%20Mailbox%20International%20Naming%20Convention"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.3" name="section-5.1.3">5.1.3</a>.  Mailbox International Naming Convention</span>

   By convention, international mailbox names in IMAP4rev1 are specified
   using a modified version of the UTF-7 encoding described in [<a href="#ref-UTF-7" title='"UTF-7: A Mail-Safe Transformation Format of Unicode"'>UTF-7</a>].
   Modified UTF-7 may also be usable in servers that implement an
   earlier version of this protocol.

   In modified UTF-7, printable US-ASCII characters, except for "&amp;",
   represent themselves; that is, characters with octet values 0x20-0x25
   and 0x27-0x7e.  The character "&amp;" (0x26) is represented by the
   two-octet sequence "&amp;-".

   All other characters (octet values 0x00-0x1f and 0x7f-0xff) are
   represented in modified BASE64, with a further modification from
   [<a href="#ref-UTF-7" title='"UTF-7: A Mail-Safe Transformation Format of Unicode"'>UTF-7</a>] that "," is used instead of "/".  Modified BASE64 MUST NOT be
   used to represent any printing US-ASCII character which can represent
   itself.






<span class="grey">Crispin                     Standards Track                    [Page 19]</span></pre>

   "&amp;" is used to shift to modified BASE64 and "-" to shift back to
   US-ASCII.  There is no implicit shift from BASE64 to US-ASCII, and
   null shifts ("-&amp;" while in BASE64; note that "&amp;-" while in US-ASCII
   means "&amp;") are not permitted.  However, all names start in US-ASCII,
   and MUST end in US-ASCII; that is, a name that ends with a non-ASCII
   ISO-10646 character MUST end with a "-").

   The purpose of these modifications is to correct the following
   problems with UTF-7:

      1) UTF-7 uses the "+" character for shifting; this conflicts with
         the common use of "+" in mailbox names, in particular USENET
         newsgroup names.

      2) UTF-7's encoding is BASE64 which uses the "/" character; this
         conflicts with the use of "/" as a popular hierarchy delimiter.

      3) UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of "\"; this conflicts with
         the use of "\" as a popular hierarchy delimiter.

      4) UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of "~"; this conflicts with
         the use of "~" in some servers as a home directory indicator.

      5) UTF-7 permits multiple alternate forms to represent the same
         string; in particular, printable US-ASCII characters can be
         represented in encoded form.

      Although modified UTF-7 is a convention, it establishes certain
      requirements on server handling of any mailbox name with an
      embedded "&amp;" character.  In particular, server implementations
      MUST preserve the exact form of the modified BASE64 portion of a
      modified UTF-7 name and treat that text as case-sensitive, even if
      names are otherwise case-insensitive or case-folded.

      Server implementations SHOULD verify that any mailbox name with an
      embedded "&amp;" character, used as an argument to CREATE, is: in the
      correctly modified UTF-7 syntax, has no superfluous shifts, and
      has no encoding in modified BASE64 of any printing US-ASCII
      character which can represent itself.  However, client
      implementations MUST NOT depend upon the server doing this, and
      SHOULD NOT attempt to create a mailbox name with an embedded "&amp;"
      character unless it complies with the modified UTF-7 syntax.

      Server implementations which export a mail store that does not
      follow the modified UTF-7 convention MUST convert to modified
      UTF-7 any mailbox name that contains either non-ASCII characters
      or the "&amp;" character.

           For example, here is a mailbox name which mixes English,
           Chinese, and Japanese text:
           ~peter/mail/&amp;U,BTFw-/&amp;ZeVnLIqe-

           For example, the string "&amp;Jjo!" is not a valid mailbox
           name because it does not contain a shift to US-ASCII
           before the "!".  The correct form is "&amp;Jjo-!".  The
           string "&amp;U,BTFw-&amp;ZeVnLIqe-" is not permitted because it
           contains a superfluous shift.  The correct form is
           "&amp;U,BTF2XlZyyKng-".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20%20%20Mailbox%20Size%20and%20Message%20Status%20Updates"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.    Mailbox Size and Message Status Updates</span>

   At any time, a server can send data that the client did not request.
   Sometimes, such behavior is REQUIRED.  For example, agents other than
   the server MAY add messages to the mailbox (e.g., new message
   delivery), change the flags of the messages in the mailbox (e.g.,
   simultaneous access to the same mailbox by multiple agents), or even
   remove messages from the mailbox.  A server MUST send mailbox size
   updates automatically if a mailbox size change is observed during the
   processing of a command.  A server SHOULD send message flag updates
   automatically, without requiring the client to request such updates
   explicitly.

   Special rules exist for server notification of a client about the
   removal of messages to prevent synchronization errors; see the
   description of the EXPUNGE response for more detail.  In particular,
   it is NOT permitted to send an EXISTS response that would reduce the
   number of messages in the mailbox; only the EXPUNGE response can do
   this.

   Regardless of what implementation decisions a client makes on
   remembering data from the server, a client implementation MUST record
   mailbox size updates.  It MUST NOT assume that any command after the
   initial mailbox selection will return the size of the mailbox.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.%20%20%20%20Response%20when%20no%20Command%20in%20Progress"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" name="section-5.3">5.3</a>.    Response when no Command in Progress</span>

   Server implementations are permitted to send an untagged response
   (except for EXPUNGE) while there is no command in progress.  Server
   implementations that send such responses MUST deal with flow control
   considerations.  Specifically, they MUST either (1) verify that the
   size of the data does not exceed the underlying transport's available
   window size, or (2) use non-blocking writes.

   If a server has an inactivity autologout timer, the duration of that
   timer MUST be at least 30 minutes.  The receipt of ANY command from
   the client during that interval SHOULD suffice to reset the
   autologout timer.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.5.%20%20%20%20Multiple%20Commands%20in%20Progress"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.5" name="section-5.5">5.5</a>.    Multiple Commands in Progress</span>

   The client MAY send another command without waiting for the
   completion result response of a command, subject to ambiguity rules
   (see below) and flow control constraints on the underlying data
   stream.  Similarly, a server MAY begin processing another command
   before processing the current command to completion, subject to
   ambiguity rules.  However, any command continuation request responses
   and command continuations MUST be negotiated before any subsequent
   command is initiated.

   The exception is if an ambiguity would result because of a command
   that would affect the results of other commands.  Clients MUST NOT
   send multiple commands without waiting if an ambiguity would result.
   If the server detects a possible ambiguity, it MUST execute commands
   to completion in the order given by the client.

   The most obvious example of ambiguity is when a command would affect
   the results of another command, e.g., a FETCH of a message's flags
   and a STORE of that same message's flags.

   A non-obvious ambiguity occurs with commands that permit an untagged
   EXPUNGE response (commands other than FETCH, STORE, and SEARCH),
   since an untagged EXPUNGE response can invalidate sequence numbers in
   a subsequent command.  This is not a problem for FETCH, STORE, or
   SEARCH commands because servers are prohibited from sending EXPUNGE
   responses while any of those commands are in progress.  Therefore, if
   the client sends any command other than FETCH, STORE, or SEARCH, it
   MUST wait for the completion result response before sending a command
   with message sequence numbers.

        Note: UID FETCH, UID STORE, and UID SEARCH are different
        commands from FETCH, STORE, and SEARCH.  If the client
        sends a UID command, it must wait for a completion result
        response before sending a command with message sequence
        numbers.

   For example, the following non-waiting command sequences are invalid:

   The following are examples of valid non-waiting command sequences:

   IMAP4rev1 commands are described in this section.  Commands are
   organized by the state in which the command is permitted.  Commands
   which are permitted in multiple states are listed in the minimum
   permitted state (for example, commands valid in authenticated and
   selected state are listed in the authenticated state commands).

   Command arguments, identified by "Arguments:" in the command
   descriptions below, are described by function, not by syntax.  The
   precise syntax of command arguments is described in the Formal Syntax
   section.

   Some commands cause specific server responses to be returned; these
   are identified by "Responses:" in the command descriptions below.
   See the response descriptions in the Responses section for
   information on these responses, and the Formal Syntax section for the
   precise syntax of these responses.  It is possible for server data to
   be transmitted as a result of any command.  Thus, commands that do
   not specifically require server data specify "no specific responses
   for this command" instead of "none".

   The "Result:" in the command description refers to the possible
   tagged status responses to a command, and any special interpretation
   of these status responses.

   The state of a connection is only changed by successful commands
   which are documented as changing state.  A rejected command (BAD
   response) never changes the state of the connection or of the
   selected mailbox.  A failed command (NO response) generally does not
   change the state of the connection or of the selected mailbox; the
   exception being the SELECT and EXAMINE commands.

   Responses:  REQUIRED untagged response: CAPABILITY

   Result:     OK - capability completed
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The CAPABILITY command requests a listing of capabilities that the
      server supports.  The server MUST send a single untagged
      CAPABILITY response with "IMAP4rev1" as one of the listed
      capabilities before the (tagged) OK response.

      A capability name which begins with "AUTH=" indicates that the
      server supports that particular authentication mechanism.  All
      such names are, by definition, part of this specification.  For
      example, the authorization capability for an experimental
      "blurdybloop" authenticator would be "AUTH=XBLURDYBLOOP" and not
      "XAUTH=BLURDYBLOOP" or "XAUTH=XBLURDYBLOOP".

      Other capability names refer to extensions, revisions, or
      amendments to this specification.  See the documentation of the
      CAPABILITY response for additional information.  No capabilities,
      beyond the base IMAP4rev1 set defined in this specification, are
      enabled without explicit client action to invoke the capability.

      Client and server implementations MUST implement the STARTTLS,
      LOGINDISABLED, and AUTH=PLAIN (described in [<a href="#ref-IMAP-TLS" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>IMAP-TLS</a>])
      capabilities.  See the Security Considerations section for
      important information.

      See the section entitled "Client Commands -
      Experimental/Expansion" for information about the form of site or

      The NOOP command always succeeds.  It does nothing.

      Since any command can return a status update as untagged data, the
      NOOP command can be used as a periodic poll for new messages or
      message status updates during a period of inactivity (this is the
      preferred method to do this).  The NOOP command can also be used
      to reset any inactivity autologout timer on the server.

      The LOGOUT command informs the server that the client is done with
      the connection.  The server MUST send a BYE untagged response
      before the (tagged) OK response, and then close the network
      connection.

   In the not authenticated state, the AUTHENTICATE or LOGIN command
   establishes authentication and enters the authenticated state.  The
   AUTHENTICATE command provides a general mechanism for a variety of
   authentication techniques, privacy protection, and integrity
   checking; whereas the LOGIN command uses a traditional user name and
   plaintext password pair and has no means of establishing privacy
   protection or integrity checking.

   The STARTTLS command is an alternate form of establishing session
   privacy protection and integrity checking, but does not establish
   authentication or enter the authenticated state.

   Server implementations MAY allow access to certain mailboxes without
   establishing authentication.  This can be done by means of the
   ANONYMOUS [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] authenticator described in [<a href="#ref-ANONYMOUS" title='"Anonymous SASL Mechanism"'>ANONYMOUS</a>].  An older
   convention is a LOGIN command using the userid "anonymous"; in this
   case, a password is required although the server may choose to accept
   any password.  The restrictions placed on anonymous users are
   implementation-dependent.

   Once authenticated (including as anonymous), it is not possible to
   re-enter not authenticated state.

   In addition to the universal commands (CAPABILITY, NOOP, and LOGOUT),
   the following commands are valid in the not authenticated state:
   STARTTLS, AUTHENTICATE and LOGIN.  See the Security Considerations
   section for important information about these commands.

   Arguments:  none

   Responses:  no specific response for this command

   Result:     OK - starttls completed, begin TLS negotiation
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      A [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] negotiation begins immediately after the CRLF at the end
      of the tagged OK response from the server.  Once a client issues a
      STARTTLS command, it MUST NOT issue further commands until a
      server response is seen and the [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] negotiation is complete.

      The server remains in the non-authenticated state, even if client
      credentials are supplied during the [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] negotiation.  This does
      not preclude an authentication mechanism such as EXTERNAL (defined
      in [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>]) from using client identity determined by the [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>]
      negotiation.

      Once [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] has been started, the client MUST discard cached
      information about server capabilities and SHOULD re-issue the
      CAPABILITY command.  This is necessary to protect against man-in-
      the-middle attacks which alter the capabilities list prior to
      STARTTLS.  The server MAY advertise different capabilities after
      STARTTLS.

   Example:    C: a001 CAPABILITY
               S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 STARTTLS LOGINDISABLED

   Arguments:  authentication mechanism name

   Responses:  continuation data can be requested

   Result:     OK - authenticate completed, now in authenticated state
               NO - authenticate failure: unsupported authentication
                    mechanism, credentials rejected
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid,
                    authentication exchange cancelled

      The AUTHENTICATE command indicates a [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] authentication
      mechanism to the server.  If the server supports the requested
      authentication mechanism, it performs an authentication protocol
      exchange to authenticate and identify the client.  It MAY also
      negotiate an OPTIONAL security layer for subsequent protocol
      interactions.  If the requested authentication mechanism is not
      supported, the server SHOULD reject the AUTHENTICATE command by
      sending a tagged NO response.

      The AUTHENTICATE command does not support the optional "initial
      response" feature of [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>].  Section 5.1 of [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] specifies how
      to handle an authentication mechanism which uses an initial
      response.

      The service name specified by this protocol's profile of [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] is
      "imap".

      The authentication protocol exchange consists of a series of
      server challenges and client responses that are specific to the
      authentication mechanism.  A server challenge consists of a
      command continuation request response with the "+" token followed
      by a BASE64 encoded string.  The client response consists of a
      single line consisting of a BASE64 encoded string.  If the client
      wishes to cancel an authentication exchange, it issues a line
      consisting of a single "*".  If the server receives such a
      response, it MUST reject the AUTHENTICATE command by sending a
      tagged BAD response.

      If a security layer is negotiated through the [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>]
      authentication exchange, it takes effect immediately following the
      CRLF that concludes the authentication exchange for the client,
      and the CRLF of the tagged OK response for the server.

      While client and server implementations MUST implement the
      AUTHENTICATE command itself, it is not required to implement any
      authentication mechanisms other than the PLAIN mechanism described

      in [<a href="#ref-IMAP-TLS" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>IMAP-TLS</a>].  Also, an authentication mechanism is not required
      to support any security layers.

           Note: a server implementation MUST implement a
           configuration in which it does NOT permit any plaintext
           password mechanisms, unless either the STARTTLS command
           has been negotiated or some other mechanism that
           protects the session from password snooping has been
           provided.  Server sites SHOULD NOT use any configuration
           which permits a plaintext password mechanism without
           such a protection mechanism against password snooping.
           Client and server implementations SHOULD implement
           additional [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] mechanisms that do not use plaintext
           passwords, such the GSSAPI mechanism described in [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>]
           and/or the [<a href="#ref-DIGEST-MD5" title='"Using Digest Authentication as a SASL Mechanism"'>DIGEST-MD5</a>] mechanism.

      Servers and clients can support multiple authentication
      mechanisms.  The server SHOULD list its supported authentication
      mechanisms in the response to the CAPABILITY command so that the
      client knows which authentication mechanisms to use.

      A server MAY include a CAPABILITY response code in the tagged OK
      response of a successful AUTHENTICATE command in order to send
      capabilities automatically.  It is unnecessary for a client to
      send a separate CAPABILITY command if it recognizes these
      automatic capabilities.  This should only be done if a security
      layer was not negotiated by the AUTHENTICATE command, because the
      tagged OK response as part of an AUTHENTICATE command is not
      protected by encryption/integrity checking.  [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] requires the
      client to re-issue a CAPABILITY command in this case.

      If an AUTHENTICATE command fails with a NO response, the client
      MAY try another authentication mechanism by issuing another
      AUTHENTICATE command.  It MAY also attempt to authenticate by
      using the LOGIN command (see <a href="#section-6.2.3">section 6.2.3</a> for more detail).  In
      other words, the client MAY request authentication types in
      decreasing order of preference, with the LOGIN command as a last
      resort.

      The authorization identity passed from the client to the server
      during the authentication exchange is interpreted by the server as
      the user name whose privileges the client is requesting.

      A server MAY include a CAPABILITY response code in the tagged OK
      response to a successful LOGIN command in order to send

   Example:    C: a001 LOGIN SMITH SESAME
               S: a001 OK LOGIN completed

        Note: Use of the LOGIN command over an insecure network
        (such as the Internet) is a security risk, because anyone
        monitoring network traffic can obtain plaintext passwords.
        The LOGIN command SHOULD NOT be used except as a last
        resort, and it is recommended that client implementations
        have a means to disable any automatic use of the LOGIN
        command.

        Unless either the STARTTLS command has been negotiated or
        some other mechanism that protects the session from
        password snooping has been provided, a server
        implementation MUST implement a configuration in which it
        advertises the LOGINDISABLED capability and does NOT permit
        the LOGIN command.  Server sites SHOULD NOT use any
        configuration which permits the LOGIN command without such
        a protection mechanism against password snooping.  A client
        implementation MUST NOT send a LOGIN command if the
        LOGINDISABLED capability is advertised.

      The SELECT command selects a mailbox so that messages in the
      mailbox can be accessed.  Before returning an OK to the client,
      the server MUST send the following untagged data to the client.
      Note that earlier versions of this protocol only required the
      FLAGS, EXISTS, and RECENT untagged data; consequently, client
      implementations SHOULD implement default behavior for missing data
      as discussed with the individual item.

         FLAGS       Defined flags in the mailbox.  See the description
                     of the FLAGS response for more detail.

         &lt;n&gt; EXISTS  The number of messages in the mailbox.  See the
                     description of the EXISTS response for more detail.

         &lt;n&gt; RECENT  The number of messages with the \Recent flag set.
                     See the description of the RECENT response for more
                     detail.

         OK [UNSEEN &lt;n&gt;]
                     The message sequence number of the first unseen
                     message in the mailbox.  If this is missing, the
                     client can not make any assumptions about the first
                     unseen message in the mailbox, and needs to issue a
                     SEARCH command if it wants to find it.

         OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (&lt;list of flags&gt;)]
                     A list of message flags that the client can change
                     permanently.  If this is missing, the client should
                     assume that all flags can be changed permanently.

         OK [UIDNEXT &lt;n&gt;]
                     The next unique identifier value.  Refer to <a href="#section-2.3.1.1">section</a>
                     <a href="#section-2.3.1.1">2.3.1.1</a> for more information.  If this is missing,
                     the client can not make any assumptions about the
                     next unique identifier value.

         OK [UIDVALIDITY &lt;n&gt;]
                     The unique identifier validity value.  Refer to
                     <a href="#section-2.3.1.1">section 2.3.1.1</a> for more information.  If this is
                     missing, the server does not support unique
                     identifiers.

      Only one mailbox can be selected at a time in a connection;
      simultaneous access to multiple mailboxes requires multiple
      connections.  The SELECT command automatically deselects any
      currently selected mailbox before attempting the new selection.
      Consequently, if a mailbox is selected and a SELECT command that
      fails is attempted, no mailbox is selected.

      If the client is permitted to modify the mailbox, the server
      SHOULD prefix the text of the tagged OK response with the
      "[READ-WRITE]" response code.

      If the client is not permitted to modify the mailbox but is
      permitted read access, the mailbox is selected as read-only, and
      the server MUST prefix the text of the tagged OK response to
      SELECT with the "[READ-ONLY]" response code.  Read-only access
      through SELECT differs from the EXAMINE command in that certain
      read-only mailboxes MAY permit the change of permanent state on a
      per-user (as opposed to global) basis.  Netnews messages marked in
      a server-based .newsrc file are an example of such per-user
      permanent state that can be modified with read-only mailboxes.

   Example:    C: A142 SELECT INBOX
               S: * 172 EXISTS
               S: * 1 RECENT

      The EXAMINE command is identical to SELECT and returns the same

      No changes to the permanent state of the mailbox, including
      per-user state, are permitted; in particular, EXAMINE MUST NOT

      The CREATE command creates a mailbox with the given name.  An OK
      response is returned only if a new mailbox with that name has been
      created.  It is an error to attempt to create INBOX or a mailbox
      with a name that refers to an extant mailbox.  Any error in
      creation will return a tagged NO response.

      If the mailbox name is suffixed with the server's hierarchy
      separator character (as returned from the server by a LIST
      command), this is a declaration that the client intends to create
      mailbox names under this name in the hierarchy.  Server
      implementations that do not require this declaration MUST ignore
      the declaration.  In any case, the name created is without the
      trailing hierarchy delimiter.

      If the server's hierarchy separator character appears elsewhere in
      the name, the server SHOULD create any superior hierarchical names
      that are needed for the CREATE command to be successfully
      completed.  In other words, an attempt to create "foo/bar/zap" on
      a server in which "/" is the hierarchy separator character SHOULD
      create foo/ and foo/bar/ if they do not already exist.

      If a new mailbox is created with the same name as a mailbox which
      was deleted, its unique identifiers MUST be greater than any
      unique identifiers used in the previous incarnation of the mailbox
      UNLESS the new incarnation has a different unique identifier
      validity value.  See the description of the UID command for more
      detail.

   Example:    C: A003 CREATE owatagusiam/
               S: A003 OK CREATE completed
               C: A004 CREATE owatagusiam/blurdybloop
               S: A004 OK CREATE completed

        Note: The interpretation of this example depends on whether
        "/" was returned as the hierarchy separator from LIST.  If
        "/" is the hierarchy separator, a new level of hierarchy
        named "owatagusiam" with a member called "blurdybloop" is
        created.  Otherwise, two mailboxes at the same hierarchy
        level are created.

      The DELETE command permanently removes the mailbox with the given
      name.  A tagged OK response is returned only if the mailbox has
      been deleted.  It is an error to attempt to delete INBOX or a
      mailbox name that does not exist.

      The DELETE command MUST NOT remove inferior hierarchical names.
      For example, if a mailbox "foo" has an inferior "foo.bar"
      (assuming "." is the hierarchy delimiter character), removing
      "foo" MUST NOT remove "foo.bar".  It is an error to attempt to
      delete a name that has inferior hierarchical names and also has
      the \Noselect mailbox name attribute (see the description of the
      LIST response for more details).

      It is permitted to delete a name that has inferior hierarchical
      names and does not have the \Noselect mailbox name attribute.  In
      this case, all messages in that mailbox are removed, and the name
      will acquire the \Noselect mailbox name attribute.

      The value of the highest-used unique identifier of the deleted
      mailbox MUST be preserved so that a new mailbox created with the
      same name will not reuse the identifiers of the former
      incarnation, UNLESS the new incarnation has a different unique
      identifier validity value.  See the description of the UID command
      for more detail.

               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The RENAME command changes the name of a mailbox.  A tagged OK
      response is returned only if the mailbox has been renamed.  It is
      an error to attempt to rename from a mailbox name that does not
      exist or to a mailbox name that already exists.  Any error in
      renaming will return a tagged NO response.

      If the name has inferior hierarchical names, then the inferior
      hierarchical names MUST also be renamed.  For example, a rename of
      "foo" to "zap" will rename "foo/bar" (assuming "/" is the
      hierarchy delimiter character) to "zap/bar".

      If the server's hierarchy separator character appears in the name,
      the server SHOULD create any superior hierarchical names that are
      needed for the RENAME command to complete successfully.  In other
      words, an attempt to rename "foo/bar/zap" to baz/rag/zowie on a
      server in which "/" is the hierarchy separator character SHOULD
      create baz/ and baz/rag/ if they do not already exist.

      The value of the highest-used unique identifier of the old mailbox

      Renaming INBOX is permitted, and has special behavior.  It moves
      all messages in INBOX to a new mailbox with the given name,
      leaving INBOX empty.  If the server implementation supports
      inferior hierarchical names of INBOX, these are unaffected by a
      rename of INBOX.

      The SUBSCRIBE command adds the specified mailbox name to the
      server's set of "active" or "subscribed" mailboxes as returned by
      the LSUB command.  This command returns a tagged OK response only
      if the subscription is successful.

      A server MAY validate the mailbox argument to SUBSCRIBE to verify
      that it exists.  However, it MUST NOT unilaterally remove an
      existing mailbox name from the subscription list even if a mailbox
      by that name no longer exists.

           Note: This requirement is because a server site can
           choose to routinely remove a mailbox with a well-known
           name (e.g., "system-alerts") after its contents expire,
           with the intention of recreating it when new contents
           are appropriate.

   Arguments:  reference name
               mailbox name with possible wildcards

   Responses:  untagged responses: LIST

   Result:     OK - list completed
               NO - list failure: can't list that reference or name
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The LIST command returns a subset of names from the complete set
      of all names available to the client.  Zero or more untagged LIST
      replies are returned, containing the name attributes, hierarchy
      delimiter, and name; see the description of the LIST reply for
      more detail.

      The LIST command SHOULD return its data quickly, without undue
      delay.  For example, it SHOULD NOT go to excess trouble to
      calculate the \Marked or \Unmarked status or perform other
      processing; if each name requires 1 second of processing, then a
      list of 1200 names would take 20 minutes!

      An empty ("" string) reference name argument indicates that the
      mailbox name is interpreted as by SELECT.  The returned mailbox
      names MUST match the supplied mailbox name pattern.  A non-empty
      reference name argument is the name of a mailbox or a level of
      mailbox hierarchy, and indicates the context in which the mailbox
      name is interpreted.

      An empty ("" string) mailbox name argument is a special request to
      return the hierarchy delimiter and the root name of the name given
      in the reference.  The value returned as the root MAY be the empty
      string if the reference is non-rooted or is an empty string.  In
      all cases, a hierarchy delimiter (or NIL if there is no hierarchy)
      is returned.  This permits a client to get the hierarchy delimiter
      (or find out that the mailbox names are flat) even when no
      mailboxes by that name currently exist.

      The reference and mailbox name arguments are interpreted into a
      canonical form that represents an unambiguous left-to-right
      hierarchy.  The returned mailbox names will be in the interpreted
      form.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3501.html">RFC 3501</a>                         IMAPv4                       March 2003</span>


           Note: The interpretation of the reference argument is
           implementation-defined.  It depends upon whether the
           server implementation has a concept of the "current
           working directory" and leading "break out characters",
           which override the current working directory.

           For example, on a server which exports a UNIX or NT
           filesystem, the reference argument contains the current
           working directory, and the mailbox name argument would
           contain the name as interpreted in the current working
           directory.

           If a server implementation has no concept of break out
           characters, the canonical form is normally the reference
           name appended with the mailbox name.  Note that if the
           server implements the namespace convention (<a href="#section-5.1.2">section</a>
           <a href="#section-5.1.2">5.1.2</a>), "#" is a break out character and must be treated
           as such.

           If the reference argument is not a level of mailbox
           hierarchy (that is, it is a \NoInferiors name), and/or
           the reference argument does not end with the hierarchy
           delimiter, it is implementation-dependent how this is
           interpreted.  For example, a reference of "foo/bar" and
           mailbox name of "rag/baz" could be interpreted as
           "foo/bar/rag/baz", "foo/barrag/baz", or "foo/rag/baz".
           A client SHOULD NOT use such a reference argument except
           at the explicit request of the user.  A hierarchical
           browser MUST NOT make any assumptions about server
           interpretation of the reference unless the reference is
           a level of mailbox hierarchy AND ends with the hierarchy
           delimiter.

      Any part of the reference argument that is included in the
      interpreted form SHOULD prefix the interpreted form.  It SHOULD
      also be in the same form as the reference name argument.  This
      rule permits the client to determine if the returned mailbox name
      is in the context of the reference argument, or if something about
      the mailbox argument overrode the reference argument.  Without
      this rule, the client would have to have knowledge of the server's
      naming semantics including what characters are "breakouts" that
      override a naming context.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3501.html">RFC 3501</a>                         IMAPv4                       March 2003</span>


           For example, here are some examples of how references
           and mailbox names might be interpreted on a UNIX-based
           server:

               Reference     Mailbox Name  Interpretation
               ------------  ------------  --------------
               ~smith/Mail/  foo.*         ~smith/Mail/foo.*
               archive/      %             archive/%
               #news.        comp.mail.*   #news.comp.mail.*
               ~smith/Mail/  /usr/doc/foo  /usr/doc/foo
               archive/      ~fred/Mail/*  ~fred/Mail/*

           The first three examples demonstrate interpretations in
           the context of the reference argument.  Note that
           "~smith/Mail" SHOULD NOT be transformed into something
           like "/u2/users/smith/Mail", or it would be impossible
           for the client to determine that the interpretation was
           in the context of the reference.

      The character "*" is a wildcard, and matches zero or more
      characters at this position.  The character "%" is similar to "*",
      but it does not match a hierarchy delimiter.  If the "%" wildcard
      is the last character of a mailbox name argument, matching levels
      of hierarchy are also returned.  If these levels of hierarchy are
      not also selectable mailboxes, they are returned with the
      \Noselect mailbox name attribute (see the description of the LIST
      response for more details).

      Server implementations are permitted to "hide" otherwise
      accessible mailboxes from the wildcard characters, by preventing
      certain characters or names from matching a wildcard in certain
      situations.  For example, a UNIX-based server might restrict the
      interpretation of "*" so that an initial "/" character does not
      match.

      The special name INBOX is included in the output from LIST, if
      INBOX is supported by this server for this user and if the
      uppercase string "INBOX" matches the interpreted reference and
      mailbox name arguments with wildcards as described above.  The
      criteria for omitting INBOX is whether SELECT INBOX will return
      failure; it is not relevant whether the user's real INBOX resides
      on this or some other server.

   Arguments:  reference name

               NO - lsub failure: can't list that reference or name
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The LSUB command returns a subset of names from the set of names
      that the user has declared as being "active" or "subscribed".
      Zero or more untagged LSUB replies are returned.  The arguments to
      LSUB are in the same form as those for LIST.

      The returned untagged LSUB response MAY contain different mailbox
      flags from a LIST untagged response.  If this should happen, the
      flags in the untagged LIST are considered more authoritative.

      A special situation occurs when using LSUB with the % wildcard.
      Consider what happens if "foo/bar" (with a hierarchy delimiter of
      "/") is subscribed but "foo" is not.  A "%" wildcard to LSUB must
      return foo, not foo/bar, in the LSUB response, and it MUST be
      flagged with the \Noselect attribute.

      The server MUST NOT unilaterally remove an existing mailbox name
      from the subscription list even if a mailbox by that name no
      longer exists.

   Arguments:  mailbox name
               status data item names

   Responses:  untagged responses: STATUS

   Result:     OK - status completed
               NO - status failure: no status for that name
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The STATUS command requests the status of the indicated mailbox.
      It does not change the currently selected mailbox, nor does it
      affect the state of any messages in the queried mailbox (in
      particular, STATUS MUST NOT cause messages to lose the \Recent
      flag).

      The STATUS command provides an alternative to opening a second
      IMAP4rev1 connection and doing an EXAMINE command on a mailbox to
      query that mailbox's status without deselecting the current
      mailbox in the first IMAP4rev1 connection.

      Unlike the LIST command, the STATUS command is not guaranteed to
      be fast in its response.  Under certain circumstances, it can be
      quite slow.  In some implementations, the server is obliged to
      open the mailbox read-only internally to obtain certain status
      information.  Also unlike the LIST command, the STATUS command
      does not accept wildcards.

           Note: The STATUS command is intended to access the
           status of mailboxes other than the currently selected
           mailbox.  Because the STATUS command can cause the
           mailbox to be opened internally, and because this
           information is available by other means on the selected
           mailbox, the STATUS command SHOULD NOT be used on the
           currently selected mailbox.

           The STATUS command MUST NOT be used as a "check for new
           messages in the selected mailbox" operation (refer to
           sections <a href="#section-7">7</a>, <a href="#section-7.3.1">7.3.1</a>, and <a href="#section-7.3.2">7.3.2</a> for more information about
           the proper method for new message checking).

           Because the STATUS command is not guaranteed to be fast
           in its results, clients SHOULD NOT expect to be able to
           issue many consecutive STATUS commands and obtain
           reasonable performance.

      The currently defined status data items that can be requested are:

      MESSAGES
         The number of messages in the mailbox.

      RECENT
         The number of messages with the \Recent flag set.

      UIDNEXT
         The next unique identifier value of the mailbox.  Refer to
         <a href="#section-2.3.1.1">section 2.3.1.1</a> for more information.

      UIDVALIDITY
         The unique identifier validity value of the mailbox.  Refer to
         <a href="#section-2.3.1.1">section 2.3.1.1</a> for more information.

      UNSEEN
         The number of messages which do not have the \Seen flag set.

               OPTIONAL date/time string
               message literal

                    in flags or date/time or message text
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The APPEND command appends the literal argument as a new message
      to the end of the specified destination mailbox.  This argument
      SHOULD be in the format of an [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] message.  8-bit
      characters are permitted in the message.  A server implementation
      that is unable to preserve 8-bit data properly MUST be able to
      reversibly convert 8-bit APPEND data to 7-bit using a [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>]
      content transfer encoding.

           Note: There MAY be exceptions, e.g., draft messages, in
           which required [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header lines are omitted in
           the message literal argument to APPEND.  The full
           implications of doing so MUST be understood and
           carefully weighed.

      If a flag parenthesized list is specified, the flags SHOULD be set
      in the resulting message; otherwise, the flag list of the
      resulting message is set to empty by default.  In either case, the
      Recent flag is also set.

      If a date-time is specified, the internal date SHOULD be set in
      the resulting message; otherwise, the internal date of the
      resulting message is set to the current date and time by default.

      If the append is unsuccessful for any reason, the mailbox MUST be
      restored to its state before the APPEND attempt; no partial
      appending is permitted.

      If the destination mailbox does not exist, a server MUST return an
      error, and MUST NOT automatically create the mailbox.  Unless it
      is certain that the destination mailbox can not be created, the
      server MUST send the response code "[TRYCREATE]" as the prefix of
      the text of the tagged NO response.  This gives a hint to the
      client that it can attempt a CREATE command and retry the APPEND
      if the CREATE is successful.

      If the mailbox is currently selected, the normal new message
      actions SHOULD occur.  Specifically, the server SHOULD notify the
      client immediately via an untagged EXISTS response.  If the server
      does not do so, the client MAY issue a NOOP command (or failing
      that, a CHECK command) after one or more APPEND commands.

      disk) that is not normally executed as part of each command.  A
      checkpoint MAY take a non-instantaneous amount of real time to
      complete.  If a server implementation has no such housekeeping
      considerations, CHECK is equivalent to NOOP.

      There is no guarantee that an EXISTS untagged response will happen
      as a result of CHECK.  NOOP, not CHECK, SHOULD be used for new
      message polling.

   Arguments:  none

   Responses:  no specific responses for this command

   Result:     OK - close completed, now in authenticated state
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The CLOSE command permanently removes all messages that have the
      \Deleted flag set from the currently selected mailbox, and returns
      to the authenticated state from the selected state.  No untagged
      EXPUNGE responses are sent.

      No messages are removed, and no error is given, if the mailbox is
      selected by an EXAMINE command or is otherwise selected read-only.

      Even if a mailbox is selected, a SELECT, EXAMINE, or LOGOUT
      command MAY be issued without previously issuing a CLOSE command.
      The SELECT, EXAMINE, and LOGOUT commands implicitly close the
      currently selected mailbox without doing an expunge.  However,
      when many messages are deleted, a CLOSE-LOGOUT or CLOSE-SELECT
      sequence is considerably faster than an EXPUNGE-LOGOUT or
      EXPUNGE-SELECT because no untagged EXPUNGE responses (which the
      client would probably ignore) are sent.

   Example:    C: A341 CLOSE
               S: A341 OK CLOSE completed

                    denied)
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The EXPUNGE command permanently removes all messages that have the
      \Deleted flag set from the currently selected mailbox.  Before
      returning an OK to the client, an untagged EXPUNGE response is
      sent for each message that is removed.

   Example:    C: A202 EXPUNGE

               S: * 3 EXPUNGE
               S: * 5 EXPUNGE
               S: * 8 EXPUNGE
               S: A202 OK EXPUNGE completed

        Note: In this example, messages 3, 4, 7, and 11 had the
        \Deleted flag set.  See the description of the EXPUNGE

      The SEARCH command searches the mailbox for messages that match
      the given searching criteria.  Searching criteria consist of one
      or more search keys.  The untagged SEARCH response from the server
      contains a listing of message sequence numbers corresponding to
      those messages that match the searching criteria.

      When multiple keys are specified, the result is the intersection
      (AND function) of all the messages that match those keys.  For
      example, the criteria DELETED FROM "SMITH" SINCE 1-Feb-1994 refers
      to all deleted messages from Smith that were placed in the mailbox
      since February 1, 1994.  A search key can also be a parenthesized
      list of one or more search keys (e.g., for use with the OR and NOT
      keys).

      Server implementations MAY exclude [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>] body parts with
      terminal content media types other than TEXT and MESSAGE from
      consideration in SEARCH matching.

      The OPTIONAL [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Character Set Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>] specification consists of the word
      "CHARSET" followed by a registered [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Character Set Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>].  It indicates the
      [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Character Set Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>] of the strings that appear in the search criteria.

      text in a [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Character Set Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>] other than US-ASCII.  US-ASCII MUST be
      supported; other [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Character Set Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>]s MAY be supported.

      If the server does not support the specified [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Character Set Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>], it MUST
      return a tagged NO response (not a BAD).  This response SHOULD
      contain the BADCHARSET response code, which MAY list the
      [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Character Set Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>]s supported by the server.

      In all search keys that use strings, a message matches the key if
      the string is a substring of the field.  The matching is
      case-insensitive.

      The defined search keys are as follows.  Refer to the Formal
      Syntax section for the precise syntactic definitions of the
      arguments.

               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The FETCH command retrieves data associated with a message in the
      mailbox.  The data items to be fetched can be either a single atom
      or a parenthesized list.

      Most data items, identified in the formal syntax under the
      msg-att-static rule, are static and MUST NOT change for any
      particular message.  Other data items, identified in the formal
      syntax under the msg-att-dynamic rule, MAY change, either as a
      result of a STORE command or due to external events.

           For example, if a client receives an ENVELOPE for a
           message when it already knows the envelope, it can
           safely ignore the newly transmitted envelope.

      There are three macros which specify commonly-used sets of data
      items, and can be used instead of data items.  A macro must be
      used by itself, and not in conjunction with other macros or data
      items.

      BODY[&lt;section&gt;]&lt;&lt;partial&gt;&gt;
         The text of a particular body section.  The section
         specification is a set of zero or more part specifiers
         delimited by periods.  A part specifier is either a part number
         or one of the following: HEADER, HEADER.FIELDS,
         HEADER.FIELDS.NOT, MIME, and TEXT.  An empty section
         specification refers to the entire message, including the
         header.

         Every message has at least one part number.  Non-[<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>]
         messages, and non-multipart [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>] messages with no
         encapsulated message, only have a part 1.

         Multipart messages are assigned consecutive part numbers, as
         they occur in the message.  If a particular part is of type
         message or multipart, its parts MUST be indicated by a period
         followed by the part number within that nested multipart part.

         A part of type MESSAGE/RFC822 also has nested part numbers,
         referring to parts of the MESSAGE part's body.

         The HEADER, HEADER.FIELDS, HEADER.FIELDS.NOT, and TEXT part
         specifiers can be the sole part specifier or can be prefixed by
         one or more numeric part specifiers, provided that the numeric
         part specifier refers to a part of type MESSAGE/RFC822.  The
         MIME part specifier MUST be prefixed by one or more numeric
         part specifiers.

         The HEADER, HEADER.FIELDS, and HEADER.FIELDS.NOT part
         specifiers refer to the [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header of the message or of
         an encapsulated [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMT" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Two: Media Types"'>MIME-IMT</a>] MESSAGE/RFC822 message.
         HEADER.FIELDS and HEADER.FIELDS.NOT are followed by a list of

         subset of the header.  The subset returned by HEADER.FIELDS
         contains only those header fields with a field-name that
         matches one of the names in the list; similarly, the subset
         returned by HEADER.FIELDS.NOT contains only the header fields

         line.

         The MIME part specifier refers to the [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>] header for
         this part.

         The TEXT part specifier refers to the text body of the message,
         omitting the [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header.

            Here is an example of a complex message with some of its
            part specifiers:

       HEADER     ([<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header of the message)
       TEXT       ([<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] text body of the message) MULTIPART/MIXED
       1          TEXT/PLAIN
       2          APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM
       3          MESSAGE/RFC822
       3.HEADER   ([<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header of the message)
       3.TEXT     ([<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] text body of the message) MULTIPART/MIXED
       3.1        TEXT/PLAIN
       3.2        APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM
       4          MULTIPART/MIXED
       4.1        IMAGE/GIF
       4.1.MIME   ([<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>] header for the IMAGE/GIF)
       4.2        MESSAGE/RFC822
       4.2.HEADER ([<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header of the message)
       4.2.TEXT   ([<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] text body of the message) MULTIPART/MIXED
       4.2.1      TEXT/PLAIN
       4.2.2      MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE
       4.2.2.1    TEXT/PLAIN
       4.2.2.2    TEXT/RICHTEXT


         It is possible to fetch a substring of the designated text.
         This is done by appending an open angle bracket ("&lt;"), the
         octet position of the first desired octet, a period, the
         maximum number of octets desired, and a close angle bracket
         ("&gt;") to the part specifier.  If the starting octet is beyond
         the end of the text, an empty string is returned.

         Any partial fetch that attempts to read beyond the end of the
         text is truncated as appropriate.  A partial fetch that starts
         at octet 0 is returned as a partial fetch, even if this
         truncation happened.

            Note: This means that BODY[]&lt;0.2048&gt; of a 1500-octet message
            will return BODY[]&lt;0&gt; with a literal of size 1500, not
            BODY[].

            Note: A substring fetch of a HEADER.FIELDS or
            HEADER.FIELDS.NOT part specifier is calculated after
            subsetting the header.

         The \Seen flag is implicitly set; if this causes the flags to
         change, they SHOULD be included as part of the FETCH responses.

      BODY.PEEK[&lt;section&gt;]&lt;&lt;partial&gt;&gt;
         An alternate form of BODY[&lt;section&gt;] that does not implicitly
         set the \Seen flag.

      BODYSTRUCTURE
         The [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>] body structure of the message.  This is computed
         by the server by parsing the [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>] header fields in the
         [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header and [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>] headers.

      ENVELOPE
         The envelope structure of the message.  This is computed by the
         server by parsing the [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header into the component
         parts, defaulting various fields as necessary.

      FLAGS
         The flags that are set for this message.

      INTERNALDATE
         The internal date of the message.

   Arguments:  sequence set
               message data item name
               value for message data item

   Responses:  untagged responses: FETCH

   Result:     OK - store completed
               NO - store error: can't store that data

      The STORE command alters data associated with a message in the
      mailbox.  Normally, STORE will return the updated value of the
      data with an untagged FETCH response.  A suffix of ".SILENT" in
      the data item name prevents the untagged FETCH, and the server
      SHOULD assume that the client has determined the updated value
      itself or does not care about the updated value.

           Note: Regardless of whether or not the ".SILENT" suffix
           was used, the server SHOULD send an untagged FETCH
           response if a change to a message's flags from an
           external source is observed.  The intent is that the
           status of the flags is determinate without a race
           condition.

      The currently defined data items that can be stored are:

      FLAGS &lt;flag list&gt;
         Replace the flags for the message (other than \Recent) with the

      +FLAGS &lt;flag list&gt;
         Add the argument to the flags for the message.  The new value

      The COPY command copies the specified message(s) to the end of the
      specified destination mailbox.  The flags and internal date of the
      message(s) SHOULD be preserved, and the Recent flag SHOULD be set,
      in the copy.

      If the destination mailbox does not exist, a server SHOULD return
      an error.  It SHOULD NOT automatically create the mailbox.  Unless
      it is certain that the destination mailbox can not be created, the
      server MUST send the response code "[TRYCREATE]" as the prefix of
      the text of the tagged NO response.  This gives a hint to the
      client that it can attempt a CREATE command and retry the COPY if
      the CREATE is successful.

      If the COPY command is unsuccessful for any reason, server
      implementations MUST restore the destination mailbox to its state
      before the COPY attempt.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.4.8.%20%20UID%20Command"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.4.8" name="section-6.4.8">6.4.8</a>.  UID Command</span>

   Arguments:  command name
               command arguments

   Responses:  untagged responses: FETCH, SEARCH

   Result:     OK - UID command completed
               NO - UID command error
               BAD - command unknown or arguments invalid

      The UID command has two forms.  In the first form, it takes as its
      arguments a COPY, FETCH, or STORE command with arguments
      appropriate for the associated command.  However, the numbers in
      the sequence set argument are unique identifiers instead of
      message sequence numbers.  Sequence set ranges are permitted, but
      there is no guarantee that unique identifiers will be contiguous.

      A non-existent unique identifier is ignored without any error
      message generated.  Thus, it is possible for a UID FETCH command
      to return an OK without any data or a UID COPY or UID STORE to
      return an OK without performing any operations.

      In the second form, the UID command takes a SEARCH command with
      SEARCH command arguments.  The interpretation of the arguments is
      the same as with SEARCH; however, the numbers returned in a SEARCH
      response for a UID SEARCH command are unique identifiers instead

      of message sequence numbers.  For example, the command UID SEARCH
      1:100 UID 443:557 returns the unique identifiers corresponding to
      the intersection of two sequence sets, the message sequence number
      range 1:100 and the UID range 443:557.

           Note: in the above example, the UID range 443:557
           appears.  The same comment about a non-existent unique
           identifier being ignored without any error message also
           applies here.  Hence, even if neither UID 443 or 557
           exist, this range is valid and would include an existing
           UID 495.

           Also note that a UID range of 559:* always includes the
           UID of the last message in the mailbox, even if 559 is
           higher than any assigned UID value.  This is because the
           contents of a range are independent of the order of the
           range endpoints.  Thus, any UID range with * as one of
           the endpoints indicates at least one message (the
           message with the highest numbered UID), unless the
           mailbox is empty.

      The number after the "*" in an untagged FETCH response is always a
      message sequence number, not a unique identifier, even for a UID
      command response.  However, server implementations MUST implicitly
      include the UID message data item as part of any FETCH response
      caused by a UID command, regardless of whether a UID was specified
      as a message data item to the FETCH.


      Note: The rule about including the UID message data item as part
      of a FETCH response primarily applies to the UID FETCH and UID
      STORE commands, including a UID FETCH command that does not
      include UID as a message data item.  Although it is unlikely that
      the other UID commands will cause an untagged FETCH, this rule
      applies to these commands as well.

   Example:    C: A999 UID FETCH 4827313:4828442 FLAGS
               S: * 23 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) UID 4827313)
               S: * 24 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) UID 4827943)
               S: * 25 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) UID 4828442)
               S: A999 OK UID FETCH completed

   Server responses are in three forms: status responses, server data,
   and command continuation request.  The information contained in a
   server response, identified by "Contents:" in the response
   descriptions below, is described by function, not by syntax.  The
   precise syntax of server responses is described in the Formal Syntax
   section.

   The client MUST be prepared to accept any response at all times.

   Status responses can be tagged or untagged.  Tagged status responses
   indicate the completion result (OK, NO, or BAD status) of a client
   command, and have a tag matching the command.

   Some status responses, and all server data, are untagged.  An
   untagged response is indicated by the token "*" instead of a tag.
   Untagged status responses indicate server greeting, or server status

   that does not indicate the completion of a command (for example, an
   impending system shutdown alert).  For historical reasons, untagged
   server data responses are also called "unsolicited data", although
   strictly speaking, only unilateral server data is truly
   "unsolicited".

   Certain server data MUST be recorded by the client when it is
   received; this is noted in the description of that data.  Such data
   conveys critical information which affects the interpretation of all
   subsequent commands and responses (e.g., updates reflecting the
   creation or destruction of messages).

   Other server data SHOULD be recorded for later reference; if the
   client does not need to record the data, or if recording the data has
   no obvious purpose (e.g., a SEARCH response when no SEARCH command is
   in progress), the data SHOULD be ignored.

   An example of unilateral untagged server data occurs when the IMAP
   connection is in the selected state.  In the selected state, the
   server checks the mailbox for new messages as part of command
   execution.  Normally, this is part of the execution of every command;
   hence, a NOOP command suffices to check for new messages.  If new
   messages are found, the server sends untagged EXISTS and RECENT
   responses reflecting the new size of the mailbox.  Server
   implementations that offer multiple simultaneous access to the same
   mailbox SHOULD also send appropriate unilateral untagged FETCH and
   EXPUNGE responses if another agent changes the state of any message
   flags or expunges any messages.

   Command continuation request responses use the token "+" instead of a
   tag.  These responses are sent by the server to indicate acceptance
   of an incomplete client command and readiness for the remainder of
   the command.

   Status responses are OK, NO, BAD, PREAUTH and BYE.  OK, NO, and BAD
   can be tagged or untagged.  PREAUTH and BYE are always untagged.

   Status responses MAY include an OPTIONAL "response code".  A response
   code consists of data inside square brackets in the form of an atom,
   possibly followed by a space and arguments.  The response code
   contains additional information or status codes for client software
   beyond the OK/NO/BAD condition, and are defined when there is a
   specific action that a client can take based upon the additional
   information.

         attention to the message.

      BADCHARSET

         Optionally followed by a parenthesized list of charsets.  A
         SEARCH failed because the given charset is not supported by
         this implementation.  If the optional list of charsets is
         given, this lists the charsets that are supported by this
         implementation.

      CAPABILITY

         Followed by a list of capabilities.  This can appear in the
         initial OK or PREAUTH response to transmit an initial
         capabilities list.  This makes it unnecessary for a client to
         send a separate CAPABILITY command if it recognizes this
         response.

      PARSE

         The human-readable text represents an error in parsing the
         [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header or [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>] headers of a message in the
         mailbox.

      PERMANENTFLAGS

         Followed by a parenthesized list of flags, indicates which of
         the known flags the client can change permanently.  Any flags
         that are in the FLAGS untagged response, but not the
         PERMANENTFLAGS list, can not be set permanently.  If the client
         attempts to STORE a flag that is not in the PERMANENTFLAGS
         list, the server will either ignore the change or store the
         state change for the remainder of the current session only.
         The PERMANENTFLAGS list can also include the special flag \*,
         which indicates that it is possible to create new keywords by
         attempting to store those flags in the mailbox.

      READ-ONLY

         The mailbox is selected read-only, or its access while selected
         has changed from read-write to read-only.

      READ-WRITE

         The mailbox is selected read-write, or its access while
         selected has changed from read-only to read-write.

      TRYCREATE

         An APPEND or COPY attempt is failing because the target mailbox
         does not exist (as opposed to some other reason).  This is a
         hint to the client that the operation can succeed if the
         mailbox is first created by the CREATE command.

      UIDNEXT

         Followed by a decimal number, indicates the next unique
         identifier value.  Refer to <a href="#section-2.3.1.1">section 2.3.1.1</a> for more
         information.

      UNSEEN

         Followed by a decimal number, indicates the number of the first
         message without the \Seen flag set.

      Additional response codes defined by particular client or server
      implementations SHOULD be prefixed with an "X" until they are
      added to a revision of this protocol.  Client implementations
      SHOULD ignore response codes that they do not recognize.

      The PREAUTH response is always untagged, and is one of three
      possible greetings at connection startup.  It indicates that the
      connection has already been authenticated by external means; thus
      no LOGIN command is needed.

   Contents:   OPTIONAL response code
               human-readable text

      The BYE response is always untagged, and indicates that the server
      is about to close the connection.  The human-readable text MAY be
      displayed to the user in a status report by the client.  The BYE
      response is sent under one of four conditions:

         1) as part of a normal logout sequence.  The server will close
            the connection after sending the tagged OK response to the
            LOGOUT command.

         2) as a panic shutdown announcement.  The server closes the
            connection immediately.

         3) as an announcement of an inactivity autologout.  The server
            closes the connection immediately.

         4) as one of three possible greetings at connection startup,
            indicating that the server is not willing to accept a
            connection from this client.  The server closes the
            connection immediately.

      The difference between a BYE that occurs as part of a normal
      LOGOUT sequence (the first case) and a BYE that occurs because of
      a failure (the other three cases) is that the connection closes
      immediately in the failure case.  In all cases the client SHOULD
      continue to read response data from the server until the
      connection is closed; this will ensure that any pending untagged
      or completion responses are read and processed.

   Example:    S: * BYE Autologout; idle for too long

   These responses are always untagged.  This is how server and mailbox
   status data are transmitted from the server to the client.  Many of
   these responses typically result from a command with the same name.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.2.1.%20%20CAPABILITY%20Response"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2.1" name="section-7.2.1">7.2.1</a>.  CAPABILITY Response</span>

   Contents:   capability listing

      The CAPABILITY response occurs as a result of a CAPABILITY
      command.  The capability listing contains a space-separated
      listing of capability names that the server supports.  The
      capability listing MUST include the atom "IMAP4rev1".

      In addition, client and server implementations MUST implement the
      STARTTLS, LOGINDISABLED, and AUTH=PLAIN (described in [<a href="#ref-IMAP-TLS" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>IMAP-TLS</a>])
      capabilities.  See the Security Considerations section for
      important information.

      A capability name which begins with "AUTH=" indicates that the
      server supports that particular authentication mechanism.

      The LOGINDISABLED capability indicates that the LOGIN command is
      disabled, and that the server will respond with a tagged NO
      response to any attempt to use the LOGIN command even if the user
      name and password are valid.  An IMAP client MUST NOT issue the
      LOGIN command if the server advertises the LOGINDISABLED
      capability.

      Other capability names indicate that the server supports an
      extension, revision, or amendment to the IMAP4rev1 protocol.
      Server responses MUST conform to this document until the client
      issues a command that uses the associated capability.

      Capability names MUST either begin with "X" or be standard or
      standards-track IMAP4rev1 extensions, revisions, or amendments
      registered with IANA.  A server MUST NOT offer unregistered or

      non-standard capability names, unless such names are prefixed with
      an "X".

      Client implementations SHOULD NOT require any capability name
      other than "IMAP4rev1", and MUST ignore any unknown capability
      names.

      A server MAY send capabilities automatically, by using the
      CAPABILITY response code in the initial PREAUTH or OK responses,
      and by sending an updated CAPABILITY response code in the tagged
      OK response as part of a successful authentication.  It is
      unnecessary for a client to send a separate CAPABILITY command if
      it recognizes these automatic capabilities.

   Example:    S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 STARTTLS AUTH=GSSAPI XPIG-LATIN

   Contents:   name attributes
               hierarchy delimiter
               name

      The LIST response occurs as a result of a LIST command.  It
      returns a single name that matches the LIST specification.  There
      can be multiple LIST responses for a single LIST command.

      Four name attributes are defined:

      \Noinferiors
         It is not possible for any child levels of hierarchy to exist
         under this name; no child levels exist now and none can be
         created in the future.

      \Noselect
         It is not possible to use this name as a selectable mailbox.

      \Marked
         The mailbox has been marked "interesting" by the server; the
         mailbox probably contains messages that have been added since
         the last time the mailbox was selected.

      \Unmarked
         The mailbox does not contain any additional messages since the
         last time the mailbox was selected.

      If it is not feasible for the server to determine whether or not
      the mailbox is "interesting", or if the name is a \Noselect name,
      the server SHOULD NOT send either \Marked or \Unmarked.

      The hierarchy delimiter is a character used to delimit levels of
      hierarchy in a mailbox name.  A client can use it to create child
      mailboxes, and to search higher or lower levels of naming
      hierarchy.  All children of a top-level hierarchy node MUST use
      the same separator character.  A NIL hierarchy delimiter means
      that no hierarchy exists; the name is a "flat" name.

      The name represents an unambiguous left-to-right hierarchy, and
      MUST be valid for use as a reference in LIST and LSUB commands.
      Unless \Noselect is indicated, the name MUST also be valid as an
      argument for commands, such as SELECT, that accept mailbox names.

   Example:    S: * LIST (\Noselect) "/" ~/Mail/foo

   Contents:   name attributes
               hierarchy delimiter
               name

      The LSUB response occurs as a result of an LSUB command.  It
      returns a single name that matches the LSUB specification.  There
      can be multiple LSUB responses for a single LSUB command.  The
      data is identical in format to the LIST response.

   Example:    S: * LSUB () "." #news.comp.mail.misc

      The STATUS response occurs as a result of an STATUS command.  It

      the requested mailbox status information.

   Example:    S: * STATUS blurdybloop (MESSAGES 231 UIDNEXT 44292)

      The RECENT response reports the number of messages with the
      \Recent flag set.  This response occurs as a result of a SELECT or
      EXAMINE command, and if the size of the mailbox changes (e.g., new
      messages).

           Note: It is not guaranteed that the message sequence
           numbers of recent messages will be a contiguous range of
           the highest n messages in the mailbox (where n is the
           value reported by the RECENT response).  Examples of
           situations in which this is not the case are: multiple
           clients having the same mailbox open (the first session
           to be notified will see it as recent, others will
           probably see it as non-recent), and when the mailbox is
           re-ordered by a non-IMAP agent.

           The only reliable way to identify recent messages is to
           look at message flags to see which have the \Recent flag
           set, or to do a SEARCH RECENT.

      The update from the RECENT response MUST be recorded by the
      client.

   Example:    S: * 5 RECENT

   These responses are always untagged.  This is how message data are
   transmitted from the server to the client, often as a result of a
   command with the same name.  Immediately following the "*" token is a
   number that represents a message sequence number.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.4.1.%20%20EXPUNGE%20Response"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.4.1" name="section-7.4.1">7.4.1</a>.  EXPUNGE Response</span>

   Contents:   none

      The EXPUNGE response reports that the specified message sequence
      number has been permanently removed from the mailbox.  The message
      sequence number for each successive message in the mailbox is
      immediately decremented by 1, and this decrement is reflected in
      message sequence numbers in subsequent responses (including other
      untagged EXPUNGE responses).

      The EXPUNGE response also decrements the number of messages in the
      mailbox; it is not necessary to send an EXISTS response with the
      new value.

      As a result of the immediate decrement rule, message sequence
      numbers that appear in a set of successive EXPUNGE responses
      depend upon whether the messages are removed starting from lower
      numbers to higher numbers, or from higher numbers to lower
      numbers.  For example, if the last 5 messages in a 9-message
      mailbox are expunged, a "lower to higher" server will send five
      untagged EXPUNGE responses for message sequence number 5, whereas
      a "higher to lower server" will send successive untagged EXPUNGE
      responses for message sequence numbers 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5.

      An EXPUNGE response MUST NOT be sent when no command is in
      progress, nor while responding to a FETCH, STORE, or SEARCH
      command.  This rule is necessary to prevent a loss of
      synchronization of message sequence numbers between client and
      server.  A command is not "in progress" until the complete command
      has been received; in particular, a command is not "in progress"
      during the negotiation of command continuation.

           Note: UID FETCH, UID STORE, and UID SEARCH are different
           commands from FETCH, STORE, and SEARCH.  An EXPUNGE
           response MAY be sent during a UID command.

      The update from the EXPUNGE response MUST be recorded by the
      client.

   Example:    S: * 44 EXPUNGE

   Contents:   message data

      The FETCH response returns data about a message to the client.
      The data are pairs of data item names and their values in
      parentheses.  This response occurs as the result of a FETCH or
      STORE command, as well as by unilateral server decision (e.g.,
      flag updates).

      The current data items are:

      BODY
         A form of BODYSTRUCTURE without extension data.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3501.html">RFC 3501</a>                         IMAPv4                       March 2003</span>


      BODY[&lt;section&gt;]&lt;&lt;origin octet&gt;&gt;
         A string expressing the body contents of the specified section.
         The string SHOULD be interpreted by the client according to the
         content transfer encoding, body type, and subtype.

         If the origin octet is specified, this string is a substring of
         the entire body contents, starting at that origin octet.  This
         means that BODY[]&lt;0&gt; MAY be truncated, but BODY[] is NEVER
         truncated.

            Note: The origin octet facility MUST NOT be used by a server
            in a FETCH response unless the client specifically requested
            it by means of a FETCH of a BODY[&lt;section&gt;]&lt;&lt;partial&gt;&gt; data
            item.

         8-bit textual data is permitted if a [<a href="#ref-CHARSET" title='"IANA Character Set Registration Procedures"'>CHARSET</a>] identifier is
         part of the body parameter parenthesized list for this section.
         Note that headers (part specifiers HEADER or MIME, or the
         header portion of a MESSAGE/RFC822 part), MUST be 7-bit; 8-bit
         characters are not permitted in headers.  Note also that the
         [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] delimiting blank line between the header and the
         body is not affected by header line subsetting; the blank line
         is always included as part of header data, except in the case
         of a message which has no body and no blank line.

         Non-textual data such as binary data MUST be transfer encoded
         into a textual form, such as BASE64, prior to being sent to the
         client.  To derive the original binary data, the client MUST
         decode the transfer encoded string.

      BODYSTRUCTURE
         A parenthesized list that describes the [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>] body
         structure of a message.  This is computed by the server by
         parsing the [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>] header fields, defaulting various fields
         as necessary.

         For example, a simple text message of 48 lines and 2279 octets
         can have a body structure of: ("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET"
         "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 2279 48)

         Multiple parts are indicated by parenthesis nesting.  Instead
         of a body type as the first element of the parenthesized list,
         there is a sequence of one or more nested body structures.  The
         second element of the parenthesized list is the multipart
         subtype (mixed, digest, parallel, alternative, etc.).






<span class="grey">Crispin                     Standards Track                    [Page 74]</span></pre>

         For example, a two part message consisting of a text and a
         BASE64-encoded text attachment can have a body structure of:
         (("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 1152
         23)("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII" "NAME" "cc.diff")

         "BASE64" 4554 73) "MIXED")

         Extension data follows the multipart subtype.  Extension data
         is never returned with the BODY fetch, but can be returned with
         a BODYSTRUCTURE fetch.  Extension data, if present, MUST be in
         the defined order.  The extension data of a multipart body part
         are in the following order:

         body parameter parenthesized list
            A parenthesized list of attribute/value pairs [e.g., ("foo"
            "bar" "baz" "rag") where "bar" is the value of "foo", and
            "rag" is the value of "baz"] as defined in [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>].

         body disposition
            A parenthesized list, consisting of a disposition type
            string, followed by a parenthesized list of disposition
            attribute/value pairs as defined in [<a href="#ref-DISPOSITION" title='"Communicating Presentation Information in Internet Messages: The Content-Disposition Header"'>DISPOSITION</a>].

         body language
            A string or parenthesized list giving the body language
            value as defined in [<a href="#ref-LANGUAGE-TAGS" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>LANGUAGE-TAGS</a>].

         body location
            A string list giving the body content URI as defined in
            [<a href="#ref-LOCATION" title='"MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML)"'>LOCATION</a>].

         Any following extension data are not yet defined in this
         version of the protocol.  Such extension data can consist of
         zero or more NILs, strings, numbers, or potentially nested
         parenthesized lists of such data.  Client implementations that
         do a BODYSTRUCTURE fetch MUST be prepared to accept such
         extension data.  Server implementations MUST NOT send such
         extension data until it has been defined by a revision of this
         protocol.

         The basic fields of a non-multipart body part are in the
         following order:

         body type
            A string giving the content media type name as defined in
            [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>].

         body subtype
            A string giving the content subtype name as defined in
            [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>].

            [<a href="#ref-MIME-IMB" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME-IMB</a>].

         body size
            A number giving the size of the body in octets.  Note that
            this size is the size in its transfer encoding and not the
            resulting size after any decoding.

         A body type of type MESSAGE and subtype <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a> contains,
         immediately after the basic fields, the envelope structure,
         body structure, and size in text lines of the encapsulated
         message.

         A body type of type TEXT contains, immediately after the basic
         fields, the size of the body in text lines.  Note that this
         size is the size in its content transfer encoding and not the
         resulting size after any decoding.

         Extension data follows the basic fields and the type-specific
         fields listed above.  Extension data is never returned with the
         BODY fetch, but can be returned with a BODYSTRUCTURE fetch.
         Extension data, if present, MUST be in the defined order.

         body disposition
            A parenthesized list with the same content and function as
            the body disposition for a multipart body part.

         body language
            A string or parenthesized list giving the body language

            [<a href="#ref-LOCATION" title='"MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML)"'>LOCATION</a>].

         Any following extension data are not yet defined in this
         version of the protocol, and would be as described above under
         multipart extension data.

      ENVELOPE
         A parenthesized list that describes the envelope structure of a
         message.  This is computed by the server by parsing the
         [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header into the component parts, defaulting various
         fields as necessary.

         The fields of the envelope structure are in the following
         order: date, subject, from, sender, reply-to, to, cc, bcc,
         in-reply-to, and message-id.  The date, subject, in-reply-to,
         and message-id fields are strings.  The from, sender, reply-to,
         to, cc, and bcc fields are parenthesized lists of address
         structures.

         An address structure is a parenthesized list that describes an
         electronic mail address.  The fields of an address structure
         are in the following order: personal name, [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>]
         at-domain-list (source route), mailbox name, and host name.

         [<a id="ref-RFC-2822" name="ref-RFC-2822">RFC-2822</a>] group syntax is indicated by a special form of
         address structure in which the host name field is NIL.  If the
         mailbox name field is also NIL, this is an end of group marker
         (semi-colon in <a href="rfc822.html">RFC 822</a> syntax).  If the mailbox name field is
         non-NIL, this is a start of group marker, and the mailbox name
         field holds the group name phrase.

         If the Date, Subject, In-Reply-To, and Message-ID header lines
         are absent in the [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header, the corresponding member
         of the envelope is NIL; if these header lines are present but
         empty the corresponding member of the envelope is the empty
         string.

            Note: some servers may return a NIL envelope member in the
            "present but empty" case.  Clients SHOULD treat NIL and
            empty string as identical.

            Note: [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] requires that all messages have a valid
            Date header.  Therefore, the date member in the envelope can
            not be NIL or the empty string.

            Note: [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] requires that the In-Reply-To and
            Message-ID headers, if present, have non-empty content.
            Therefore, the in-reply-to and message-id members in the
            envelope can not be the empty string.

         If the From, To, cc, and bcc header lines are absent in the
         [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header, or are present but empty, the corresponding
         member of the envelope is NIL.

         If the Sender or Reply-To lines are absent in the [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>]
         header, or are present but empty, the server sets the
         corresponding member of the envelope to be the same value as
         the from member (the client is not expected to know to do
         this).

            Note: [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] requires that all messages have a valid
            From header.  Therefore, the from, sender, and reply-to
            members in the envelope can not be NIL.

      FLAGS
         A parenthesized list of flags that are set for this message.

      INTERNALDATE
         A string representing the internal date of the message.

      <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>
         Equivalent to BODY[].

      <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>.HEADER
         Equivalent to BODY[HEADER].  Note that this did not result in
         \Seen being set, because <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>.HEADER response data occurs as
         a result of a FETCH of <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>.HEADER.  BODY[HEADER] response
         data occurs as a result of a FETCH of BODY[HEADER] (which sets
         \Seen) or BODY.PEEK[HEADER] (which does not set \Seen).

      <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>.SIZE

   The command continuation request response is indicated by a "+" token
   instead of a tag.  This form of response indicates that the server is
   ready to accept the continuation of a command from the client.  The
   remainder of this response is a line of text.

   This response is used in the AUTHENTICATE command to transmit server
   data to the client, and request additional client data.  This
   response is also used if an argument to any command is a literal.

   The client is not permitted to send the octets of the literal unless
   the server indicates that it is expected.  This permits the server to
   process commands and reject errors on a line-by-line basis.  The
   remainder of the command, including the CRLF that terminates a
   command, follows the octets of the literal.  If there are any
   additional command arguments, the literal octets are followed by a
   space and those arguments.

   Example:    C: A001 LOGIN {11}
               S: + Ready for additional command text
               C: FRED FOOBAR {7}

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].

   In the case of alternative or optional rules in which a later rule
   overlaps an earlier rule, the rule which is listed earlier MUST take
   priority.  For example, "\Seen" when parsed as a flag is the \Seen
   flag name and not a flag-extension, even though "\Seen" can be parsed
   as a flag-extension.  Some, but not all, instances of this rule are
   noted below.

        Note: [ABNF] rules MUST be followed strictly; in
        particular:

        (1) Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters
        are case-insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case
        characters to define token strings is for editorial clarity
        only.  Implementations MUST accept these strings in a
        case-insensitive fashion.

        (2) In all cases, SP refers to exactly one space.  It is
        NOT permitted to substitute TAB, insert additional spaces,
        or otherwise treat SP as being equivalent to LWSP.

        (3) The ASCII NUL character, %x00, MUST NOT be used at any
        time.

   This document is a revision or rewrite of earlier documents, and
   supercedes the protocol specification in those documents: <a href="rfc2060.html">RFC 2060</a>,
   <a href="rfc1730.html">RFC 1730</a>, unpublished IMAP2bis.TXT document, <a href="rfc1176.html">RFC 1176</a>, and <a href="rfc1064.html">RFC 1064</a>.

   IMAP4rev1 protocol transactions, including electronic mail data, are
   sent in the clear over the network unless protection from snooping is
   negotiated.  This can be accomplished either by the use of STARTTLS,
   negotiated privacy protection in the AUTHENTICATE command, or some
   other protection mechanism.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.1.%20%20%20STARTTLS%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.1" name="section-11.1">11.1</a>.   STARTTLS Security Considerations</span>

   The specification of the STARTTLS command and LOGINDISABLED
   capability in this document replaces that in [<a href="#ref-IMAP-TLS" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>IMAP-TLS</a>].  [<a href="#ref-IMAP-TLS" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>IMAP-TLS</a>]
   remains normative for the PLAIN [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] authenticator.

   IMAP client and server implementations MUST implement the
   TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] cipher suite, and SHOULD implement the
   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] cipher suite.  This is
   important as it assures that any two compliant implementations can be
   configured to interoperate.  All other cipher suites are OPTIONAL.
   Note that this is a change from section 2.1 of [<a href="#ref-IMAP-TLS" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>IMAP-TLS</a>].

   During the [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] negotiation, the client MUST check its understanding
   of the server hostname against the server's identity as presented in
   the server Certificate message, in order to prevent man-in-the-middle
   attacks.  If the match fails, the client SHOULD either ask for
   explicit user confirmation, or terminate the connection and indicate
   that the server's identity is suspect.  Matching is performed
   according to these rules:

        The client MUST use the server hostname it used to open the
        connection as the value to compare against the server name
        as expressed in the server certificate.  The client MUST
        NOT use any form of the server hostname derived from an
        insecure remote source (e.g., insecure DNS lookup).  CNAME
        canonicalization is not done.

        If a subjectAltName extension of type dNSName is present in
        the certificate, it SHOULD be used as the source of the
        server's identity.

        Matching is case-insensitive.




<span class="grey">Crispin                     Standards Track                    [Page 92]</span></pre>

        A "*" wildcard character MAY be used as the left-most name
        component in the certificate.  For example, *.example.com
        would match a.example.com, foo.example.com, etc. but would
        not match example.com.

        If the certificate contains multiple names (e.g., more than
        one dNSName field), then a match with any one of the fields
        is considered acceptable.

   Both the client and server MUST check the result of the STARTTLS
   command and subsequent [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The TLS Protocol Version 1.0"'>TLS</a>] negotiation to see whether acceptable
   authentication or privacy was achieved.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.2.%20%20%20Other%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.2" name="section-11.2">11.2</a>.   Other Security Considerations</span>

   A server error message for an AUTHENTICATE command which fails due to
   invalid credentials SHOULD NOT detail why the credentials are
   invalid.

   Use of the LOGIN command sends passwords in the clear.  This can be
   avoided by using the AUTHENTICATE command with a [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] mechanism
   that does not use plaintext passwords, by first negotiating
   encryption via STARTTLS or some other protection mechanism.

   A server implementation MUST implement a configuration that, at the
   time of authentication, requires:
      (1) The STARTTLS command has been negotiated.
   OR
      (2) Some other mechanism that protects the session from password
      snooping has been provided.
   OR
      (3) The following measures are in place:
         (a) The LOGINDISABLED capability is advertised, and [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>]
         mechanisms (such as PLAIN) using plaintext passwords are NOT
         advertised in the CAPABILITY list.
      AND
         (b) The LOGIN command returns an error even if the password is
         correct.
      AND
         (c) The AUTHENTICATE command returns an error with all [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>]
         mechanisms that use plaintext passwords, even if the password
         is correct.

   A server error message for a failing LOGIN command SHOULD NOT specify
   that the user name, as opposed to the password, is invalid.

   A server SHOULD have mechanisms in place to limit or delay failed
   AUTHENTICATE/LOGIN attempts.

   at:

        <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities">http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities</a>

   As this specification revises the STARTTLS and LOGINDISABLED

   true.

   80) Clarify that untagged EXPUNGE decrements the number of messages
   in the mailbox.

   81) Fix definition of "body" (concatenation has tighter binding than
   alternation).

   82) Add a new "Special Notes to Implementors" section with reference
   to [<a href="#ref-IMAP-IMPLEMENTATION" title='"IMAP Implementation Recommendations"'>IMAP-IMPLEMENTATION</a>].

   83) Clarify that an untagged CAPABILITY response to an AUTHENTICATE
   command should only be done if a security layer was not negotiated.

   84) Change the definition of atom to exclude "]".  Update astring to
   include "]" for compatibility with the past.  Remove resp-text-atom.

   85) Remove NEWNAME.  It can't work because mailbox names can be
   literals and can include "]".  Functionality can be addressed via
   referrals.

   is closed instead of immediately closing on a BYE.

   89) Change <a href="rfc822.html">RFC-822</a> references to <a href="rfc2822.html">RFC-2822</a>.

   90) Clarify that <a href="rfc2822.html">RFC-2822</a> should be followed instead of <a href="rfc822.html">RFC-822</a>.

   91) Change recommendation of optional automatic capabilities in LOGIN
   and AUTHENTICATE to use the CAPABILITY response code in the tagged
   OK.  This is more interoperable than an unsolicited untagged
   CAPABILITY response.

   92) STARTTLS and AUTH=PLAIN are mandatory to implement; add
   recommendations for other [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>] mechanisms.

   93) Clarify that a "connection" (as opposed to "server" or "command")
   is in one of the four states.

   94) Clarify that a failed or rejected command does not change state.

   95) Split references between normative and informative.

   96) Discuss authentication failure issues in security section.

   97) Clarify that a data item is not necessarily of only one data
   type.

   98) Clarify that sequence ranges are independent of order.

   99) Change an example to clarify that superfluous shifts in
   Modified-UTF7 can not be fixed just by omitting the shift.  The
   entire string must be recalculated.

   100) Change Envelope Structure definition since [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] uses
   "envelope" to refer to the [<a href="#ref-SMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>SMTP</a>] envelope and not the envelope data
   that appears in the [<a href="rfc2822.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC-2822</a>] header.

   101) Expand on <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>.HEADER response data vs. BODY[HEADER].

   102) Clarify Logout state semantics, change ASCII art.

   103) Security changes to comply with IESG requirements.

   104) Add definition for body URI.

   105) Break sequence range definition into three rules, with rewritten
   descriptions for each.

   106) Move STARTTLS and LOGINDISABLED here from [<a href="#ref-IMAP-TLS" title='"Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP"'>IMAP-TLS</a>].

   107) Add IANA Considerations section.

   108) Clarify valid client assumptions for new message UIDs vs.
   UIDNEXT.

   109) Clarify that changes to permanentflags affect concurrent
   sessions as well as subsequent sessions.

   110) Clarify that authenticated state can be entered by the CLOSE
   command.

   111) Emphasize that SELECT and EXAMINE are the exceptions to the rule
   that a failing command does not change state.

   112) Clarify that newly-appended messages have the Recent flag set.

   113) Clarify that newly-copied messages SHOULD have the Recent flag
   set.

   114) Clarify that UID commands always return the UID in FETCH
   responses.
