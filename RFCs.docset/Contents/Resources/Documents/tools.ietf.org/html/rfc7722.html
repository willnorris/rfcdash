   The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>]
   (OLSRv2) is a proactive link state routing protocol designed for use
   in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) [<a href="rfc2501.html" title='"Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET): Routing Protocol Performance Issues and Evaluation Considerations"'>RFC2501</a>].  One of the significant
   improvements of OLSRv2 over its Experimental precursor [<a href="rfc3626.html" title='"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)"'>RFC3626</a>] is
   the ability of OLSRv2 to use link metrics to select routes other than
   minimum hop routes.

   A limitation that remains in OLSRv2 is that it uses a single link
   metric type for all routes.  However, in some MANETs it would be
   desirable to be able to route packets using more than one link metric
   type.  This specification describes an extension to OLSRv2 that is
   designed to permit this, while maintaining maximal interoperability
   with OLSRv2 routers not implementing this extension.

   The purpose of OLSRv2 can be described as to create and maintain a
   Routing Set, which contains all the necessary information to populate
   an IP routing table.  In a similar way, the role of this extension
   can be described as to create and maintain multiple Routing Sets, one

   Multi-topology routing is a natural extension to a link state routing
   protocol, such as OSPF (see [<a href="rfc4915.html" title='"Multi-Topology (MT) Routing in OSPF"'>RFC4915</a>]).  However multi-topology
   routing for OLSRv2 does not yet benefit from extensive operational,
   or even experimental, experience.  This specification is published to
   facilitate collecting such experience, with the intent that once
   suitable experimental evidence has been collected, an OLSRv2 Multi-
   Topology Routing Extension will be proposed for advancement onto the
   Standards Track.

   Any experiments using this protocol extension are encouraged.
   Reports from such experiments planned with pre-specified objectives
   and scenarios (including link, position, and mobility information)
   are particularly encouraged.  Results from such experiments,
   documenting the following, are of particular importance:

   o  Operation in networks that contain both routers implementing this
      extension and routers implementing only [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>].  In particular,
      are there any unexpected interactions that can break the network?

   o  Operation in networks with dynamic topologies, both due to
      mobility and due to link metric changes for reasons other than
      mobility.

   o  Operation in realistic deployments, and details thereof, including
      how many concurrent topologies were required.

   o  Behavior of Routing Sets, including measures of successful route
      establishment.

   In addition, reports from experiments covering the following are also
   of value:

   o  Which link metric types were useful, and how the metrics to
      associate with a given link were established.

   o  How packet types were associated with link metric types (whether
      using Diffserv or an alternative mechanism).

   o  Any data link-layer issues, and any cross-layer issues, including
      whether and how Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) link
      quality was used.

   o  Transport- and higher-layer issues observed, if any.

   o  Resource requirements observed from running the protocol,
      including processing, storage, and bandwidth.

   o  Network performance, including packet delivery results.

   o  Any other implementation issues.

   The first bullet in the list directly above applies to unextended
   OLSRv2 [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>] as well as with this extension, and potentially to
   other MANET routing protocols.  This specification also allows
   experimentation with link metric types that are not compromises for
   handling multiple traffic types.

   MT-OLSRv2 -  The protocol defined in this specification as an
      extension to OLSRv2 [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>].

   This specification introduces the notation map[A -&gt; B] to represent
   an associative mapping.  The domain of this mapping (A) is, in this
   specification, always a set of link metric types that the router
   supports: either IFACE_METRIC_TYPES or ROUTER_METRIC_TYPES, as
   defined in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  The codomain of this mapping (B) is a set of
   all possible values of an appropriate type.  In this specification,
   this type is always one of:

   o  boolean (true or false),

   o  willingness (a 4-bit unsigned integer from 0 to 15),

   o  number of hops (an 8-bit unsigned integer from 0 to 255), or

   o  link metric (either a representable link metric value, as
      described in [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>], or UNKNOWN_METRIC).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Applicability%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Applicability Statement</span>

   The protocol described in this specification is applicable to a MANET
   for which OLSRv2 is otherwise applicable (see <a href="rfc7181.html#section-3">[RFC7181], Section 3</a>),
   but in which multiple topologies are maintained, each characterized
   by a different choice of link metric type.  It is assumed, but
   outside the scope of this specification, that the network layer is
   able to choose which topology to use for each packet, for example,
   using the Diffserv Code Point (DSCP) defined in [<a href="rfc2474.html" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>RFC2474</a>].  This
   selection of topology MUST be consistent; that is, each router
   receiving a packet must make the same choice of link metric type, in
   order that each packet uses a single topology.  This is necessary to
   avoid the possibility of a packet "looping" in the network.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Protocol%20Overview%20and%20Functioning"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Protocol Overview and Functioning</span>

   The purpose of this specification is to extend OLSRv2 [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>] so as
   to enable a router to establish and maintain multiple routing
   topologies in a MANET, each topology associated with a link metric
   type.  Routers in the MANET may each form part of some or all of
   these topologies, and each router will maintain a Routing Set for
   each topology that it forms part of, allowing separate routing of
   packets for each topology.

   MT-OLSRv2 is designed to interoperate with OLSRv2; a MANET can be
   created containing both routers that implement MT-OLSRv2 (MT-OLSRv2
   routers) and routers that do not implement MT-OLSRv2 and may be
   unaware of its existence (non-MT-OLSRv2 routers).  MANETs may also be

   created that are known to contain only MT-OLSRv2 routers.  In both
   cases, but especially where a MANET contains both MT-OLSRv2 routers
   and non-MT-OLSRv2 routers, management may be required to ensure that
   the MANET will function as required, and will not, for example,
   unnecessarily fragment.  (Such issues already arise in an
   OLSRv2-based MANET using multiple interfaces.)

   OLSRv2 is an extension of NHDP [<a href="rfc6130.html" title='"Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)"'>RFC6130</a>].  However, the extension in
   this specification does not modify NHDP, it only modifies Protocol
   Sets that are specific to OLSRv2, or elements in Protocol Tuples that
   were added by OLSRv2 and that are neither included in nor used by
   NHDP.  In addition it does not use or modify the link quality
   mechanism in [<a href="rfc6130.html" title='"Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)"'>RFC6130</a>].

   Each router implementing this specification selects a set of link
   metric types for each of its OLSRv2 interfaces.  If all routers in
   the MANET implement MT-OLSRv2, then there are no restrictions within
   this specification on how these sets of link metrics are selected.
   (However, the issues described in the preceding paragraph still
   apply.)  On the other hand, in MANETs containing non-MT-OLSRv2
   routers, the single link metric used by these non-MT-OLSRv2 routers
   must be included in the set of link metrics for each OLSRv2 interface
   of an MT-OLSRv2 router that may be heard on an OLSRv2 interface of a
   non-MT-OLSRv2 router in the MANET.

   Each router then determines an incoming link metric for each link
   metric type selected for each of its OLSRv2 interfaces.  These link
   metrics are distributed using link metric TLVs contained in all HELLO
   messages sent on OLSRv2 interfaces and in all TC messages.  Unless
   using only the single metric type used by non-MT-OLSRv2 routers, both
   HELLO and TC messages generated by an MT-OLSRv2 router include an
   MPR_TYPES Message TLV that indicates that this is an MT-OLSRv2 router
   and which metric types it supports (on the sending OLSRv2 interface
   for a HELLO message).

   An MT-OLSRv2 router maintains, for each supported neighbour metric
   type and for each symmetric 1-hop neighbor, the following:

      o  link and neighbour metric values,

      o  routing MPR status,

      o  routing MPR selector status, and

      o  advertised neighbour status.

   Each router may choose a different willingness to be a routing MPR
   for each link metric type that it supports.

   A network using MT-OLSRv2 will usually require greater management
   than one using unmodified OLSRv2.  In particular, the use of multiple
   metric types across the MANET must be managed, by administrative
   configuration or otherwise.  As also for other decisions that may be
   made when using OLSRv2, a bad collective choice of metric type use
   will make the MANET anywhere from inefficient to nonfunctional, so
   care will be needed in selecting supported link metric types across
   the MANET.

   The meanings of link metric types are at the discretion of the MANET
   operator.  They could be used, for example, to represent packets of
   different types, packets in streams of different rates, or packets
   with different trust requirements.  Note that packets will generally
   not be delivered to routers that do not support that link metric
   type, and the MANET, and the packets sent in it, will need to be
   managed accordingly (especially if the MANET contains any
   non-MT-OLSRv2 routers).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Parameters</span>

   The parameters used in [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>], and in its normative references,
   are used in this specification with the following changes.

   Each OLSRv2 interface will support a number of link metric types,
   corresponding to Type Extensions of the LINK_METRIC TLV defined in
   [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>].  The router parameter LINK_METRIC_TYPE, used by routers
   that do not implement MT-OLSRv2, and used with that definition in
   this specification, is replaced in routers implementing MT-OLSRv2 by
   an interface parameter array IFACE_METRIC_TYPES and a router
   parameter array ROUTER_METRIC_TYPES.  Each element in these arrays is
   a link metric type (i.e., a type extension used by the LINK_METRIC
   TLV [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>]).

   The interface parameter array IFACE_METRIC_TYPES contains the link
   metric types supported on that OLSRv2 interface.  The router
   parameter array ROUTER_METRIC_TYPES is the union of all of the
   IFACE_METRIC_TYPES.  Both arrays MUST be without repetitions.

   If in a given deployment there might be routers that do not implement
   MT-OLSRv2, then IFACE_METRIC_TYPES MUST include LINK_METRIC_TYPE as
   its first element, so that the OLSRv2 interface can communicate with
   those routers.  In that case, ROUTER_METRIC_TYPES MUST also include
   LINK_METRIC_TYPE as its first element.

   In addition, the router parameter WILL_ROUTING is extended to an
   array of values, one each for each link metric type in the router
   parameter list ROUTER_METRIC_TYPES.

   the TLVs defined in [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.%20%20Message%20TLVs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1" name="section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Message TLVs</span>

   One new Message TLV is defined in this specification, and one
   existing Message TLV is extended by this specification.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.1.1.%20%20MPR_TYPES%20TLV"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.1.1" name="section-7.1.1">7.1.1</a>.  MPR_TYPES TLV</span>

   The MPR_TYPES TLV is used in both HELLO messages sent over OLSRv2
   interfaces and TC messages.  A message MUST NOT contain more than one
   MPR_TYPES TLV.

   The presence of this TLV in a message is used to indicate that the
   router supports MT-OLSRv2, in the same way that the presence of the
   MPR_WILLING TLV is used to indicate that the router supports OLSRv2,
   as specified in [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>].  For this reason, the MPR_TYPES TLV has
   been defined with the same Type as the MPR_WILLING TLV, but with Type
   Extension = 1.

   This TLV may take a Value field of any size.  Each octet in its Value
   field will contain a link metric type that is supported, either on
   any OLSRv2 interface, when included in a TC message, or on the OLSRv2
   interface on which a HELLO message including this TLV is sent.  These
   octets MAY be in any order, but if there might be routers in the
   MANET that do not implement MT-OLSRv2, then the first octet MUST be
   LINK_METRIC_TYPE.

   The MPR_WILLING TLV, which is used in HELLO messages, is specified in
   [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>], and extended in this specification as enabled by

   willingness to be a flooding TLV, and bits 4-7 of its Value field to
   be a routing TLV.  Those latter bits are, when using this
   specification, interpreted as its willingness to be a routing TLV
   using the link metric type LINK_METRIC_TYPE.

   The extended use of this message TLV, as defined by this
   specification, defines additional 4-bit sub-fields of the Value
   field, starting with bits 4-7 of the first octet and continuing with
   bits 0-3 of the second octet, to represent willingness to be a
   routing MPR using the link metric types specified in this OLSRv2
   interface's IFACE_METRIC_TYPES parameter, ordered as reported in the
   included MPR_TYPES Message TLV.  Note that this means that, if there
   might be any non-MT-OLSRv2 routers, then the link metric type
   LINK_METRIC_TYPE will continue to occupy bits 4-7 of the first octet.
   (If there is no such TLV included, then the router does not support
   MT-OLSRv2, and only the first octet of the Value field will be used.)

   If the number of link metric types in this OLSRv2 interface's
   IFACE_METRIC_TYPES parameter is even, then there will be an unused
   4-bit sub-field in bits 4-7 of the last octet of a full-sized Value
   field.  These bits will not be used; they SHOULD all be cleared ('0')
   on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   If the Value field in an MPR_WILLING TLV is shorter than its full
   length, then, as specified in [<a href="rfc7188.html" title='"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2) and MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) Extension TLVs"'>RFC7188</a>], missing Value octets, i.e.,
   missing willingness values, are considered as zero (WILL_NEVER).
   This is the correct behavior.  (In particular, it means that an
   OLSRv2 router that is not implementing MT-OLSRv2 will not act as a
   routing MPR for any link metric that it does not recognize.)

   The MPR TLV is used in HELLO messages and indicates that an address
   with which it is associated is of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor that has
   been selected as an MPR.

   The Value field of this address block TLV is, in [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>], defined
   to be one octet long, with the values 1, 2, and 3 defined.  [<a href="rfc7188.html" title='"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2) and MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) Extension TLVs"'>RFC7188</a>]
   redefines this Value field to be a bitfield where bit 7 (the least
   significant bit) denotes flooding status, bit 6 denotes routing MPR
   status, and bits 5-0 are unallocated (respecting the semantics of the
   bits/values 1, 2, and 3 from [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>]).

   This specification, as enabled by [<a href="rfc7188.html" title='"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2) and MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) Extension TLVs"'>RFC7188</a>], extends the MPR TLV to
   have a variable-length Value field.  Bits are allocated in increasing
   significance within as many octets as are required.  These bits
   specify, in order, that:

   o  The neighbor with that network address has been selected as
      flooding MPR  (1 bit).

   o  The neighbor with that network address has been selected as
      routing MPR for each link metric type (1 bit each), in the same
      order as indicated in the Value field of an MPR_TYPES Message TLV.

   For interoperability with a router not implementing MT-OLSRv2, the
   two least significant bits of the first octet in the Value field of
   this TLV is as the TLV Value of an MPR TLV generated according to
   [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>], as updated by [<a href="rfc7188.html" title='"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2) and MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) Extension TLVs"'>RFC7188</a>].

   The GATEWAY TLV is used in TC messages to indicate that a network
   address is of an attached network.

   The Value field of this address block TLV is defined by [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>] to
   be one octet long, containing the number of hops to that attached
   network.

   This specification, as enabled by [<a href="rfc7188.html" title='"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2) and MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) Extension TLVs"'>RFC7188</a>], allows the extension of
   the GATEWAY TLV to have a variable-length Value field when the number
   of hops to each attached network is different for different link
   metric types.  For interoperability with a router not implementing
   MT-OLSRv2, the first octet in the Value field of this TLV MUST be the
   TLV Value of the GATEWAY TLV generated according to [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>].

   Any subsequent octets in the TLV Value field indicate the number of

   On receipt of a HELLO message on an OLSRv2 interface, a router
   implementing MT-OLSRv2 MUST do the following, in addition to the
   processing described in [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>]:

   1.  If in this deployment there might be routers that do not

       Message TLV, and the first link metric type that it reports is
       not LINK_METRIC_TYPE, then the HELLO message MUST be silently
       discarded.

   2.  Determine the list of link metric types supported by the sending
       router on its corresponding OLSRv2 interface, either from an
       MPR_TYPES Message TLV (if present) or from the single link metric
       type LINK_METRIC_TYPE.

   3.  For all link metric types reported and supported by the receiving

       N_out_metric, N_will_routing, N_mpr_selector, N_advertised,
       N2_in_metric, and N2_out_metric elements using the rules for
       setting the single elements of those types specified in
       [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>].

   4.  For any other metric types supported by the receiving router only
       (i.e. in IFACE_METRIC for the receiving OLSRv2 interface), set
       the elements listed in the previous point to their default

   o  For all link metric types reported and supported by the receiving

      AN_metric elements using the rules for setting the single elements
      of those types specified in [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>].

   o  For any other metric types supported by the receiving router that

   Routing MPRs are calculated for each link metric type in
   ROUTER_METRIC_TYPES.  Links to symmetric 1-hop neighbors via OLSRv2
   interfaces that do not support that link metric type are not
   considered.  The determined status (routing MPR or not routing MPR)
   for each link metric type is recorded in the relevant element of
   N_routing_mpr.

   Each router may make its own decision as to whether or not to use a
   link metric, or link metrics, for flooding MPR calculation.  If using
   link metric(s), each router decides which one(s) and how they are
   used.  These decisions MUST be made in a manner that ensures that
   flooded messages will reach the same symmetric 2-hop neighbors as
   would be the case for a router not supporting MT-OLSRv2.

   Note that it is possible that a 2-Hop Tuple in the Information Base
   for a given OLSRv2 interface does not support any of the link metric
   types that are in the router's corresponding IFACE_METRIC_TYPES;
   nevertheless, that 2-Hop Tuple MUST be considered when determining
   flooding MPRs.

   MT-OLSRv2 may require greater management than unextended OLSRv2.  In
   particular, a MANET using MT-OLSRv2 requires the following management
   considerations:

   o  Deciding which link metric, and hence which Routing Set to use,
      for received packets, hence how to use the Routing Sets to
      configure the network layer (IP).  All routers MUST make the same
      decision for the same packet.  An obvious approach is to map each
      DSCP [<a href="rfc2474.html" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>RFC2474</a>] to a single link metric.  (This may be a many-to-
      one mapping.)

   o  Selecting which link metrics to support on each OLSRv2 interface
      and implementing that decision.  (Different interfaces may have
      different physical and data link-layer properties, and this may
      inform the selection of link metrics to support, and their
      values.)  If the MANET might contain non-MT-OLSRv2 routers, which
      are also subject to management, then the rules in this
      specification for link metric assignment to OLSRv2 interfaces for
      that case MUST be followed.

   o  Ensuring that the MANET is sufficiently connected, by ensuring
      that, for example, sufficiently many routers implement each metric
      type required. (This is easier in, for example, a denser network.)
      Note that if there is any possibility that there are routers not
      implementing MT-OLSRv2, then the MANET will be connected, to the
      maximum extent possible, using the link metric type
      LINK_METRIC_TYPE, but this will only serve to deliver packets that
      use that link metric type.

   o  Non-MT-OLSRv2 routers SHOULD be managed so as not produce packets
      that will be routed by a topology that they are not part of.
      However, if that were to happen, then such packets will be routed
      until either they reach their destination or they reach an
      MT-OLSRv2 router.  In the latter case, the packet then either will
      be dropped (if that MT-OLSRv2 router is not part of that topology,

      or is not aware of the destination within that topology) or will
      be routed by that topology to the destination.  Such a packet will
      not loop.

   o  If a packet is created for a destination that is not part of the
      corresponding topology, then it may or may not be delivered (if
      the originating router is a non-MT-OLSRv2 router) or will not be
      sent (if the originating router is an MT-OLSRv2 router).  Routers
      SHOULD be managed so that topologies are as complete as possible
      and that packets are not sent if they may not be delivered.  In
      particular, non-MT-OLSRv2 routers SHOULD only send packets that
      will be routed using the topology using the link metric type

   This extension to OLSRv2 allows a router to support more than one
   link metric type for each link advertised in HELLO and TC messages,
   and for routers to support different sets of types.  Link metric
   values of additional types are reported by the inclusion of
   additional TLVs in the messages sent by a router, which will report
   known values of all supported types.

   HELLO and TC message processing is then extended simply to record,
   for each supported type, all of the received link metric values for
   each link.  Protocol-internal processing (specifically, MPR set and
   shortest path calculations) then operates as specified in [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>]
   for each link metric type that the router supports.

   Consequently, the security considerations, including the security
   architecture and the mandatory security mechanisms, from [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>]
   are directly applicable to MT-OLSRv2.

   Furthermore, this extension does not introduce any additional
   vulnerabilities beyond those of [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>], because each link metric
   type is used independently, and each one could have been the single
   link metric type supported by an implementation of [<a href="rfc7181.html" title='"The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2"'>RFC7181</a>]
   receiving the same information, as received information of an
   unsupported type is ignored by all routers.
