<meta content="This memo discusses the applicability of &quot;Extensions to RSVP for LSP
Tunnels&quot; [1]. It highlights the protocol's principles of operation
and describes the network context for which it was designed.
Guidelines for deployment are offered and known protocol limitations
are indicated. This document is intended to accompany the submission
of &quot;Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels&quot; onto the Internet standards
track.  1.0 Introduction  Service providers and users have indicated
that there is a great need for traffic engineering capabilities in IP
networks. These traffic engineering capabilities can be based on
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and can be implemented on label
switching routers (LSRs) from different vendors that interoperate
using a common signaling and label distribution protocol. A
description of the requirements for traffic engineering in MPLS based
IP networks can be found in [2]. There is, therefore, a requirement
for an open, non- proprietary, standards based signaling and label
distribution protocol for the MPLS traffic engineering application
that will allow label switching routers from different vendors to
interoperate.  The &quot;Extensions to RSVP for LSP tunnels&quot; (RSVP-TE)
specification [1] was developed by the IETF MPLS working group to
address this requirement. RSVP-TE is a composition of several related
proposals submitted to the IETF MPLS working group. It contains all
the necessary objects, packet formats, and procedures required to
establish and maintain explicit label switched paths (LSPs). Explicit
LSPs are foundational to the traffic engineering application in MPLS
based IP networks. Besides the traffic engineering application, the
RSVP-TE specification may have other uses within the Internet.  This
memo describes the applicability of the RSVP-TE specifications [1].
The protocol's principles of operation are highlighted, the network
context for which it was developed is described, guidelines for
deployment are offered, and known protocol limitations are indicated.
This applicability statement concerns only the use of RSVP to set up
unicast LSP-tunnels. It is noted that not all of the features
described in RFC2205 [3] are required to support the instantiation and
maintenance of LSP-tunnels. Aspects related to the support of other
features and capabilities of RSVP by an implementation that also
supports LSP-tunnels are beyond the scope of this document. However,
support of such additional features and capabilities should not
introduce new security vulnerabilities in environments that only use
RSVP to set up LSP-tunnels.  This applicability statement does not
preclude the use of other signaling and label distribution protocols
for the traffic engineering application in MPLS based networks.
Service providers are free to deploy whatever signaling protocol that
meets their needs.  In particular, CR-LDP [7] and RSVP-TE [1] are two
signaling protocols that perform similar functions in MPLS networks.
There is currently no consensus on which protocol is technically
superior. Therefore, network administrators should make a choice
between the two based upon their needs and particular situation.   2.0
Technical Overview of Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels  The RSVP-TE
specification extends the original RSVP protocol by giving it new
capabilities that support the following functions in an MPLS domain:
(1) downstream-on-demand label distribution (2) instantiation of
explicit label switched paths (3) allocation of network resources
(e.g., bandwidth) to explicit LSPs (4) rerouting of established LSP-
tunnels in a smooth fashion using the concept of make-before-break (5)
tracking of the actual route traversed by an LSP-tunnel (6)
diagnostics on LSP-tunnels (7) the concept of nodal abstraction (8)
preemption options that are administratively controllable  The RSVP-TE
specification introduces several new RSVP objects, including the
LABEL-REQUEST object, the RECORD-ROUTE object, the LABEL object, the
EXPLICIT-ROUTE object, and new SESSION objects. New error messages are
defined to provide notification of exception conditions. All of the
new objects defined in RSVP-TE are optional with respect to the RSVP
protocol, except the LABEL-REQUEST and LABEL objects, which are both
mandatory for the establishment of LSP- tunnels.  Two fundamental
aspects distinguish the RSVP-TE specification [1] from the original
RSVP protocol [3].  The first distinguishing aspect is the fact that
the RSVP-TE specification [1] is intended for use by label switching
routers (as well as hosts) to establish and maintain LSP-tunnels and
to reserve network resources for such LSP-tunnels. The original RSVP
specification [3], on the other hand, was intended for use by hosts to
request and reserve network resources for micro-flows.  The second
distinguishing aspect is the fact that the RSVP-TE specification
generalizes the concept of &quot;RSVP flow.&quot; The RSVP-TE specification
essentially allows an RSVP session to consist of an arbitrary
aggregation of traffic (based on local policies) between the
originating node of an LSP-tunnel and the egress node of the tunnel.
To be definite, in the original RSVP protocol [3], a session was
defined as a data flow with a particular destination and transport
layer protocol. In the RSVP-TE specification, however, a session is
implicitly defined as the set of packets that are assigned the same
MPLS label value at the originating node of an LSP-tunnel. The
assignment of labels to packets can be based on various criteria, and
may even encompass all packets (or subsets thereof) between the
endpoints of the LSP-tunnel. Because traffic is aggregated, the number
of LSP-tunnels (hence the number of RSVP sessions) does not increase
proportionally with the number of flows in the network. Therefore, the
RSVP-TE specification [1] addresses a major scaling issue with the
original RSVP protocol [3], namely the large amount of system
resources that would otherwise be required to manage reservations and
maintain state for potentially thousands or even millions of RSVP
sessions at the micro-flow granularity.  The reader is referred to [1]
for a technical description of the RSVP-TE protocol specification.
3.0 Applicability of Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels  Use of RSVP-
TE is appropriate in contexts where it is useful to establish and
maintain explicit label switched paths in an MPLS network. LSP-tunnels
may be instantiated for measurement purposes and/or for routing
control purposes. They may also be instantiated for other
administrative reasons.  For the measurement application, an LSP-
tunnel can be used to capture various path statistics between its
endpoints. This can be accomplished by associating various performance
management and fault management functions with an LSP-tunnel, such as
packet and byte counters. For example, an LSP-tunnel can be
instantiated, with or without bandwidth allocation, solely for the
purpose of monitoring traffic flow statistics between two label
switching routers.  For the routing control application, LSP-tunnels
can be used to forward subsets of traffic through paths that are
independent of routes computed by conventional Interior Gateway
Protocol (IGP) Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithms. This feature
introduces significant flexibility into the routing function and
allows policies to be implemented that can result in the performance
optimization of operational networks. For example, using LSP-tunnels,
traffic can be routed away from congested network resources onto
relatively underutilized ones. More generally, load balancing policies
can be actualized that increase the effective capacity of the network.
To further enhance the control application, RSVP-TE may be augmented
with an ancillary constraint-based routing entity. This entity may
compute explicit routes based on certain traffic attributes, while
taking network constraints into account. Additionally, IGP link state
advertisements may be extended to propagate new topology state
information. This information can be used by the constraint-based
routing entity to compute feasible routes. Furthermore, the IGP
routing algorithm may itself be enhanced to take pre-established LSP-
tunnels into consideration while building the routing table. All these
augmentations are useful, but not mandatory. In fact, the RSVP-TE
specification may be deployed in certain contexts without any of these
additional components.  The capability to monitor point to point
traffic statistics between two routers and the capability to control
the forwarding paths of subsets of traffic through a given network
topology together make the RSVP-TE specifications applicable and
useful for traffic engineering within service provider networks.
These capabilities also make the RSVP-TE applicable, in some contexts,
as a component of an MPLS based VPN provisioning framework.  It is
significant that the MPLS architecture [4] states clearly that no
single label distribution protocol is assumed for the MPLS technology.
Therefore, as noted in the introduction, this applicability statement
does not (and should not be construed to) prevent a label switching
router from implementing other signaling and label distribution
protocols that also support establishment of explicit LSPs and traffic
engineering in MPLS networks.   4.0 Deployment and Policy
Considerations  When deploying RSVP-TE, there should be well defined
administrative policies governing the selection of nodes that will
serve as endpoints for LSP-tunnels. Furthermore, when devising a
virtual topology for LSP-tunnels, special consideration should be
given to the tradeoff between the operational complexity associated
with a large number of LSP-tunnels and the control granularity that
large numbers of LSP-tunnels allow. Stated otherwise, a large number
of LSP-tunnels allows greater control over the distribution of traffic
across the network, but increases network operational complexity. In
large networks, it may be advisable to start with a simple LSP-tunnel
virtual topology and then introduce additional complexity based on
observed or anticipated traffic flow patterns.  Administrative
policies may also guide the amount of bandwidth to be allocated (if
any) to each LSP-tunnel. Policies of this type may take into
consideration empirical traffic statistics derived from the
operational network in addition to other factors.  5.0 Limitations
The RSVP-TE specification supports only unicast LSP-tunnels. Multicast
LSP-tunnels are not supported.  The RSVP-TE specification supports
only unidirectional LSP- tunnels. Bidirectional LSP-tunnels are not
supported.  The soft state nature of RSVP remains a source of concern
because of the need to generate refresh messages periodically to
maintain the state of established LSP-tunnels. This issue is addressed
in several proposals that have been submitted to the RSVP working
group (see e.g. [6]).   6.0 Conclusion  The applicability of the
&quot;Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels&quot; specification has been discussed
in this document. The specification introduced several enhancements to
the RSVP protocol, which make it applicable in contexts in which the
original RSVP protocol would have been inappropriate. One context in
which the RSVP-TE specification is particularly applicable is in
traffic engineering in MPLS based IP networks.  7.0 Security
Considerations  This document does not introduce new security issues.
The RSVP-TE specification adds new opaque objects to RSVP. Therefore,
the security considerations pertaining to the original RSVP protocol
remain relevant. When deployed in service provider networks, it is
mandatory to ensure that only authorized entities are permitted to
initiate establishment of LSP-tunnels.    8.0 Acknowledgments  The

   Service providers and users have indicated that there is a great need
   for traffic engineering capabilities in IP networks.  These traffic
   engineering capabilities can be based on Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) and can be implemented on label switching routers
   (LSRs) from different vendors that interoperate using a common
   signaling and label distribution protocol.  A description of the
   requirements for traffic engineering in MPLS based IP networks can be
   found in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Requirements for Traffic Engineering Over MPLS,"'>2</a>].  There is, therefore, a requirement for an open, non-
   proprietary, standards based signaling and label distribution
   protocol for the MPLS traffic engineering application that will allow
   label switching routers from different vendors to interoperate.

   The "Extensions to RSVP for LSP tunnels" (RSVP-TE) specification [<a href="#ref-1" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels,"'>1</a>]
   was developed by the IETF MPLS working group to address this
   requirement.  RSVP-TE is a composition of several related proposals

   submitted to the IETF MPLS working group.  It contains all the
   necessary objects, packet formats, and procedures required to
   establish and maintain explicit label switched paths (LSPs).
   Explicit LSPs are foundational to the traffic engineering application
   in MPLS based IP networks.  Besides the traffic engineering
   application, the RSVP-TE specification may have other uses within the
   Internet.

   This memo describes the applicability of the RSVP-TE specifications
   [<a href="#ref-1" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels,"'>1</a>].  The protocol's principles of operation are highlighted, the
   network context for which it was developed is described, guidelines
   for deployment are offered, and known protocol limitations are
   indicated.

   This applicability statement concerns only the use of RSVP to set up
   unicast LSP-tunnels.  It is noted that not all of the features
   described in <a href="rfc2205.html">RFC2205</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1, Functional Specification"'>3</a>] are required to support the instantiation
   and maintenance of LSP-tunnels.  Aspects related to the support of
   other features and capabilities of RSVP by an implementation that
   also supports LSP-tunnels are beyond the scope of this document.
   However, support of such additional features and capabilities should
   not introduce new security vulnerabilities in environments that only
   use RSVP to set up LSP-tunnels.

   This applicability statement does not preclude the use of other
   signaling and label distribution protocols for the traffic
   engineering application in MPLS based networks.  Service providers
   are free to deploy whatever signaling protocol that meets their
   needs.

   In particular, CR-LDP [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Constraint-Based LSP Setup using LDP,"'>6</a>] and RSVP-TE [<a href="#ref-1" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels,"'>1</a>] are two signaling protocols
   that perform similar functions in MPLS networks.  There is currently
   no consensus on which protocol is technically superior.  Therefore,
   network administrators should make a choice between the two based
   upon their needs and particular situation.

   The RSVP-TE specification extends the original RSVP protocol by
   giving it new capabilities that support the following functions in an
   MPLS domain:

     (1) downstream-on-demand label distribution
     (2) instantiation of explicit label switched paths
     (3) allocation of network resources (e.g., bandwidth) to
         explicit LSPs
     (4) rerouting of established LSP-tunnels in a smooth fashion
         using the concept of make-before-break



<span class="grey">Awduche, et. al.             Informational                      [Page 2]</span></pre>

     (5) tracking of the actual route traversed by an LSP-tunnel
     (6) diagnostics on LSP-tunnels
     (7) the concept of nodal abstraction
     (8) preemption options that are administratively controllable

   The RSVP-TE specification introduces several new RSVP objects,
   including the LABEL-REQUEST object, the RECORD-ROUTE object, the
   LABEL object, the EXPLICIT-ROUTE object, and new SESSION objects.
   New error messages are defined to provide notification of exception
   conditions.  All of the new objects defined in RSVP-TE are optional
   with respect to the RSVP protocol, except the LABEL-REQUEST and LABEL
   objects, which are both mandatory for the establishment of LSP-
   tunnels.

   Two fundamental aspects distinguish the RSVP-TE specification [<a href="#ref-1" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels,"'>1</a>]
   from the original RSVP protocol [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1, Functional Specification"'>3</a>].

   The first distinguishing aspect is the fact that the RSVP-TE
   specification [<a href="#ref-1" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels,"'>1</a>] is intended for use by label switching routers (as
   well as hosts) to establish and maintain LSP-tunnels and to reserve
   network resources for such LSP-tunnels.  The original RSVP
   specification [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1, Functional Specification"'>3</a>], on the other hand, was intended for use by hosts
   to request and reserve network resources for micro-flows.

   The second distinguishing aspect is the fact that the RSVP-TE
   specification generalizes the concept of "RSVP flow." The RSVP-TE
   specification essentially allows an RSVP session to consist of an
   arbitrary aggregation of traffic (based on local policies) between
   the originating node of an LSP-tunnel and the egress node of the
   tunnel.  To be definite, in the original RSVP protocol [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1, Functional Specification"'>3</a>], a session
   was defined as a data flow with a particular destination and
   transport layer protocol.  In the RSVP-TE specification, however, a
   session is implicitly defined as the set of packets that are assigned
   the same MPLS label value at the originating node of an LSP-tunnel.
   The assignment of labels to packets can be based on various criteria,
   and may even encompass all packets (or subsets thereof) between the
   endpoints of the LSP-tunnel.  Because traffic is aggregated, the
   number of LSP-tunnels (hence the number of RSVP sessions) does not
   increase proportionally with the number of flows in the network.
   Therefore, the RSVP-TE specification [<a href="#ref-1" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels,"'>1</a>] addresses a major scaling
   issue with the original RSVP protocol [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1, Functional Specification"'>3</a>], namely the large amount of
   system resources that would otherwise be required to manage
   reservations and maintain state for potentially thousands or even
   millions of RSVP sessions at the micro-flow granularity.

   The reader is referred to [<a href="#ref-1" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels,"'>1</a>] for a technical description of the
   RSVP-TE protocol specification.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.0%20Applicability%20of%20Extensions%20to%20RSVP%20for%20LSP%20Tunnels"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.0" name="section-3.0">3.0</a> Applicability of Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels</span>

   Use of RSVP-TE is appropriate in contexts where it is useful to
   establish and maintain explicit label switched paths in an MPLS
   network.  LSP-tunnels may be instantiated for measurement purposes
   and/or for routing control purposes.  They may also be instantiated
   for other administrative reasons.

   For the measurement application, an LSP-tunnel can be used to capture
   various path statistics between its endpoints.  This can be
   accomplished by associating various performance management and fault
   management functions with an LSP-tunnel, such as packet and byte
   counters.  For example, an LSP-tunnel can be instantiated, with or
   without bandwidth allocation, solely for the purpose of monitoring
   traffic flow statistics between two label switching routers.

   For the routing control application, LSP-tunnels can be used to
   forward subsets of traffic through paths that are independent of
   routes computed by conventional Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
   Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithms.  This feature introduces
   significant flexibility into the routing function and allows policies
   to be implemented that can result in the performance optimization of
   operational networks.  For example, using LSP-tunnels, traffic can be
   routed away from congested network resources onto relatively
   underutilized ones.  More generally, load balancing policies can be
   actualized that increase the effective capacity of the network.

   To further enhance the control application, RSVP-TE may be augmented
   with an ancillary constraint-based routing entity.  This entity may
   compute explicit routes based on certain traffic attributes, while
   taking network constraints into account.  Additionally, IGP link
   state advertisements may be extended to propagate new topology state
   information.  This information can be used by the constraint-based
   routing entity to compute feasible routes.  Furthermore, the IGP
   routing algorithm may itself be enhanced to take pre-established
   LSP-tunnels into consideration while building the routing table.  All
   these augmentations are useful, but not mandatory.  In fact, the
   RSVP-TE specification may be deployed in certain contexts without any
   of these additional components.

   The capability to monitor point to point traffic statistics between
   two routers and the capability to control the forwarding paths of
   subsets of traffic through a given network topology together make the
   RSVP-TE specifications applicable and useful for traffic engineering
   within service provider networks.

   These capabilities also make the RSVP-TE applicable, in some
   contexts, as a component of an MPLS based VPN provisioning framework.

   It is significant that the MPLS architecture [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A Proposed Architecture for MPLS"'>4</a>] states clearly that
   no single label distribution protocol is assumed for the MPLS
   technology.  Therefore, as noted in the introduction, this
   applicability statement does not (and should not be construed to)
   prevent a label switching router from implementing other signaling
   and label distribution protocols that also support establishment of
   explicit LSPs and traffic engineering in MPLS networks.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.0%20Deployment%20and%20Policy%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.0" name="section-4.0">4.0</a> Deployment and Policy Considerations</span>

   When deploying RSVP-TE, there should be well defined administrative
   policies governing the selection of nodes that will serve as
   endpoints for LSP-tunnels.  Furthermore, when devising a virtual
   topology for LSP-tunnels, special consideration should be given to
   the tradeoff between the operational complexity associated with a
   large number of LSP-tunnels and the control granularity that large
   numbers of LSP-tunnels allow.  Stated otherwise, a large number of
   LSP-tunnels allows greater control over the distribution of traffic
   across the network, but increases network operational complexity.  In
   large networks, it may be advisable to start with a simple LSP-tunnel
   virtual topology and then introduce additional complexity based on
   observed or anticipated traffic flow patterns.

   Administrative policies may also guide the amount of bandwidth to be
   allocated (if any) to each LSP-tunnel.  Policies of this type may
   take into consideration empirical traffic statistics derived from the
   operational network in addition to other factors.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.0%20Limitations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.0" name="section-5.0">5.0</a> Limitations</span>

   The RSVP-TE specification supports only unicast LSP-tunnels.
   Multicast LSP-tunnels are not supported.

   The RSVP-TE specification supports only unidirectional LSP-tunnels.
   Bidirectional LSP-tunnels are not supported.

   The soft state nature of RSVP remains a source of concern because of
   the need to generate refresh messages periodically to maintain the
   state of established LSP-tunnels.  This issue is addressed in several
   proposals that have been submitted to the RSVP working group (see
   e.g. [<a href="#ref-5" title='"RSVP Refresh Overhead Reduction Extensions"'>5</a>]).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.0%20Conclusion"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.0" name="section-6.0">6.0</a> Conclusion</span>

   The applicability of the "Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"
   specification has been discussed in this document.  The specification
   introduced several enhancements to the RSVP protocol, which make it

   applicable in contexts in which the original RSVP protocol would have
   been inappropriate.  One context in which the RSVP-TE specification
   is particularly applicable is in traffic engineering in MPLS based IP
   networks.

   This document does not introduce new security issues.  The RSVP-TE
   specification adds new opaque objects to RSVP.  Therefore, the
   security considerations pertaining to the original RSVP protocol
   remain relevant.  When deployed in service provider networks, it is
   mandatory to ensure that only authorized entities are permitted to
   initiate establishment of LSP-tunnels.
