                                PREFACE

   The subroutines described in this document have been implemented at UCSB
   and make the Network (via the NCP) accessible to PL1 programs executing
   in the 360/75.  They are callable from within any PL1 main program or
   subroutine compiled at UCSB.


   A  set  of  assembly-language  written  subprograms  is  provided  to
   facilitate  the use of the Network by PL1 programmers.  They serve as
   an interface between the user and the Network Control Program  (NCP),
   which supervises all Network operations at this site.


   A concept  fundamental  to  PL1  Network  operations  is  that  of  a
   completion code variable.  Associated with each socket that is not in
   the closed state is a  unique  variable,  called  a  completion  code
   variable.   This  variable  serves  two  purposes:  it identifies the
   local socket referenced, and upon  completion  of  the  operation  it
   contains  a  completion code to indicate the outcome of the operation
   to the programmer.  It may be used at any time for any purpose  other
   than  Network  operations.   Its  value at the beginning of a Network
   operation is immaterial;  rather, it is the variable itself  that  is
   important.   In  all  Network  operations, whenever a completion code
   variable is called  for,  the  only  acceptable  attributes  for  the
   variable are BINARY FIXED(31,0)ALIGNED.

   In general, the subprograms will initiate the  operation,  and  enter
   the WAIT state (consume no CPU time) until notified by the NCP of the
   completion of the operation.  For  such  operations,  the  programmer
   supplies  a  time  limit,  with  attributes BINARY FIXED(31,0), which
   specifies, in tenths of a second, the  maximum  length  of  time  the
   subprogram  is  to  wait for the operation to complete.  If this time
   limit is exceeded, a completion code  is  supplied  to  indicate  the
   error,  and  control  is  returned  to  the calling program, with the
   operation still pending.

   In those operations requiring a socket to be specified by its  socket
   identifier,   the  following  format  is  used.   The  identifier  is
   specified as a BINARY FIXED(31,0) array, singly dimensioned  with  at
   least  two  elements,  and  with a lower subscript bound of one.  The
   first element is taken to be the site number, and the second  element
   the  socket  number.   A  socket number may have any value, positive,
   negative, or zero.  Since negative numbers are represented internally
   in two's complement form, for the purposes of the gender of a socket,
   a socket number is even or odd  according  to  whether  its  absolute
   value is even or odd, respectively.

   Following is a description  of  each  subprogram,  its  function  and
   calling sequence.

(1)  OPEN

     By invoking this subprogram, the user requests that  the  specified
     local  socket be removed from the closed state and thus be prepared
     to  participate  in  data  transfer.   There  are  three   distinct
     operations  that can be performed by this subprogram, and these are
     described below:

     (A)  CONNECT

          By initiating this  operation,  the  user  requests  that  the
          specified local socket be logically connected to the specified
          foreign socket, and that data transfer between the two sockets
          be enabled.  The subprogram will wait until the foreign socket
          either  accepts  or  rejects  the  connection  attempt.   This
          operation  is  valid  only  when  the  socket is in the closed
          state.

          The calling sequence is as follows:

               CALL @OPEN(cmpcd, time,lclsck,fgnsck,ws);

          where

               'cmpcd' is the completion code variable to be associated
                    with the local socket.
               'time' is the length of time the subprogram is to wait
                    for the completion of the operation.
               'lclsck' is the socket identifier of the local socket.
               'fgnsck' is the socket identifier of the foreign socket.
               'ws' is a workspace which has the same attributes as a
                    socket identifier, and, if the operation if
                    successful, will become associated with the local
                    socket for the life of the connection.  In response
                    to certain future operations, information may be
                    returned to the programmer in this workspace.

          The  following  completion  codes  are   possible   for   this
          operation:

               0,  The operation was successful and the connection has
                   been established
               4,  The specified completion code variable is already
                   assigned to a socket;  the operation was suppressed
               8,  The specified local socket is not in the closed

                   state;  the operation was suppressed
              12,  All communication paths to the specified foreign site
                   are in use;  the operation was suppressed
              16,  Local resources are insufficient to support another
                   connection;  the operation was suppressed
              20,  The connection attempt was rejected by the foreign
                   process
              24,  The specified local socket is not local to UCSB;  the
                   operation was suppressed
              28,  The specified foreign site is invalid;  the operation
                   was suppressed
              32,  An addressing or protection exception was encountered
                   with respect to the specified workspace;  the
                   operation was suppressed
              36,  Either hardware at the foreign site is inoperative or
                   the NCP's counterpart at the foreign site does not
                   exist or has failed
              40,  Local and foreign sockets are both either send or
                   receive sockets;  the operation was suppressed
              44,  By operator command, all Network operations were
                   terminated;  the socket will be closed
              60,  An NCP control transmission error occured;  the
                   operation was suppressed
             252,  The specified time limit was exceeded;  the operation
                   was initiated but not completed

     (B)  LISTEN

          This operation is a request for notification of any connection
          attempt  directed  toward  the  specified  local  socket.  The
          subprogram waits until such a call is received, at which  time
          the  calling  process'  socket  identifier  is returned to the
          calling program.   This  operation  is  valid  only  when  the
          designated  local  socket is in the closed state.  The calling
          sequence is as follows:

               CALL @OPEN(cmpcd, time,lclsck,ws);

          where

               'cmpcd' is the completion code variable to be associated
                    with the local socket.
               'time' is the length of time the subprogram is to wait
                    for the completion of the operation.
               'lclsck' is the socket identifier of the local socket.
               'ws' is a workspace which, if the operation is
                    successful, will contain the socket identifier of
                    the calling socket, and will become associated with

     (C)  ACCEPT

          This operation accepts  connection  with  the  foreign  socket
          whose  call  caused successful completion of a previous LISTEN
          operation by the specified local socket.  After completion  of
          this  operation,  data may be transferred to or from the local
          socket, depending on its gender.  This operation is valid only
          when  the  last  operation  referencing the local socket was a
          LISTEN  operation.   The  subprogram  will  wait   until   the
          operation is completed.

          The calling sequence is as follows:

               CALL @OPEN(cmpcd, time);

          where

               'cmpcd' is the completion code variable associated with
                    the local socket by a previous LISTEN operation.
                'time' is the length of time the subprogram is to wait
                    for the completion of the operation.

          The  following  completion  codes  are   possible   for   this
          operation:

                   established
               4,  The specified local socket is in the closed state
                   (the NCP may have received an abort notification from
                   the foreign process);  the operation was suppressed
               8,  The previous operation specifying the designated
                   local socket was not a LISTEN;  the operation was

             252,  The specified time limit was exceeded;  the operation
                   was initiated but not completed

(2)  CLOSE

     This operation is a request that  the  specified  local  socket  be
     returned to the closed state.  If the last operation involving this
     socket was a LISTEN, this operation refuses  the  foreign  process'
     connection  attempt.   If  the  last  operation  was a CONNECT, the
     attempt is aborted.  If a connection is established,  any  data  in
     transit  from  the  local  socket  is  allowed to reach the foreign
     socket and to be either received or flushed before the local socket
     is  closed.   The  subprogram  will  wait until the socket has been
     returned to the closed state.

     The calling sequence is as follows:

          CALL @CLOSE(cmpcd,time);

     where

          'cmpcd' is the completion code variable associated with the
               local socket.
          'time' is the length of time the subprogram is to wait for the
               completion of the operation.

     The following completion codes are possible for this operation:

              initiated but not completed

(3)  SEND

     This operation causes data to be sent to the foreign  socket.   The
     subprogram  will  wait  until  the  data  has  been received by the
     foreign socket, or until it has been queued locally by the NCP.

     The calling sequence is as follows:

          CALL @WRITE(cmpcd, bfr,len,time[,offset]);

     where

          'cmpcd' is the completion code variable associated with the
               local socket.
          'bfr' is the data to be sent, and must be a singly dimensioned
               array, either DECIMAL or BINARY, FIXED or FLOAT.
          'len' is the number of bits of data to be sent.  If 'len' is
               non-positive, no operation is performed.  'len' has the
               attribute BINARY FIXED(31,0).
          'time' is the length of time the subprogram is to wait for the
               completion of the operation.
          'offset' is the bit offset from the first bit of 'bfr' at
               which data transmission is to begin, and must have the
               attributes BINARY FIXED(31,0).  If not specified,
               'offset' defaults to zero.

     The following completion codes are possible for this operation:

          0,  The operation was successful, and the data has been sent
          4,  The specified local socket is not a SEND socket;  the

        252,  The specified time limit was exceeded;  the operation was
              initiated but not completed

(4)  RECEIVE

     This operation causes data to be received from the foreign  socket.
     The subprogram will wait until the reception of data is complete.

     The calling sequence is as follows:

          CALL @READ(cmpcd,bfr,len,time[,offset]);

     where

          'cmpcd' is the completion code variable associated with the
               local socket.
          'bfr' is the variable into which the data is to be placed, and
               must be a singly dimensioned array, DECIMAL or BINARY,
               FIXED or FLOAT.
          'len' is the number of bits of data to be received.  If 'len'
               is non-positive, no operation is performed.  'len' has
               the attribute BINARY FIXED(31,0).
          'time' is the length of time the subprogram is to wait for the
               completion of the operation.
          'offset' is the bit offset from the first bit of 'bfr' at
               which the first bit of data is to be placed, and must
               have the attributes BINARY FIXED(31,0).  If not
               specified, 'offset' defaults to zero.

     The following completion codes are possible for this operation:

        252,  The specified time limit was exceeded;  the operation was
              initiated but not completed

(5)  CHECK

     This operation causes the status of the specified local  socket  to
     be  returned.  There is no completion code variable associated with
     this operation, since it is always successful  and  the  socket  is
     identified  by  its  socket number.  This operation is valid at any
     time and is always completed immediately.

     The calling sequence is as follows:

          CALL @CHECK(lclsck,stat,mnem,fgnsck,deficit);

     where

          'lclsck' is the socket identifier of the local socket.
          'stat' is a code for the status, and has the attribute BINARY
               FIXED(31,0).
          'mnem' is a mnemonic for the status, and has the attribute
               CHARACTER, of any fixed length greater than or equal to
               eight.  If 'mnem' is longer than eight bytes, it will be
               padded to the right with blanks.
          'fgnsck' is the socket identifier of the foreign socket, or
               zero.

          'deficit' is the send/receive deficit in bits, or zero, and
               has the attributes BINARY FIXED(31,0).

          'lclsck' is the only argument the programmer need define;
              the others are output from the subprogram.

                             'fgnsck' is the socket identifier of the
                             connected socket.  'deficit' is the number
                             of bits queued locally at the socket by the
                             NCP and available to satisfy a future
                             RECEIVE operation, or awaiting output as
                             the result of a previous SEND operation.

             1    LISTEN     A LISTEN has been issued.

             2    CONNECT    A CONNECT has been issued.  'fgnsck' is the

                             socket.

             4    CALL(S)    One or more calls have been received for
                             the local socket.  No LISTEN or CONNECT has

                             'fgnsck' is the socket identifier of the
                             connected socket.  'deficit' is the number
                             of bits yet to be sent or received.

             6    CLOSED     The socket is in the closed state.

                             socket identifier of the connected socket.
                             'deficit' is the number of bits yet to be

             8    DRAINED    The foreign socket is attempting to close
                             the connection.  The NCP is awaiting
                             arrival at the foreign site of data
                             currently in transit.  'fgnsck' is the
                             socket identifier of the connected socket.

             9    CLOSING    The local socket has issued a CLOSE.  The
                             NCP is in the process of returning the
                             local socket to the closed state.  'fgnsck'
                             is the socket identifier of the connected
                             socket.

            10    DRAIN--&gt;   The local socket has issued a CLOSE.  The
                             NCP is completing the last SEND operation
                             before returning the local socket to the
                             closed state.  'fgnsck' is the socket
                             identifier of the connected socket.
                             'deficit' is the number of bits the NCP has
                             yet to transmit.

(6)  IDENTIFY

     This operation is used to identify a local socket by its completion
     code  variable.   The operation is valid at any time, and is always
     completed immediately.  Since it is always successful, there are no
     completion  codes  for  the  operation,  and  the  contents  of the
     completion code variable are not changed.

     The calling sequence is as follows:

          CALL @ID(cmpcd,lclsck);

     where

          'cmpcd' is the completion code variable to be associated with
               the local socket
          'lclsck' is set to the socket identifier of the local socket
               if the completion code variable is associated with a
               socket, or to zero otherwise.

(7)  SIGNAL

     This operation is used to convey a signal to the  foreign  process.
     The  significance  of the signal is completely user-dependent.  The
     effect is that  the  next  time  the  foreign  socket  attempts  to
     initiate  a  RECEIVE  or  SEND  operation,  the  operation  will be
     suppressed, and a completion code supplied indicating that a signal
     had  been  received.  The subprogram will wait until the signal has

          CALL @ID(cmpcd,time);

     where

          'cmpcd' is the completion code variable associated with the
               local socket.
          'time' is the length of time the subprogram is to wait for
               completion of the operation.

     The following completion codes are possible for this operation:

          0,  The operation was successful, and the signal has been sent
          4,  The specified completion code variable is not assigned to
              a socket;  the operation was suppressed
          8,  The connection is not fully open; the operation was
              suppressed

   Certain of the Network subprograms are  intended  for,  although  not
   restricted  to,  use  with the On-Line System Network operators.  The
   following is a general description of these operators:

   In all  Network  operations  involving  the  On-Line  System  Network
   operators, there are certain conventions concerning the format of the
   data sent and received.  The data is grouped in 'messages' consisting
   of  three  fields,  op code, length, and text, in that order.  The op
   code is one byte in length and is a code which indicates how the text
   field  is to be interpreted.  The length field is two bytes long, and
   gives the length, in bits, of the  text  field,  which  contains  the
   actual  data.   (The  op code and length fields together are termed a
   header.)

   The following op codes are presently defined:

     op code        meaning

        0     The op code is a NOP.  No text field exists, and the
              contents of the length field are unpredictable.  (This op
              code is used mainly as a delimiter.)

        1     The text field contains EBCDIC characters, one character
              per byte.  The On-Line System Network operators consider
              the characters as intended for display as soon as the
              text field has been received.

        2     The text contains codes for keypushes, one byte per key.
              The On-Line operators consider the text as intended for
              execution as soon as the text field has been received.

        3     The same as for an op code of 2, except that the On-Line
              operators consider that the execution of the keys will be
              delayed until all data for that receive operation has
              been received.

   The standard format of data sent or received by  the  On-Line  System
   operators is a string of messages, with the last message indicated by
   a header with a NOP op code, called a trailer.  These conventions are
   the  default  situation; any of them may be overridden by appropriate
   programming.

   Following are descriptions of those subprograms intended for use with
   the On-Line System operators.

(8)  WRITE TO ON-LINE CONSOLE

     This subprogram causes data, assumed to be  characters  represented
     by  their EBCDIC codes, to be sent from the specified local socket.
     The characters are sent  in  a  standard  message,  preceded  by  a
     header, and optionally followed by a trailer.  The subprogram waits
     for the data to be received by the foreign socket, or to be  queued
     locally  by  the  NCP.  This operation is valid only when the local
     socket is a send socket, and is fully open.

     The calling sequence is as follows:

          CALL @WTOLC(cmpcd,bfr,len,level,across,down,time);

     where

          'cmpcd' is the completion code variable associated with the
               local socket.
          'bfr' is the character string to be sent, and must have the
               attribute STRING, either CHARACTER or BIT, of any length,
               fixed or varying.
          'len', in absolute value, is the number of characters to be
               sent.  If 'len' is positive or zero, the end of the data
               is indicated by a trailer;  if 'len' is negative, no
               trailer is sent.  'len' has the attributes BINARY
               FIXED(31,0).
          'level' indicates the mode of typing.  The absolute value of
               'level', if non-zero, is the shift level on which to
               type, and must be less than or equal to nine.  If greater
               than nine, one is used.  If 'level' is positive, 'across'



<span class="grey">                                                               [Page 13]</span></pre>

               and down are relative to the current typing location.  If
               'level' is negative, the carriage is positioned to the
               upper left-hand corner before typing begins, thus making
               'across' and 'down' absolute coordinates.  If 'level' is
               zero, the typing is in case one characters, and a
               carriage return precedes the positioning for 'across' and
               'down'.  If the characters to be displayed are case one
               characters, the header sent will have an op code which
               indicates characters to be displayed as soon as they are
               received;  otherwise, the op code will indicate buttons
               to be executed as soon as received.  'level' has the
               attributes BINARY FIXED(31,0).
          'across' is the number of spaces to be moved horizontally
               across the display tube before beginning to type.
               'across' can have any value, positive, negative, or zero,
               and has the attributes BINARY FIXED(31,0).
          'down' is the number of lines to be moved vertically down the
               display tube before beginning to type.  'down' can have
               any value, positive, negative, or zero, and has the
               attributes BINARY FIXED(31,0).
          'time' is the length of time the subprogram is to wait for the
               completion of the operation.

     The completion codes for this operation are the same as for SEND.

(9)  READ FROM ON-LINE CONSOLE

     This subprogram receives data, assumed to be characters represented
     by  their  EBCDIC  codes,  from  the  foreign socket in one or more
     standard  messages.   The  subprogram  will  wait  for  the   data,
     optionally  followed  by  a  trailer,  to  be received by the local
     socket.  This operation is valid only when the local  socket  is  a
     receive socket and is fully open.

     The calling sequence is as follows:

          CALL @RFOLC(cmpcd,bfr,len,time);

     where

          'cmpcd' is the completion code variable associated with the
               local socket.
          'bfr' is the variable into which the data is to be placed, and
               has the attribute CHARACTER, of any fixed length.  If the
               length of 'bfr' is greater than the amount of data
               received, 'bfr' will be padded to the right with blanks.
          'len', in absolute value, is the maximum number of characters
               to be placed in 'bfr'.  If the length fields of the



<span class="grey">                                                               [Page 14]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc120.html">RFC 120</a>                 NETWORK PL1 SUBPROGRAMS</span>


               header(s) received total more data than 'len', the excess
               data will be received, but will not be placed into 'bfr',
               and will not be accessible to the program.  If 'len' is
               positive or zero, data will be received until a trailer
               is encountered.  If 'len' is negative, a single message,
               exclusive of trailer, will be received.  'len' has the
               attributes BINARY FIXED(31,0).
          'time' is the length of time the subprogram is to wait for the
               completion of the operation.

     The completion codes  for  this  operation  are  the  same  as  for
     RECEIVE.

(10)  WRITE TO ON-LINE CONSOLE WITH REPLY

     This  subprogram  combines  the  functions  of  'WRITE  TO  ON-LINE
     CONSOLE'  and  'READ  FROM  ON-LINE CONSOLE'.  The subprogram first
     sends a string of data to the foreign  socket  from  the  specified
     send  socket, waits for it to be received by the foreign socket (or
     queued locally by the NCP), and then waits  for  a  reply  directed
     toward  the  specified receive socket.  The operation is valid only
     when the sockets have the correct gender and both are fully open.

     The calling sequence is as follows:

          CALL @WTOLCR(cmpcd, bfr, len, level, across, down, time,
                       cmpcd2, bfr2, len2);

     where

          'cmpcd' is the completion code variable associated with the
               local send socket.
          'bfr' is as in 'WRITE TO ON-LINE CONSOLE'.
          'len' is as in 'WRITE TO ON-LINE CONSOLE'.
          'level' is as in 'WRITE TO ON-LINE CONSOLE'.
          'across' is as in 'WRITE TO ON-LINE CONSOLE'.
          'down' is as in 'WRITE TO ON-LINE CONSOLE'.
          'time' is the length of time the subprogram is to wait for
               completion, individually, of the transmission and
               reception of data.
          'cmpcd2' is the completion code variable associated with the
               local receive socket.
          'bfr2' is as 'bfr' in 'READ FROM ON-LINE CONSOLE'.
          'len2' is as 'len' in 'READ FROM ON-LINE CONSOLE'.

     The completion codes for the send socket are the same  as  for  the
     SEND operation, and the completion codes for the receive socket are
     the same as for the RECEIVE operation.

(11)  ERASE

      This subprogram causes data constituting an On-Line System command
      to  erase  the  display  tube  to be sent from the specified local
      socket.  The data is sent in a single standard message,  including
      an  op  code  indicating  characters  to  be displayed as they are
      received, and optionally  including  a  trailer.   The  subprogram
      waits  for the data to be received by the foreign socket, or to be
      queued locally by the NCP.  This operation is valid only when  the
      local socket is a send socket, and is fully open.

      The calling sequence is as follows:

           CALL @ERASE(cmpcd,delay1,delay2,time);

      where

           'cmpcd' is the completion code variable associated with the
                local socket.
           'delay1', in absolute value, is the length of time, in tenths
                of a second, the subprogram is to pause (in the WAIT
                state) before sending the erase.  If 'delay1' is
                positive or zero, a trailer will be sent after the
                erase;  if negative, no trailer will be sent.  'delay1'
                has the attributes BINARY FIXED(31,0).
           'delay2', is the length of time, in tenths of a second, the
                subprogram is to pause after sending the erase and
                before returning control to the calling program, and has
                the attributes BINARY FIXED(31,0).
           'time' is the length of time the subprogram is to wait for
                the completion of the operation.

      The completion codes for this operation are the same as for SEND.
