Abstract

   This document provides a general mechanism to use the header
   extension feature of RTP (the Real-time Transport Protocol).  It
   provides the option to use a small number of small extensions in each
   RTP packet, where the universe of possible extensions is large and
   registration is decentralized.  The actual extensions in use in a
   session are signaled in the setup information for that session.  This
   document obsoletes <a href="rfc5285.html">RFC 5285</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The RTP specification [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] provides a capability to extend the
   RTP header.  <a href="rfc3550.html#section-5.3.1">Section 5.3.1 of [RFC3550]</a> defines the header extension
   format and rules for its use.  The existing header extension method
   permits at most one extension per RTP packet, identified by a 16-bit
   identifier and a 16-bit length field specifying the length of the
   header extension in 32-bit words.

   This mechanism has two conspicuous drawbacks.  First, it permits only
   one header extension in a single RTP packet.  Second, the
   specification gives no guidance as to how the 16-bit header extension
   identifiers are allocated to avoid collisions.

   This specification removes the first drawback by defining a backward-
   compatible and extensible means to carry multiple header extension
   elements in a single RTP packet.  It removes the second drawback by
   defining that these extension elements are named by URIs, defining an
   IANA registry for extension elements defined in IETF specifications,
   and providing a Session Description Protocol (SDP) method for mapping
   between the naming URIs and the identifier values carried in the RTP
   packets.

   This header extension applies to RTP/AVP (the Audio/Visual Profile)
   and its extensions.

   This document obsoletes [<a href="rfc5285.html" title='"A General Mechanism for RTP Header Extensions"'>RFC5285</a>] and removes a limitation from
   <a href="rfc5285.html">RFC 5285</a> that did not allow sending both one-byte and two-byte header
   extensions in the same RTP stream.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Requirements%20Notation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Requirements Notation</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="rfc8174.html" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Design%20Goals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Design Goals</span>

   The goal of this design is to provide a simple mechanism whereby
   multiple identified extensions can be used in RTP packets, without
   the need for formal registration of those extensions but nonetheless
   avoiding collisions.

   This mechanism provides an alternative to the practice of burying
   associated metadata into the media format bitstream.  This has often
   been done in media data sent over fixed-bandwidth channels.  Once



<span class="grey">Singer, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-4" id="page-4" name="page-4"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc8285.html">RFC 8285</a>                  RTP Header Extensions             October 2017</span>


   this is done, a decoder for the specific media format needs to
   extract the metadata.  Also, depending on the media format, the
   metadata can be added at the time of encoding the media so that the
   bit-rate used for the metadata is taken into account.  But the
   metadata can be unknown at that time.  Inserting metadata at a later
   time can cause a decode and re-encode to meet bit-rate requirements.

   In some cases, a more appropriate and higher-level mechanism may be
   available, and if so, it can be used.  For cases where a higher-level
   mechanism is not available, it is better to provide a mechanism at
   the RTP level than to have the metadata be tied to a specific form of
   media data.

   The following design is fit into the "header extension" of the RTP
   extension, as described above.

   The presence and format of this header extension and its contents are
   negotiated or defined out of band, such as through signaling (see
   below for SDP signaling).  The 16-bit identifier for the two forms of
   the RTP extension defined here is only an architectural constant
   (e.g., for use by network analyzers); it is the negotiation/
   definition (e.g., in SDP) that is the definitive indication that this
   header extension is present.

   The RTP specification [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] states that RTP "is designed so that
   the header extension may be ignored by other interoperating
   implementations that have not been extended."  The intent of this
   restriction is that RTP header extensions MUST NOT be used to extend
   RTP itself in a manner that is backward incompatible with
   non-extended implementations.  For example, a header extension is not
   allowed to change the meaning or interpretation of the standard RTP
   header fields or of the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP).  Header
   extensions MAY carry metadata in addition to the usual RTP header
   information, provided the RTP layer can function if that metadata is
   missing.  For example, RTP header extensions can be used to carry
   data that's also sent in RTCP, as an optimization to lower latency,
   since they'll fall back to the original non-optimized behavior if the
   header extension is not present.  The use of header extensions to
   convey information that will, if missing, disrupt the behavior of a
   higher-layer application that builds on top of RTP is only acceptable
   if this doesn't affect interoperability at the RTP layer.  For
   example, applications that use the SDP BUNDLE extension with the
   Media Identification (MID) RTP header extension [<a href="#ref-SDP-BUNDLE">SDP-BUNDLE</a>] to
   correlate RTP streams with SDP "m=" lines likely won't work with full

   functionality if the MID is missing, but the operation of the RTP
   layer of those applications will be unaffected.  Support for RTP
   header extensions based on this memo is negotiated using, for
   example, SDP Offer/Answer [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>]; intermediaries aware of the RTP
   header extensions are advised to be cautious when removing or
   generating RTP header extensions.  See <a href="rfc7667.html#section-4.7">Section 4.7 of [RFC7667]</a>.

   The RTP header extension is formed as a sequence of extension
   elements, with possible padding.  Each extension element has a local
   identifier and a length.  The local identifiers MAY be mapped to a
   larger namespace in the negotiation (e.g., session signaling).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.1.%20%20Transmission%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.1" name="section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Transmission Considerations</span>

   As is good network practice, data should only be transmitted when
   needed.  The RTP header extension SHOULD only be present in a packet
   if that packet also contains one or more extension elements, as
   defined here.  An extension element SHOULD only be present in a
   packet when needed; the signaling setup of extension elements
   indicates only that those elements can be present in some packets,
   not that they are in fact present in all (or indeed, any) packets.

   Some general considerations for getting the header extensions
   delivered to the receiver are as follows:

   1.  The probability for packet loss and burst loss determines how
       many repetitions of the header extensions will be required to
       reach a targeted delivery probability, and if burst loss is
       likely, what distribution would be needed to avoid losing all
       repetitions of the header extensions in a single burst.

   2.  If a set of packets are all needed to enable decoding, there is
       commonly no reason for including the header extension in all of
       these packets, as they share fate.  Instead, at most one instance
       of the header extension per independently decodable set of media
       data would be a more efficient use of the bandwidth.

   3.  How early the header extension item information is needed, from
       the first received RTP data or only after some set of packets are
       received, can guide whether the header extension(s) should be
       (1) in all of the first N packets or (2) included only once per
       set of packets -- for example, once per video frame.

   4.  The use of RTP-level robustness mechanisms, such as RTP
       retransmission [<a href="rfc4588.html" title='"RTP Retransmission Payload Format"'>RFC4588</a>] or Forward Error Correction (e.g.,
       [<a href="rfc5109.html" title='"RTP Payload Format for Generic Forward Error Correction"'>RFC5109</a>]) may treat packets differently from a robustness
       perspective, and header extensions should be added to packets
       that get a treatment corresponding to the relative importance of
       receiving the information.

   As a summary, the number of header extension transmissions should be
   tailored to a desired probability of delivery, taking the receiver
   population size into account.  For the very basic case, N repetitions
   of the header extensions should be sufficient but may not be optimal.
   N is selected so that the header extension target delivery
   probability reaches 1-P^N, where P is the probability of packet loss.
   For point-to-point or small receiver populations, it might also be
   possible to use feedback, such as RTCP, to determine when the
   information in the header extensions has reached all receivers and
   stop further repetitions.  Feedback that can be used includes the
   RTCP Extended Report (XR) Loss RLE Report Block [<a href="rfc3611.html" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>], which will
   indicate successful delivery of particular packets.  If the RTP/AVPF
   transport-layer feedback messages for generic NACK [<a href="rfc4585.html" title='"Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)"'>RFC4585</a>] are
   used, they can indicate failure to deliver an RTP packet with the
   header extension, thus indicating the need for further repetitions.
   The normal RTCP report blocks can also provide an indicator of
   successful delivery, if no losses are indicated for a reporting
   interval covering the RTP packets with the header extension.  Note
   that loss of an RTCP packet reporting on an interval where RTP header
   extension packets were sent does not necessarily mean that the RTP
   header extension packets themselves were lost.

   Each extension element in a packet has a local identifier (ID) and a
   length.  The local identifiers present in the stream MUST have been
   negotiated or defined out of band.  There are no static allocations
   of local identifiers.  Each distinct extension MUST have a unique ID.
   The ID value 0 is reserved for padding and MUST NOT be used as a
   local identifier.

   An extension element with an ID value equal to 0 MUST NOT have an
   associated length field greater than 0.  If such an extension element
   is encountered, its length field MUST be ignored, processing of the
   entire extension MUST terminate at that point, and only the extension
   elements present prior to the element with ID 0 and a length field
   greater than 0 SHOULD be considered.

   There are two variants of the extension: one-byte and two-byte
   headers.  Since it is expected that (a) the number of extensions in
   any given RTP session is small and (b) the extensions themselves are

   small, the one-byte header form is preferred and MUST be supported by
   all receivers.  A stream MUST contain only one-byte headers or only
   two-byte headers unless it is known that all recipients support
   mixing, by either SDP Offer/Answer [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>] negotiation (see
   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>) or out-of-band knowledge.  Each RTP packet with an RTP
   header extension following this specification will indicate whether
   it contains one-byte or two-byte header extensions through the use of
   the "defined by profile" field.  Extension element types that do not
   match the header extension format, i.e., one-byte or two-byte,
   MUST NOT be used in that RTP packet.  Transmitters SHOULD NOT use the
   two-byte header form when all extensions are small enough for the
   one-byte header form.  Transmitters that intend to send the two-byte
   form SHOULD negotiate the use of IDs above 14 if they want to let the
   receivers know that they intend to use the two-byte form -- for
   example, if the RTP header extension is longer than 16 bytes.  A
   transmitter may be aware that an intermediary may add RTP header
   extensions; in this case, the transmitter SHOULD use the two-byte
   form.

   A sequence of extension elements, possibly with padding, forms the
   header extension defined in the RTP specification.  There are as many
   extension elements as will fit in the RTP header extension, as
   indicated by the RTP header extension length.  Since this length is
   signaled in full 32-bit words, padding bytes are used to pad to a
   32-bit boundary.  The entire extension is parsed byte by byte to find
   each extension element (no alignment is needed), and parsing stops
   (1) at the end of the entire header extension or (2) in the "one-byte
   headers only" case, on encountering an identifier with the reserved
   value of 15 -- whichever happens earlier.

   In both forms, padding bytes have the value of 0 (zero).  They MAY be
   placed between extension elements, if desired for alignment, or after
   the last extension element, if needed for padding.  A padding byte
   does not supply the ID of an element, nor does it supply the length
   field.  When a padding byte is found, it is ignored, and the parser
   moves on to interpreting the next byte.

   Note carefully that the one-byte header form allows for data lengths
   between 1 and 16 bytes, by adding 1 to the signaled length value
   (thus, 0 in the length field indicates that one byte of data
   follows).  This allows for the important case of 16-byte payloads.
   This addition is not performed for the two-byte headers, where the
   length field signals data lengths between 0 and 255 bytes.

   Use of RTP header extensions will reduce the efficiency of RTP header
   compression, since the header extension will be sent uncompressed
   unless the RTP header compression module is updated to recognize the
   extension header.  If header extensions are present in some packets

   but not in others, this can also reduce compression efficiency by
   requiring an update to the fixed header to be conveyed when header
   extensions start or stop being sent.  The interactions of the RTP
   header extension and header compression are explored further in
   [<a href="rfc2508.html" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links"'>RFC2508</a>] and [<a href="rfc3095.html" title='"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): Framework and four profiles: RTP, UDP, ESP, and uncompressed"'>RFC3095</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20One-Byte%20Header"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  One-Byte Header</span>

   In the one-byte header form of extensions, the 16-bit value required
   by the RTP specification for a header extension, labeled in the RTP
   specification as "defined by profile", MUST have the fixed bit
   pattern 0xBEDE (the pattern was picked for the trivial reason that
   the first version of this specification was written on May 25th --
   the feast day of the Venerable Bede).

   Each extension element MUST start with a byte containing an ID and a
   length:

       0
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  ID   |  len  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The 4-bit ID is the local identifier of this element in the range
   1-14 inclusive.  In the signaling section, this is referred to as the
   valid range.

   The local identifier value 15 is reserved for a future extension and
   MUST NOT be used as an identifier.  If the ID value 15 is
   encountered, its length field MUST be ignored, processing of the
   entire extension MUST terminate at that point, and only the extension
   elements present prior to the element with ID 15 SHOULD be
   considered.

   The 4-bit length is the number, minus one, of data bytes of this
   header extension element following the one-byte header.  Therefore,
   the value zero (0) in this field indicates that one byte of data
   follows, and a value of 15 (the maximum) indicates element data of
   16 bytes.  (This permits carriage of 16-byte values, which is a
   common length of labels and identifiers, while losing the possibility
   of zero-length values, which would often be padded anyway.)

   In the two-byte header form, the 16-bit value defined by the RTP
   specification for a header extension, labeled in the RTP
   specification as "defined by profile", is defined as shown below.

       0                   1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

      |         0x100         |appbits|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The appbits field is 4 bits that are application dependent and MAY be
   defined to be any value or meaning; this topic is outside the scope
   of this specification.  For the purposes of signaling, this field is
   treated as a special extension value assigned to the local identifier
   256.  If no extension has been specified through configuration or
   signaling for this local identifier value (256), the appbits field
   SHOULD be set to all 0s (zeros) by the sender and MUST be ignored by
   the receiver.

   Each extension element starts with a byte containing an ID and a byte
   containing a length:

       0                   1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |       ID      |     length    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The 8-bit ID is the local identifier of this element in the range
   1-255 inclusive.  In the signaling section, the range 1-256 is
   referred to as the valid range, with the values 1-255 referring to

   extension elements and the value 256 referring to the 4-bit appbits
   field (above).  Note that there is one ID space for both the one-byte
   form and the two-byte form.  This means that the lower values (1-14)
   can be used in the 4-bit ID field in the one-byte header format with
   the same meanings.

   The 8-bit length field is the length of extension data in bytes, not
   including the ID and length fields.  The value zero (0) indicates
   that there is no subsequent data.

   An example header extension, with three extension elements and some
   padding, follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   The indication of the presence of this extension, and the mapping of
   local identifiers used in the header extension to a larger namespace,
   MUST be performed out of band -- for example, as part of an SDP
   Offer/Answer [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>].  This section defines such signaling in SDP.

   A usable mapping MUST use IDs in the valid range, and each ID in this
   range MUST be used only once for each media section (or only once if
   the mappings are session level).  Mappings that do not conform to
   these rules MAY be presented, for instance, during SDP Offer/Answer
   [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>] negotiation as described in the next section, but remapping
   to conformant values is necessary before they can be applied.

   Each extension is named by a URI.  That URI MUST be absolute; it
   precisely identifies the format and meaning of the extension.  URIs
   that contain a domain name SHOULD also contain a month-date in the
   form mmyyyy.  The definition of the element and assignment of the URI
   MUST have been authorized by the owner of the domain name on or very
   close to that date.  (This avoids problems when domain names change
   ownership.)  If the resource or document defines several extensions,





<span class="grey">Singer, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 10]</span></pre>

   then the URI MUST identify the actual extension in use, e.g., using a
   fragment or query identifier (characters after a "#" or "?" in
   the URI).

   Rationale: The use of URIs provides for a large, unallocated space
   and gives documentation on the extension.  The URIs do not have to be
   dereferencable, in order to permit confidential or experimental use,
   or to cover the case when extensions continue to be used after the
   organization that defined them ceases to exist.

   An extension URI with the same attributes MUST NOT appear more than
   once applying to the same stream, i.e., at session level or in the
   declarations for a single stream at media level.  (The same extension
   can, of course, be used for several streams and can appear with
   different &lt;extensionattributes&gt; for the same stream.)

   For extensions defined in RFCs, the URI used SHOULD be a URN starting
   with "urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:" followed by a registered,
   descriptive name.

   The registration requirements are detailed in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> ("IANA
   Considerations").

   An example where "avt-example-metadata" is the hypothetical name of a
   header extension might be:

      urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:avt-example-metadata

   An example name not from the IETF might be:

      http://example.com/082005/ext.htm#example-metadata

   The mapping MAY be provided per media stream (in the media-level
   section(s) of SDP, i.e., after an "m=" line) or globally for all
   streams (i.e., before the first "m=" line, at session level).  The
   definitions MUST be either all session level or all media level; it
   is not permitted to mix the two styles.  In addition, as noted above,
   the IDs used MUST be unique in each media section of the SDP or
   unique in the session for session-level SDP declarations.

   Each local identifier potentially used in the stream is mapped to an
   extension identified by a URI using an attribute of the form:

      a=extmap:&lt;value&gt;["/"&lt;direction&gt;] &lt;URI&gt; &lt;extensionattributes&gt;

   where

   o  &lt;value&gt; is the local identifier (ID) of this extension and is an
      integer in the valid range (0 is reserved for padding in both
      forms, and 15 is reserved in the one-byte header form, as noted
      above).

   o  &lt;direction&gt; is one of "sendonly", "recvonly", "sendrecv", or
      "inactive" (without the quotes) with relation to the device being
      configured.

   o  &lt;URI&gt; is a URI, as above.

   The formal BNF syntax is presented in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> of this
   specification.

   Example:

      a=extmap:1 http://example.com/082005/ext.htm#ttime

      a=extmap:2/sendrecv http://example.com/082005/ext.htm#xmeta short

   When SDP signaling is used for the RTP session, it is the presence of
   the "extmap" attribute(s) that is diagnostic that this style of
   header extensions is used, not the magic number ("BEDE" or "100")
   indicated above.

   In order to allow for backward interoperability with systems that
   do not support the mixing of one-byte and two-byte header extensions,
   this document defines the "a=extmap-allow-mixed" Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [<a href="rfc4566.html" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>] attribute to indicate if the participant is
   capable of supporting this new mode.  The attribute takes no value.
   This attribute can be used at the session level or the media level.
   A participant that proposes the use of this mode SHALL itself support
   the reception of mixed one-byte and two-byte header extensions.

   If SDP Offer/Answer [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>] is supported and used, the negotiation
   for mixed one-byte and two-byte extensions MUST be negotiated using
   SDP Offer/Answer per [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>].  In the absence of negotiations using

   SDP Offer/Answer -- for example, when declarative SDP is used --
   mixed headers MUST NOT occur unless the transmitter has some
   (out-of-band) knowledge that all potential recipients support
   this mode.

   The formal definition of this attribute is:

      Name: extmap-allow-mixed

      Value: None

      Usage Level: session, media

      Charset Dependent: No

      Example:

         a=extmap-allow-mixed

   When doing SDP Offer/Answer [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>], an offering client that wishes
   to use both one-byte and two-byte extensions MUST include the
   attribute "a=extmap-allow-mixed" in the SDP offer.  If
   "a=extmap-allow-mixed" is present in the SDP offer, the answerer that
   supports this mode and wishes to use it SHALL include the
   "a=extmap-allow-mixed" attribute in the answer.  In the cases where
   the attribute has been excluded, both clients SHALL NOT use mixed
   one-byte and two-byte extensions in the same RTP stream but MAY use
   the one-byte or two-byte form exclusively (see <a href="#section-4.1.2">Section 4.1.2</a>).

   When used per [<a href="#ref-SDP-BUNDLE">SDP-BUNDLE</a>], this attribute is specified as the
   IDENTICAL category [<a href="#ref-SDP-MUX" title='"A Framework for SDP Attributes when Multiplexing"'>SDP-MUX</a>].

   The simple signaling described above for the "extmap" attribute MAY
   be enhanced in an SDP Offer/Answer [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>] context, to permit:

   o  asymmetric behavior (extensions sent in only one direction),

   o  the offer of mutually exclusive alternatives, or

   o  the offer of more extensions than can be sent in a single session.

   A direction attribute MAY be included in an "extmap"; without it, the
   direction implicitly inherits, of course, from the stream direction
   or is "sendrecv" for session-level attributes or extensions of
   "inactive" streams.  The direction MUST be one of "sendonly",
   "recvonly", "sendrecv", or "inactive" as specified in [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>].

   Extensions, with their directions, MAY be signaled for an "inactive"
   stream.  It is an error to use an extension direction incompatible
   with the stream direction (e.g., a "sendonly" attribute for a
   "recvonly" stream).

   If an offer or answer contains session-level mappings (and hence no
   media-level mappings) and different behavior is desired for each
   stream, then the entire set of extension map declarations MAY be
   moved into the media-level section(s) of the SDP.  (Note that this
   specification does not permit mixing global and local declarations,
   to make identifier management easier.)

   If an extension map is offered as "sendrecv", explicitly or
   implicitly, and asymmetric behavior is desired, the SDP answer MAY be
   changed to modify or add direction qualifiers for that extension.

   If an extension is marked as "sendonly" and the answerer desires to
   receive it, the extension MUST be marked as "recvonly" in the SDP
   answer.  An answerer that has no desire to receive the extension or
   does not understand the extension SHOULD remove it from the SDP
   answer.  An answerer MAY want to respond that he supports the
   extension and does not want to receive it at the moment, but he may
   indicate a desire to receive it in a future offer and will mark the
   extension as "inactive".

   If an extension is marked as "recvonly" and the answerer desires to
   send it, the extension MUST be marked as "sendonly" in the SDP
   answer.  An answerer that has no desire to, or is unable to, send the
   extension SHOULD remove it from the SDP answer.  An answerer MAY want
   to respond that he supports this extension but has no intention of
   sending it now; he may indicate a desire to send it in a future offer
   by marking the extension as "inactive".

   Local identifiers in the valid range inclusive in an offer or answer
   must not be used more than once per media section (including the
   session-level section).  The local identifiers MUST be unique in an
   RTP session, and the same identifier MUST be used for the same
   offered extension in the answer.  A session update MAY change the
   direction qualifiers of extensions being used.  A session update MAY
   add or remove extension(s).  Identifier values in the valid range
   MUST NOT be altered (remapped).

   Note that, under this rule, the same local identifier cannot be used
   for two extensions for the same media, even when one is "sendonly"
   and the other "recvonly", as it would then be impossible to make
   either of them "sendrecv" (since renumbering is not permitted
   either).

   If a party wishes to offer mutually exclusive alternatives, then
   multiple extensions with the same identifier in the extended range
   4096-4351 MAY be offered.  The answerer SHOULD select, at most, one
   of the offered extensions with the same identifier and remap it to a
   free identifier in the valid range for that extension to be usable.

   Similarly, if more extensions are offered than can be fit in the
   valid range, identifiers in the range 4096-4351 MAY be offered; the
   answerer SHOULD choose those that are desired and remap them to a
   free identifier in the valid range.

   An answerer may copy an "extmap" for an identifier in the extended
   range into the answer to indicate to the offerer that it supports
   that extension.  Of course, such an extension cannot be used, since
   there is no way to specify it in an extension header.  If needed, the
   offerer or answerer can update the session to assign a valid
   identifier to that extension URI.

   Rationale: The range 4096-4351 for these negotiation identifiers is
   deliberately restricted to allow expansion of the range of valid
   identifiers in the future.

   Either party MAY include extensions in the stream other than those
   negotiated, or those negotiated as "inactive" (for example, for the
   benefit of intermediate nodes).  Only extensions that appeared with
   an identifier in the valid range in SDP originated by the sender can
   be sent.

   Example (port numbers, RTP profiles, payload IDs, rtpmaps, etc. all
   omitted for brevity):

   The offer:

      a=extmap:1 URI-toffset
      a=extmap:14 URI-obscure
      a=extmap:4096 URI-gps-string
      a=extmap:4096 URI-gps-binary
      a=extmap:4097 URI-frametype
      m=video
      a=sendrecv
      m=audio
      a=sendrecv

   The answerer is interested in receiving GPS in string format only on
   video but cannot send GPS at all.  It is not interested in
   transmission offsets on audio and does not understand the URI-obscure
   extension.  It therefore moves the extensions from session level to
   media level and adjusts the declarations:

      m=video
      a=sendrecv
      a=extmap:1 URI-toffset
      a=extmap:2/recvonly URI-gps-string
      a=extmap:3 URI-frametype
      m=audio
      a=sendrecv
      a=extmap:1/sendonly URI-toffset

   When using [<a href="#ref-SDP-BUNDLE">SDP-BUNDLE</a>] to bundle multiple "m=" lines, the "extmap"
   attribute falls under the SPECIAL category of [<a href="#ref-SDP-MUX" title='"A Framework for SDP Attributes when Multiplexing"'>SDP-MUX</a>].  All the
   "m=" lines in a BUNDLE group are considered to be part of the same
   local identifier (ID) space.  If an RTP header extension, i.e., a
   particular extension URI and configuration using
   &lt;extensionattributes&gt;, is offered in multiple "m=" lines that are
   part of the same BUNDLE group, it MUST use the same ID in all of
   these "m=" lines.  Each "m=" line in a BUNDLE group can include
   different RTP header extensions allowing, for example, audio and
   video sources to use different sets of RTP header extensions.  A
   difference in configuration using any of the &lt;extensionattributes&gt; is
   important.  Unless an RTP header extension explicitly states
   otherwise, any such difference SHALL be communicated to all receivers
   and SHALL cause assignment of different IDs.  An RTP header extension
   that does not follow this rule MUST explicitly define what would
   constitute compatible configurations that can be sent with the
   same ID.  The directionality of the RTP header extensions in each
   "m=" line of the BUNDLE group is handled in the same way as handling
   for non-bundled "m=" lines.  This allows for specifying different
   directionality for each of the repeated extension URIs in a BUNDLE
   group.

   This document defines only a place to transmit information; the
   security implications of each of the extensions must be discussed
   with those extensions.

   Extension usage is negotiated using [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>], so integrity
   protection and end-to-end authentication MUST be implemented.  The
   security considerations of [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>] MUST be followed to prevent, for
   example, extension-usage blocking.

   Header extensions have the same security coverage as the RTP header
   itself.  When the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
   [<a href="rfc3711.html" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>] is used to protect RTP sessions, the RTP payload can be

   both encrypted and integrity protected, while the RTP header is
   either unprotected or integrity protected.  In order to prevent DoS
   attacks (for example, by changing the header extension) integrity
   protection SHOULD be used.  Lower-layer security protection such as
   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [<a href="rfc6347.html" title='"Datagram Transport Layer Security Version 1.2"'>RFC6347</a>] MAY be used.  RTP
   header extensions can carry sensitive information for which
   participants in multimedia sessions want confidentiality.  <a href="rfc6904.html">RFC 6904</a>
   [<a href="rfc6904.html" title='"Encryption of Header Extensions in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC6904</a>] provides a mechanism that extends the mechanisms of SRTP to
   selectively encrypt RTP header extensions in SRTP.

   The RTP application designer needs to consider their security needs,
   that includes cipher strength for SRTP packets in general and what
   that means for the integrity and confidentiality of the RTP header
   extensions.  As defined by <a href="rfc6904.html">RFC 6904</a> [<a href="rfc6904.html" title='"Encryption of Header Extensions in the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC6904</a>], the encryption stream
   cipher for the header extension is dependent on the chosen SRTP
   cipher.

          point-to-multipoint safe -- and the specification correctly
          describes limitations if they exist;

      7.  that the suggested naming URI form is appropriately chosen and

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.%20%20Changes%20from%20RFC%205285"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11" name="section-11">11</a>.  Changes from <a href="rfc5285.html">RFC 5285</a></span>

   The major motivation for updating [<a href="rfc5285.html" title='"A General Mechanism for RTP Header Extensions"'>RFC5285</a>] was to allow having
   one-byte and two-byte RTP header extensions in the same RTP stream
   (but not in the same RTP packet).  The support for this case is
   negotiated using a new SDP attribute, "extmap-allow-mixed", specified
   in this document.

   The other major change is to update the requirement from the RTP
   specifications [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and [<a href="rfc5285.html" title='"A General Mechanism for RTP Header Extensions"'>RFC5285</a>] that the header extension "is
   designed so that the header extension may be ignored."  This is
   described in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   More text was added to <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a> ("Transmission Considerations")
   to clarify when and how many times to send the RTP header extension
   to provide a higher probability of delivery.

   The Security Considerations section was expanded.

   The rest of the changes are editorial.

Acknowledgments

   Both Brian Link and John Lazzaro provided helpful comments on an
   initial draft of this document.  Colin Perkins was helpful in
   reviewing and dealing with the details.  The use of URNs for
   IETF-defined extensions was suggested by Jonathan Lennox, and Pete
   Cordell was instrumental in improving the padding wording.  Dave Oran
   provided feedback and text in the review.  Mike Dolan contributed the
   two-byte header form.  Magnus Westerlund and Tom Taylor were
   instrumental in managing the registration text.
