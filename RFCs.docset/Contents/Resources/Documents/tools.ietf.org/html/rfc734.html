INTRODUCTION

This document describes  the SUPDUP protocol,  a highly efficient  display
telnet protocol.  It originally started as a private protocol between  the
ITS systems at MIT to allow a user at any one of these systems to use  one
of the others as a display.  At the current writing, SUPDUP user  programs
also exist  for  Data  Disc  and  Datamedia  displays  at  SU-AI  and  for
Datamedias at SRI-KL.  The author is not aware of any SUPDUP servers other
than at the four MIT ITS sites.

The advantage  of  the  SUPDUP  protocol  over  an  individual  terminal's
protocol is that SUPDUP defines a "virtual" or "software" display terminal
that implements relevant  cursor motion operations.   The protocol is  not
built on  any  particular  display  terminal but  rather  on  the  set  of
functions common to all display terminals; hence it is completely  device-
independent.  In addition, the protocol also provides for terminals  which
cannot handle certain operations, such as line or character insert/delete.
In fact,  it is  more than  this.   It provides  for terminals  which  are
missing any set of features, all the way down to model 33 Teletypes.

The advantage over the TELNET protocol  is that SUPDUP takes advantage  of
the full  capabilities of  display  terminals, although  it also  has  the
ability to run printing terminals.

It is to be  noted that SUPDUP operates  independently from TELNET; it  is
not an option to  the TELNET protocol.   In addition, certain  assumptions
are made about the  server and the user  programs and their  capabilities.
Specifically, it is  assumed that the  operating system on  a server  host
provides all the display-oriented features of ITS.  However, a server  may
elect not to do certain display operations available in SUPDUP; the SUPDUP
protocol is far-reaching enough so  that the protocol allows terminals  to
be handled  as well  as that  host can  handle terminals  in general.   Of
course, if a host does not  support display terminals in any special  way,
there is no point in bothering  to implement a SUPDUP server since  TELNET
will work just as well.

A more complete description  of the display facilities  of SUPDUP and  ITS
can be found by FTP'ing the  online file .INFO.;ITS TTY from ARPAnet  host
MIT-AI (host 206 octal, 134. decimal).  For more information, the  mailing
address for SUPDUP is "(BUG SUPDUP) at MIT-AI".  If your mail system won't
allow you to use parentheses, use Bug-SUPDUP@MIT-AI.

SUPDUP Display Protocol                                             Page 2

BACKGROUND

The SUPDUP protocol originated as the internal protocol used between parts
of ITS, and between ITS and "intelligent" terminals.  Over the network,  a
user host acts like an intelligent terminal programmed for ITS.

The way terminal  output works  in ITS is  as follows:   The user  program
tells the system to  do various operations,  such as printing  characters,
clearing the screen, moving the cursor, etc.  These operations are  formed
into 8-bit characters  (using the  %TD codes described  below) and  stored
into a  buffer.   At interrupt  level,  as the  terminal  demands  output,
characters are  removed  from  the buffer  and  translated  into  terminal
dependent codes.  At this time  padding and cursor motion optimization are
also done.

In some cases, the interrupt side does not run on the same machine as  the
user program.  SUPDUP terminals have their "interrupt side" running in the
user host.  When  SUPDUP is  run between two  ITS's, the  SUPDUP user  and
server programs and the network simply move characters from the buffer  in
the server machine to the buffer in the user machine.  The interrupt  side
then runs on the user machine just as if the characters had been generated
locally.

Due to the highly interactive characteristics of both the SUPDUP  protocol
and the ITS system, all transactions are strictly character at a time  and
all echoing  is  remote.  In  addition,  all padding  and  cursor  control
optimization must be done by the user.

Because this is also the internals of ITS, the right to change it any time
if necessary to provide new features  is reserved by MIT.  In  particular,
the initial  negotiation  is probably  going  to be  changed  to  transmit
additional variables, and additional %TD codes  may be added at any  time.
User programs should ignore those they don't know about.

The following conventions are  used in this  document: function keys  (ie,
keys which represent a "function"  rather than a "graphic character")  are
in upper case in square brackets.  Prefix keys (ie, keys which generate no
character but  rather are  held  down while  typing another  character  to
modify that  character)  are  in  upper case  in  angle  brackets.   Hence
"&lt;CONTROL&gt;&lt;META&gt;[LINE FEED]" refers to  the character generated when  both
the CONTROL and META keys  are held down while a LINE FEED is typed.  Case
should  be  noted;  &lt;CONTROL&gt;A  refers  to  a  different  character   from
&lt;CONTROL&gt;a.  Finally, all numbers which  do not explicitly specify a  base
(ie, octal  or decimal)  should be  read  as octal  unless the  number  is
immediately followed by a period, in which case it is decimal.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </pre>

INITIALIZATION

The SUPDUP server listens on socket 137 octal.  ICP proceeds in the normal
way for establishing 8-bit connections.   After the ICP is completed,  the
user side  sends several  parameters to  the server  side in  the form  of
36.-bit words.  Each  word is  sent through  the 8-bit  connection as  six
6-bit bytes, most-significant first.  Each byte is in the low-order 6 bits
of a character.  The first word is the negative of the number of variables
to follow in the high order 18. bits (the low-order 18. bits are ignored),
followed by the  values of  the TCTYP,  TTYOPT, TCMXV,  TCMXH, and  TTYROL
terminal descriptor variables (these  are the names they  are known by  at
ITS sites).  These  variables are  36.-bit binary numbers  and define  the
terminal characteristics for the virtual terminal at the REMOTE host.

The count is for future compatability.  If more variables need to be  sent
in the future, the server should assume "reasonable" default values if the
user does not specify them.  PDP-10 fans will recognize the format of  the
count (ie, -count,,0) as being an  AOBJN pointer.  At the present  writing
there are five variables hence this word should be -5,,0.

The TCTYP variable defines the terminal type.  It MUST be 7 (%TNSFW).  Any
other value is a violation of protocol.

The TTYOPT  variable specifies  what capabilities  or options  the  user's
terminal has.  A bit being true implies that the terminal has this option.
This variable also includes user options which the user may wish to  alter
at his or her own descretion; these options are included since they may be
specified along with the terminal capabilities in the initial negotiation.
See below for the relevant TTYOPT bits.

The TCMXV variable specifies the screen height in number of lines.

The TCMXH variable specifies the line width in number of characters.  This
value is one less  than the screen width  (ITS indicates line overflow  by
outputting an exclamation  point at  the end  of the  display line  before
moving to the  next line).  Note:  the terminal must  not do an  automatic
CRLF when a  character is  printed in the  rightmost column.   If this  is
unavoidable, the user SUPDUP must decrement the width it sends by one.

Note: Setting either the TCMXV or  TCMXH dimension greater than 128.  will
work, but will have some problems as coordinates are sometimes represented
in only  7 bits.   The main  problems occur  in the  SUPDUP protocol  when
sending the cursor position after an output reset and in ITS user programs
using the display position codes ^PH and ^PV.

The TTYROL variable specifies the "glitch count" when scrolling.  This  is
the number of lines to scroll up when scrolling is required.  If zero, the
terminal is not  capable of  scrolling.  1 is  the usual  value, but  some
terminals glitch up by more than one line when they scroll.

Following the transmission of the terminal options by the user, the server
should respond with an  ASCII greeting message,  terminated with a  %TDNOP
code (%TD codes are described  below).  All transmissions from the  server

The user  and  the  server  now both  communicate  using  the  intelligent
terminal protocol (described below) from the  user and %TD codes from  the
server.  The user has two commands in addition to these; they are  escaped
by sending 300  (octal).  If following  the escape is  a 301 (octal),  the
server should attempt to  log off the remote  job (generally this is  sent
immediately before the user disconnects,  so this logout procedure  should
be done regardless of the continuing integrity of the connection).  If the
character following  the escape  is a  302 (octal),  all ASCII  characters
following up to a null (000  octal) are interpreted as "console  location"
which the server  can handle as  it pleases.  No  carriage return or  line
feed should be in the console location text.  Normally this is saved  away
to be displayed by the "who" command when other users ask where this  user
is located.

TTYOPT FUNCTION BITS

The relevant TTYOPT bits for SUPDUP usage follow.  The values are given in
octal, with the left and right 18-bit  halves separated by ",," as in  the
usual PDP-10 convention.

Bit name        Value           Meaning

%TOALT          200000,,0       characters  175  and 176  are converted to
                                altmode (033) on input.

%TOERS           40000,,0       this  terminal  is capable  of selectively
                                erasing its  screen.  That is, it supports
                                the %TDEOL,  the %TDDLF,  and (optionally)
                                the  %TDEOF  operations.   For   terminals
                                which   can   only   do   single-character
                                erasing, see %TOOVR.

%TOMVB           10000,,0       this  terminal  is capable of  backspacing
                                (ie, moving the cursor backwards).

%TOSAI            4000,,0       this   terminal   has   the   Stanford/ITS
                                extended ASCII graphics character set.

%TOOVR            1000,,0       this terminal is  capable of overprinting;
                                if  two  characters  are  displayed in the
                                same  position, they will both be visible,
                                rather than one replacing the other.

                                Lack of this capability but the capability
                                to backspace (see %TOMVB) implies that the
                                terminal can  do single  character erasing
                                by overstriking with a space.  This allows
                                terminals without the %TOERS capability to
                                have display-style "rubout processing", as
                                this capability depends upon either %TOERS
                                or [%TOMVB and not %TOOVR].

%TOMVU             400,,0       this terminal  is capable  of  moving  the
                                cursor upwards.

%TOLWR              20,,0       this  terminal's  keyboard is  capable  of
                                generating lowercase characters;  this bit
                                is mostly provided for programs which want
                                to know this information.

%TOFCI              10,,0       this  terminal's  keyboard is  capable  of
                                generating  CONTROL and META characters as
                                described below.

%TOLID               2,,0       this  terminal  is  capable  of doing line
                                insert/delete operations,  ie, it supports
                                %TDILP and %TDDLP.

INPUT -- THE INTELLIGENT TERMINAL PROTOCOL

Note: only  the parts  of the  intelligent terminal  protocol relevant  to
SUPDUP are discussed here.  For more information, read ITS TTY.


CHARACTER SETS

There are two  character sets  available for  use with  SUPDUP; the  7-bit
character set of standard ASCII, and the 12-bit character set of  extended
ASCII.  Extended ASCII has 5 high order  or "bucky" bits on input and  has
graphics for octal 000-037 and 177 (see the section entitled "Stanford/ITS
character set" for more details).  The two character sets are identical on
output since the protocol  specifies that the host  should never send  the
standard ASCII  formatting  characters  (ie,  TAB,  LF,  VT,  FF,  CR)  as
formatting characters; the characters whose  octal values are the same  as
these formatting characters are never output unless the user job has these
characters enabled (setting %TOSAI and %TOSA1 generally does this).

Input differs dramatically  between the 7-bit  and 12-bit character  sets.
In the 7-bit character set, all characters input whose value is 037  octal
or less  are assumed  to be  (ASCII) control  characters.  In  the  12-bit
character set,  there are  5 "bucky"  bits which  may be  attached to  the
character.  The two most  important of these are  CONTROL and META,  which
form a 9-bit character set.  TOP  is used to distinguish between  printing
graphics in the extended character set and ASCII controls.  The other  two
are reserved and should be ignored.  Since both 7-bit and 12-bit terminals
are commonly in use, 0001, 0301, and 0341 are considered to be  &lt;CONTROL&gt;A
on input by most programs, while 4001 is considered to be downwards arrow.


MAPPING BETWEEN CHARACTER SETS

Many programs and hosts do not process 12-bit input.  In this case, 12-bit
input is folded down to 7-bit as follows: TOP and META are discarded.   If
CONTROL is on, then if the 7-bit  part of the character specifies a  lower
case alphabetic it is converted to upper  case; then if the 7-bit part  is
between 077 and 137 the  100 bit is complemented or  if the 7-bit part  is
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/040%20the%20040%20bit%20is%20subtracted"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-040" name="section-040">040</a> the 040 bit is subtracted  </span>(that's right, &lt;CONTROL&gt;?  is converted  to
[RUBOUT] and &lt;CONTROL&gt;[SPACE] is  converted to [NULL]).   In any case  the
CONTROL bit is discarded,  and the remainder is  treated as a 7-bit  ASCII
character.  It should be noted that  in this case downwards arrow is  read
by the program as standard ASCII &lt;CONTROL&gt;A.

Servers which expect 12-bit input and are told to use the 7-bit  character
set should  do  appropriate unfolding  from  the 7-bit  character  set  to
12-bit.  It is up  to the individual server  to decide upon the  unfolding
scheme.  On ITS, user programs that use the 12-bit character set generally
have an alternative method for 7-bit; this often takes the form of  prefix
characters indicating that the next character should be "controllified" or
"metized", etc.
                                                                                                                                         </pre>

INPUT -- THE INTELLIGENT TERMINAL PROTOCOL (continued)


BUCKY BITS

Under normal circumstances, characters input from the keyboard are sent to
the foreign host as is.  There  are two exceptions; the first occurs  when
an octal 034  character is to  be sent; it  must be quoted  by being  sent
twice, because 034 is used as  an escape character for protocol  commands.
The second  exception occurs  when  %TOFCI is  set  and a  character  with
non-zero bucky bits is to be sent.  In this case, the character, which  is
in the 12-bit form:

Name    Value   Description

%TXTOP  4000    This character has the [TOP] key depressed.

%TXSFL  2000    Reserved, must be zero.

%TXSFT  1000    Reserved, must be zero.

%TXMTA   400    This character has the [META] key depressed.

%TXCTL   200    This character has the [CONTROL] key depressed.

%TXASC   177    The ASCII portion of the character

is sent as three bytes.  The first  byte is always 034 octal (that is  why
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/034%20must%20be"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-034" name="section-034">034</a> must be  </span>quoted).  The next  byte contains the  "bucky bits", ie,  the
%TXTOP through %TXCTL bits,  shifted over 7 bits  (ie, %TXTOP becomes  20)
with the 100  bit on.   The third  byte contains  the %TXASC  part of  the
character.  Hence the character &lt;CONTROL&gt;&lt;META&gt;[LINE FEED] is sent as  034
<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/103%20012."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-103" name="section-103">103</a> 012.</span>


OUTPUT RESETS

The  intelligent  terminal  protocol  also  is  involved  when  a  network
interrupt (INR/INS) is  received by  the user program.   The user  program
should increment a count of received network interrupts when this happens.
It should not do any output, and if possible abort any output in progress,
if this count is greater than zero  (NOTE: the program MUST allow for  the
count to go less than zero).

Since the server  no longer  knows where the  cursor is,  it suspends  all
output until the user informs it of the cursor position.  This also  gives
the server an idea of how much was thrown out in case it has to have  some
of the aborted output  displayed at a later  time.  The user program  does
this when it  receives a  %TDORS from the  server.  When  this happens  it
should  decrement  the  "number  of  received  network  interrupts"  count
described in the previous paragraph and then send 034 followed by 020, the
vertical position,  and  the  horizontal  position  of  where  the  cursor
currently is located on the user's screen.

OUTPUT -- DISPLAY PROTOCOL (%TD CODES)

Display output  is  somewhat  simpler.   Codes less  than  200  octal  are
printing characters and  are displayed  on the terminal  (see the  section
describing the "Stanford/ITS character set").  Codes greater than or equal
to 200 (octal) are known as "%TD codes", so called since their names begin
with %TD.  The %TD codes that are relevant to SUPDUP operation are  listed
here.  Any other code  received should be ignored,  although a bug  report
might be sent  to the server's  maintainers.  Note that  the normal  ASCII
formatting characters (011 - 015) do NOT have their formatting sense under
SUPDUP and should not occur at all unless the Stanford/ITS extended  ASCII
character set is in use (ie, %TOSAI is set in the TTYOPT word).

For cursor  positioning operations,  the  top left  corner is  (0,0),  ie,
vertical position 0, horizontal position 0.

                                vertical  and horizontal positions and may
                                be  ignored.    The  next  two are the new
                                vertical  and  horizontal  positions.  The
                                cursor  should be moved  to this position.

                                On printing consoles (non %TOMVU), the old
                                vertical position may differ from the true
                                vertical position;  this  can  occur  when
                                scrolling.  In this case, the user program
                                should set  its  idea of the old  vertical
                                position to what the %TDMOV says and  then
                                proceed.  Hence a %TDMOV with an old  vpos
                                of 20. and a new vpos of 22. should always
                                move the "cursor" down two lines.  This is
                                used to prevent the vertical position from
                                becoming infinite.

%TDMV1          201             An  internal  cursor  motion  code   which
                                should not be seen;  but if it is,  it has
                                two  argument bytes after it and should be
                                treated the same as %TDMV0.

%TDEOF          202             Erase  to  end  of  screen.   This  is  an
                                optional function  since many terminals do
                                not support this.   If  the terminal  does
                                not  support this  function,  it should be
                                treated the same as %TDEOL.

                                %TDEOF does an erase to end of line,  then
                                erases  all lines lower on the screen than
                                the cursor.  The cursor does not move.

%TDEOL          203             Erase  to  end  of  line.  This erases the
                                character position the  cursor  is at  and
                                all  positions  to the right on  the  same
                                line.  The cursor does not move.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </pre>

%TD code        Value           Meaning

%TDDLF          204             Clear the character position the cursor is
                                on.  The cursor does not move.

%TDCRL          207             If the cursor is not on the bottom line of
                                the screen, move  cursor to  the beginning
                                of the next line and clear that line.   If
                                the  cursor is at the bottom line,  scroll
                                up.

%TDNOP          210             No-op; should be ignored.

%TDORS          214             Output reset.   This code serves as a data
                                mark for  aborting  output much as  IAC DM
                                does in the ordinary TELNET protocol.

%TDQOT          215             Quotes the following  character.   This is
                                used  when sending 8-bit codes  which  are
                                not  %TD codes,  for instance when loading
                                programs  into  an  intelligent  terminal.
                                The  following  character should be passed
                                through intact to the terminal.

%TDFS           216             Non-destructive forward space.  The cursor
                                moves right one position;  this  code will
                                not be sent at the end of a line.

%TDMV0          217             General cursor position code.  Followed by
                                two bytes; the new vertical and horizontal
                                positions.

%TDCLR          220             Erase the screen.   Home the cursor to the
                                top left hand corner of the screen.

%TDBEL          221             Generate an audio tone, bell, whatever.

%TDILP          223             Insert blank lines at the cursor; followed
                                by a byte containing a count of the number
                                of blank lines to insert.   The  cursor is
                                unmoved.   The line the cursor is  on  and
                                all lines below it move down;  lines moved
                                off the bottom of the screen are lost.

%TDDLP          224             Delete lines at the cursor;  followed by a
                                count.  The cursor is unmoved.   The first
                                line  deleted is the  one the cursor is on.
                                Lines below those deleted move up.  Newly-
                                created lines  at the bottom of the screen
                                are blank.

STANFORD/ITS CHARACTER SET

This section describes the extended  ASCII character set.   It  originated
with the character set developed at SAIL but was modified for 1968 ASCII.

This character set only  applies to terminals with  the %TOSAI and  %TOFCI
bits set in its TTYOPT word.  For non-%TOSAI terminals, the standard ASCII
printing  characters  are  the  only  available  output  characters.   For
non-%TOFCI terminals, the standard ASCII characters are the only available
input characters.


PRINTING CHARACTERS

The first table describes the printing characters.  For output, the  7-bit
code is sent (terminal operations are performed by %TD codes).  For input,
the characters with values 000-037 and 177 must have the %TXTOP bit on  to
indicate the graphic is intended rather than a function or ASCII control.

FUNCTION KEYS AND SPECIAL CHARACTERS

In addition, the following special characters exist for input only.  These
characters are  function keys  rather than  printing characters;  however,
some of these  characters have some  format effect or  graphic which  they
echo as; the host, not the SUPDUP program, handles any such mappings.

Value   Character       Usual echo              Usual Function

BUCKY BITS

For all input characters, the following  "bucky bits" may be added to  the
character.  Their interpretation depends entirely upon the host.  &lt;TOP&gt; is
not listed here, as it  has been considered part  of the character in  the
previous  tables.

&lt;CONTROL&gt; is different from ASCII CTRL, however, many programs may request
the operating system to map such  characters to the ASCII forms (with  the
&lt;TOP&gt; bit off).  In this case &lt;META&gt; is ignored.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Richard M. Stallman (RMS@MIT-AI)  and David A.  Moon (Moon@MIT-MC) of  the
MIT-AI and MIT-MC  systems staff  wrote the source  documentation and  the
wonderful ITS terminal support that made this protocol possible.  It  must
be emphasized  that  this is  a  functional  protocol which  has  been  in
