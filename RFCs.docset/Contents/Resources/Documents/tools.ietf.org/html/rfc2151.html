<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This memo is an introductory guide to some of the most commonly-
   available TCP/IP and Internet tools and utilities that allow users to
   access the wide variety of information on the network, from
   determining if a particular host is up to viewing a multimedia thesis
   on foreign policy. It also describes discussion lists accessible from
   the Internet, ways to obtain Internet and TCP/IP documents, and some
   resources that help users weave their way through the Internet. This
   memo may be used as a tutorial for individual self-learning, a step-
   by-step laboratory manual for a course, or as the basis for a site's
   users manual. It is intended as a basic guide only and will refer to
   other sources for more detailed information.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Nomenclature"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Nomenclature</span>

   The following sections provide descriptions and detailed examples of
   several TCP/IP utilities and applications, including the reproduction
   of actual sessions using these utilities (with some extraneous
   information removed). Each section describes a single TCP/IP-based
   tool, it's application, and, in some cases, how it works. The text
   description is usually followed by an actual sample session.

   The sample dialogues shown below were obtained from a variety of
   software and hardware systems, including AIX running on an IBM
   RS/6000, Linux on an Intel 486, Multinet TCP/IP over VMS on a VAX,
   and FTP Software's OnNet (formerly PC/TCP) running on a DOS/Windows
   PC. While the examples below can be used as a guide to using and
   learning about the capabilities of TCP/IP tools, the reader should
   understand that not all of these utilities may be found at all TCP/IP
   hosts nor in all commercial software packages. Furthermore, the user

   interface for different packages will be different and the actual
   command line may appear differently than shown here; this will be
   particularly true for graphical user interfaces running over Windows,
   X-Windows, OS/2, or Macintosh systems. Windows-based sessions are not
   shown in this RFC because of the desire to have a text version of
   this document; in addition, most GUI-based TCP/IP packages obscure
   some of the detail that is essential for understanding what is really
   happening when you click on a button or drag a file. The Internet has
   many exciting things to offer but standardized interfaces to the
   protocols is not yet one of them!  This guide will not provide any
   detail or motivation about the Internet Protocol Suite; more
   information about the TCP/IP protocols and related issues may be
   found in <a href="rfc1180.html">RFC 1180</a> [<a href="#ref-29" title='"TCP/IP Tutorial,"'>29</a>], Comer [<a href="#ref-6" title="and Architecture">6</a>], Feit [<a href="#ref-7" title="Protocols">7</a>], Kessler [<a href="#ref-14" title='"An Overview of TCP/IP Protocols and the Internet."'>14</a>], and
   Stevens [<a href="#ref-30" title="W.R. TCP/IP Illustrated">30</a>].

   In the descriptions below, commands are shown in a Courier font
   (Postscript and HTML versions); items appearing in square brackets
   ([]) are optional, the vertical-bar (|) means "or," parameters
   appearing with no brackets or within curly brackets ({}) are
   mandatory, and parameter names that need to be replaced with a
   specific value will be shown in italics (Postscript and HTML
   versions) or within angle brackets (&lt;&gt;, text version). In the sample
   dialogues, user input is in bold (Postscript and HTML versions) or
   denoted with asterisks (**) in the margin (text version).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20Finding%20Information%20About%20Internet%20Hosts%20and%20Domains"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>. Finding Information About Internet Hosts and Domains</span>

   There are several tools that let you learn information about Internet
   hosts and domains. These tools provide the ability for an application
   or a user to perform host name/address reconciliation (NSLOOKUP),
   determine whether another host is up and available (PING), learn
   about another host's users (Finger), and learn the route that packets
   will take to another host (Traceroute).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20NSLOOKUP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>. NSLOOKUP</span>

   NSLOOKUP is the name server lookup program that comes with many
   TCP/IP software packages. A user can use NSLOOKUP to examine entries
   in the Domain Name System (DNS) database that pertain to a particular
   host or domain; one common use is to determine a host system's IP
   address from its name or the host's name from its IP address. The
   general form of the command to make a single query is:

      nslookup [IP_address|host_name]

   If the program is started without any parameters, the user will be
   prompted for input; the user can enter either an IP address or host
   name at that time, and the program will respond with the name and

   address of the default name sever, the name server actually used to
   resolve each request, and the IP address and host name that was
   queried. Exit is used to quit the NSLOOKUP application.

   Three simple queries are shown in the example below:

      1 Requests the address of the host named www.hill.com, the World
      Wide Web server at Hill Associates. As it turns out, this is not
      the true name of the host, but an alias. The full name of the host
      and the IP address are listed by NSLOOKUP.

      2 Requests the address of host syrup.hill.com, which is the same
      host as in the first query. Note that NSLOOKUP provides a "non-
      authoritative" answer. Since NSLOOKUP just queried this same
      address, the information is still in its cache memory. Rather than
      send additional messages to the name server, the answer is one
      that it remembers from before; the server didn't look up the
      information again, however, so it is not guaranteed to still be
      accurate (because the information might have changed within the
      last few milliseconds!).

      3 Requests the name of the host with the given IP address. The
      result points to the Internet gateway to Australia, munnari.oz.au.

   One additional query is shown in the dialogue below. NSLOOKUP
   examines information that is stored by the DNS. The default NSLOOKUP
   queries examine basic address records (called "A records") to
   reconcile the host name and IP address, although other information is
   also available. In the final query below, for example, the user wants
   to know where electronic mail addressed to the hill.com domain
   actually gets delivered, since hill.com is not the true name of an
   actual host. This is accomplished by changing the query type to look
   for mail exchange (MX) records by issuing a set type command (which
   must be in lower case). The query shows that mail addressed to
   hill.com is actually sent to a mail server called mail.hill.com. If
   that system is not available, mail delivery will be attempted to
   first mailme.hill.com and then to netcomsv.netcom.com; the order of
   these attempts is controlled by the "preference" value. This query
   also returns the name of the domain's name servers and all associated
   IP addresses.

   The DNS is beyond the scope of this introduction, although more
   information about the concepts and structure of the DNS can be found
   in STD 13/RFC 1034 [<a href="#ref-19" title='"Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities,"'>19</a>], <a href="rfc1591.html">RFC 1591</a> [<a href="#ref-21" title='"Domain Name System Structure and Delegation,"'>21</a>], and Kessler [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Running Your Own DNS."'>16</a>]. The help
   command can be issued at the program prompt for information about
   NSLOOKUP's more advanced commands.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20Ping"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>. Ping</span>

   Ping, reportedly an acronym for the Packet Internetwork Groper, is
   one of the most widely available tools bundled with TCP/IP software
   packages.  Ping uses a series of Internet Control Message Protocol
   (ICMP) [<a href="#ref-22" title='"Internet Control Message Protocol,"'>22</a>] Echo messages to determine if a remote host is active or
   inactive, and to determine the round-trip delay in communicating with
   it.

   A common form of the Ping command, showing some of the more commonly
   available options that are of use to general users, is:

      ping [-q] [-v] [-R] [-c Count] [-i Wait] [-s PacketSize] Host

   where:

         -q          Quiet output; nothing is displayed except summary
         lines at startup and completion

         -v          Verbose output, which lists ICMP packets that are
         received in addition to Echo Responses

         -R          Record route option; includes the RECORD_ROUTE
         option in the Echo Request packet and displays the route buffer
         on returned packets

         -c Count    Specifies the number of Echo Requests to be sent
         before concluding test (default is to run until interrupted
         with a control-C)

         -i Wait     Indicates the number of seconds to wait between
         sending each packet (default = 1)

         -s PacketSize    Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent;
         the total ICMP packet size will be PacketSize+8 bytes due to
         the ICMP header (default = 56, or a 64 byte packet)

         Host   IP address or host name of target system

   In the first example below, the user pings the host
   thumper.bellcore.com, requesting that 6 (-c) messages be sent, each
   containing 64 bytes (-s) of user data. The display shows the round-
   trip delay of each Echo message returned to the sending host; at the
   end of the test, summary statistics are displayed.

   In the second example, the user pings the host smcvax.smcvt.edu,
   requesting that 10 messages be sent in quite mode (-q). In this case,
   a summary is printed at the conclusion of the test and individual
   responses are not listed.

   TECHNICAL NOTE: Older versions of the Ping command, which are still
   available on some systems, had the following general format:

      ping [-s] {IP_address|host_name} [PacketSize] [Count]

   In this form, the optional "-s" string tells the system to
   continually send an ICMP Echo message every second; the optional
   PacketSize parameter specifies the number of bytes in the Echo
   message (the message will contain PacketSize-8 bytes of data; the
   default is 56 bytes of data and a 64 byte message); and the optional
   Count parameter indicates the number of Echo messages to send before
   concluding the test (the default is to run the test continuously
   until interrupted).

   The Finger program may be used to find out who is logged in on
   another system or to find out detailed information about a specific
   user. This command has also introduced a brand new verb; fingering
   someone on the Internet is not necessarily a rude thing to do!  The
   Finger User Information Protocol is described in <a href="rfc1288.html">RFC 1288</a> [<a href="#ref-32" title='"The Finger User Information Protocol,"'>32</a>]. The
   most general format of the Finger command is:

      finger [username]@host_name

   The first example below shows the result of fingering an individual
   user at a remote system. The first line of the response shows the
   username, the user's real name, their process identifier,
   application, and terminal port number. Additional information may be
   supplied at the option of the user in "plan" and/or "project" files
   that they supply; these files are often named PLAN.TXT or
   PROJECT.TXT, respectively, and reside in a user's root directory (or
   somewhere in an appropriate search path).

   The second example shows the result of fingering a remote system.
   This lists all of the processes currently running at the fingered
   system or other information, depending upon how the remote system's
   administrator set up the system to respond to the Finger command.

   Traceroute is another common TCP/IP tool, this one allowing users to
   learn about the route that packets take from their local host to a
   remote host. Although used often by network and system managers as a
   simple, yet powerful, debugging tool, traceroute can be used by end
   users to learn something about the ever-changing structure of the
   Internet.

   The classic Traceroute command has the following general format
   (where "#" represents a positive integer value associated with the
   qualifier):

     traceroute [-m #] [-q #] [-w #] [-p #] {IP_address|host_name}

         where
            -m   is the maximum allowable TTL value, measured as
            the number of hops allowed before the program terminates
            (default = 30)
            -q   is the number of UDP packets that will be sent with
            each time-to-live setting (default = 3)
            -w   is the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for
            an answer from a particular router before giving up
            (default= 5)
            -p   is the invalid port address at the remote host
            (default = 33434)

   The Traceroute example below shows the route between a host at St.
   Michael's College (domain smcvt.edu) and a host at Hill Associates
   (www.hill.com), both located in Colchester, VT but served by
   different Internet service providers (ISP).

      1 St. Michael's College is connected to the Internet via BBN
      Planet; since the mid-1980s, BBN operated the NSF's regional ISP,
      called the New England Academic and Research Network (NEARNET),
      which was renamed in 1994. The first hop, then, goes to St. Mike's
      BBN Planet gateway router (smc.bbnplanet.net). The next hop goes
      to another BBN Planet router (denoted here only by IP address
      since a name was not assigned to the device), until the packet
      reaches the BBN Planet T3 backbone.

      2 The packet takes two hops through routers at BBN Planet's
      Cambridge (MA) facility and is then forwarded to BBN Planet in New
      York City, where the packet takes four more hops. The packet is
      then forwarded to BBN Planet in College Park (MD).

      3 The packet is sent to BBN Planet's router at MAE-East, MFS
      Datanet's Network Access Point (NAP) in Washington, D.C. MAE
      stands for Metropolitan Area Exchange, and is a Fiber Distributed
      Data Interface (FDDI) ring interconnecting routers from
      subscribing ISPs. The packet is then forwarded to NETCOM, Hill
      Associates' ISP.

      4 The packet now travels through NETCOM's T3 backbone, following
      links from Washington, D.C. to Chicago to Santa Clara (CA), to San
      Jose (CA).

      5 The packet is now sent to Hill Associates router (again, a
      system designated only by an IP address since the NETCOM side of
      the router was not named) and then passed to the target system.
      Note that the host's real name is not www.hill.com, but
      syrup.hill.com.

   TECHNICAL NOTE: The original version of Traceroute works by sending a
   sequence of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagrams to an invalid port
   address at the remote host. Using the default settings, three
   datagrams are sent, each with a Time-To-Live (TTL) field value set to
   one. The TTL value of 1 causes the datagram to "timeout" as soon as
   it hits the first router in the path; this router will then respond
   with an ICMP Time Exceeded Message (TEM) indicating that the datagram
   has expired. Another three UDP messages are now sent, each with the
   TTL value set to 2, which causes the second router to return ICMP

   TEMs. This process continues until the packets actually reach the
   other destination. Since these datagrams are trying to access an
   invalid port at the destination host, ICMP Destination Unreachable
   Messages are returned indicating an unreachable port; this event
   signals the Traceroute program that it is finished!  The Traceroute
   program displays the round-trip delay associated with each of the
   attempts. (Note that some current implementations of Traceroute use
   the Record-Route option in IP rather than the method described
   above.)

   As an aside, Traceroute did not begin life as a general-purpose
   utility, but as a quick-and-dirty debugging aid used to find a
   routing problem.  The code (complete with comments!) is available by
   anonymous FTP in the file traceroute.tar.Z from the host
   ftp.ee.lbl.gov. (See <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> for a discussion of anonymous FTP.)

   The two most basic tools for Internet applications are TELNET and the
   File Transfer Protocol (FTP). TELNET allows a user to login to a
   remote host over a TCP/IP network, while FTP, as the name implies,
   allows a user to move files between two TCP/IP hosts. These two
   utilities date back to the very early days of the ARPANET.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20TELNET"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>. TELNET</span>

   TELNET [<a href="#ref-27" title='"TELNET Protocol Specification,"'>27</a>] is TCP/IP's virtual terminal protocol. Using TELNET, a
   user connected to one host can login to another host, appearing like
   a directly-attached terminal at the remote system; this is TCP/IP's
   definition of a virtual terminal. The general form of the TELNET
   command is:

      telnet [IP_address|host_name] [port]

   As shown, a TELNET connection is initiated when the user enters the
   telnet command and supplies either a host_name or IP_address; if
   neither are given, TELNET will ask for one once the application
   begins.

   In the example below, a user of a PC uses TELNET to attach to the
   remote host smcvax.smcvt.edu. Once logged in via TELNET, the user can
   do anything on the remote host that would be possible if connected
   via a directly-attached terminal or via modem. The commands that are
   subsequently used are those available on the remote system to which
   the user is attached. In the sample dialogue below, the user attached
   to SMCVAX will use basic VAX/VMS commands:

      o The dir command lists the files having a "COM" file extension.
      o The mail command enters the VMS MAIL subsystem; the dir command
      here lists waiting mail.
      o Ping checks the status of another host.

   When finished, the logout command logs the user off the remote host;
   TELNET automatically closes the connection to the remote host and
   returns control to the local system.

   It is important to note that TELNET is a very powerful tool, one that
   may provide users with access to many Internet utilities and services
   that might not be otherwise available. Many of these features are
   accessed by specifying a port number with the TELNET command, in
   addition to a host's address, and knowledge of port numbers provides
   another mechanism for users to access information with TELNET.

   This guide discusses several TCP/IP and Internet utilities that require
   local client software, such as Finger, Whois, Archie, and Gopher. But
   what if your software does not include a needed client?  In some cases,
   TELNET may be used to access a remote client and provide the same
   functionality.

   This is done by specifying a port number with the TELNET command. Just
   as TCP/IP hosts have a unique IP address, applications on the host are
   associated with an address, called a port. Finger (see <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>
   above), for example, is associated with the well-known port number 79.
   In the absence of a Finger client, TELNETing to port 79 at a remote host
   may provide the same information. You can finger another host with
   TELNET by using a command like:

                            telnet host_name 79

   Other well-known TCP port numbers include 25 (Simple Mail Transfer
   Protocol), 43 (whois), 80 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and 119
   (Network News Transfer Protocol).

   Some services are available on the Internet using TELNET and special
   port numbers. A geographical information database, for example, may
   be accessed by TELNETing to port 3000 at host martini.eecs.umich.edu
   and current weather information is available at port 3000 at host
   downwind.sprl.umich.edu.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20FTP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>. FTP</span>

   FTP [<a href="#ref-26" title='"File Transfer Protocol (FTP),"'>26</a>] is one of the most useful and powerful TCP/IP utilities for
   the general user. FTP allows users to upload and download files
   between local and remote hosts. Anonymous FTP, in particular, is
   commonly available at file archive sites to allow users to access
   files without having to pre-establish an account at the remote host.
   TELNET might, in fact, be used for this purpose but TELNET gives the
   user complete access to the remote system; FTP limits the user to
   file transfer activities.

   The general form of the FTP command is:

         ftp [IP_address|host_name]

   An FTP session can be initiated in several ways. In the example shown
   below, an FTP control connection is initiated to a host (the Defense
   Data Network's Network Information Center) by supplying a host name
   with the FTP command; optionally, the host's IP address in dotted
   decimal (numeric) form could be used. If neither host name nor IP
   address are supplied in the command line, a connection to a host can
   be initiated by typing open host_name or open IP_address once the FTP
   application has been started.

   The remote host will ask for a username and password. If a bona fide
   registered user of this host supplies a valid username and password,
   then the user will have access to any files and directories to which
   this username has privilege. For anonymous FTP access, the username
   anonymous is used. Historically, the password for the anonymous user
   (not shown in actual use) has been guest, although most systems today
   ask for the user's Internet e-mail address (and several sites attempt
   to verify that packets are coming from that address before allowing
   the user to login).

   The "help ?" command may be used to obtain a list of FTP commands and
   help topics available with your software; although not always shown,
   nearly all TCP/IP applications have a help command. An example of the
   help for FTP's type command is shown in the sample dialogue. This
   command is very important one, by the way; if transferring a binary
   or executable file, be sure to set the type to image (or binary on
   some systems).

   The dir command provides a directory listing of the files in the
   current directory at the remote host; the UNIX ls command may also
   usually be used. Note that an FTP data transfer connection is
   established for the transfer of the directory information to the
   local host. The output from the dir command will show a file listing
   that is consistent with the native operating system of the remote

   host. Although the TCP/IP suite is often associated with UNIX, it can
   (and does) run with nearly all common operating systems. The
   directory information shown in the sample dialogue happens to be in
   UNIX format and includes the following information:

      o File attributes. The first character identifies the type of file
      entry as a directory (d), link or symbolic name (l), or individual
      file (-). The next nine characters are the file access permissions
      list; the first three characters are for the owner, the next three
      for the owner's group, and the last three for all other users.
      Three access privileges may be assigned to each file for each of
      these roups: read (r), write (w), and execute (x).
      o Number of entries, or hard links, in this structure. This value
      will be a "1" if the entry refers to a file or link, or will be
      the number of files in the listed directory.
      o File owner
      o File owner's group.
      o File size, in bytes.
      o Date and time of last modification. If the date is followed by a
      timestamp, then the date is from the current year.
      o File name.

   After the directory information has been transferred, FTP closes the
   data transfer connection.

   The command cd is used to change to another working directory, in
   this case the rfc directory (note that file and directory names may
   be case-sensitive). As in DOS, "cd .." will change to the parent of
   the current directory. The CWD command successful is the only
   indication that the user's cd command was correctly executed; the
   show-directory (may be truncated to fewer characters, as shown)
   command, if available, may be used to see which working directory you
   are in.

   Another dir command is used to find all files with the name
   <a href="rfc173.html">rfc173</a>*.txt; note the use of the * wildcard character. We can now
   copy (download) the file of choice (<a href="rfc1739.html">RFC 1739</a> is the previous version
   of this primer) by using the get (or receive) command, which has the
   following general format:

      get remote_file_name local_file_name

   FTP opens another data transfer connection for this file transfer
   purpose; note that the effective data transfer rate is 93.664 kbps.

   FTP's put (or send) command allows uploading from the local host to
   the remote. Put is often not available when using anonymous FTP.

   Finally, we terminate the FTP connection by using the close command.
   The user can initiate another FTP connection using the open command
   or can leave FTP by issuing a quit command. Quit can also be used to
   close a connection and terminate a session.

   TECHNICAL NOTE: It is important to note that different FTP packages
   have different commands available and even those with similar names
   may act differently. In the example shown here (using MultiNet for
   VMS), the show command will display the current working directory; in
   FTP Software's OnNet, show will display a file from the remote host
   at the local host. Some packages have nothing equivalent to either of
   these commands.

   Finding other users on the Internet is an art, not a science.
   Although there is a distributed database listing all of the 16+
   million hosts on the Internet, no similar database yet exists for the
   tens of millions of users. While many commercial ISPs provide
   directories of the users of their network, these databases are not
   yet linked. The paragraphs below will discuss some of the tools
   available for finding users on the Internet.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20WHOIS%2FNICNAME"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>. WHOIS/NICNAME</span>

   WHOIS and NICNAME are TCP/IP applications that search databases to
   find the name of network and system administrators, RFC authors,
   system and network points-of-contact, and other individuals who are
   registered in appropriate databases. The original NICNAME/WHOIS
   protocol is described in <a href="rfc954.html">RFC 954</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"NICNAME/WHOIS,"'>10</a>].

   WHOIS may be accessed by TELNETing to an appropriate WHOIS server and
   logging in as whois (no password is required); the most common
   Internet name server is located at the Internet Network Information
   Center (InterNIC) at rs.internic.net. This specific database only

   contains INTERNET domains, IP network numbers, and domain points of
   contact; policies governing the InterNIC database are described in
   <a href="rfc1400.html">RFC 1400</a> [<a href="#ref-31" title='"Transition and Modernization of the Internet Registration Service,"'>31</a>].  The MILNET database resides at nic.ddn.mil and PSI's
   White Pages pilot service is located at psi.com.

   Many software packages contain a WHOIS/NICNAME client that
   automatically establishes the TELNET connection to a default name
   server database, although users can usually specify any name server
   database that they want.

   The accompanying dialogues shows several types of WHOIS/NICNAME
   information queries. In the session below, we request information
   about an individual (Denis Stratford) by using WHOIS locally, a
   specific domain (hill.com) by using NICNAME locally, and a network
   address (199.182.20.0) and high-level domain (com) using TELNET to a
   WHOIS server.

   KNOWBOT is an automated username database search tool that is related
   to WHOIS. The Knowbot Information Service (KIS), operated by the
   Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,
   Virginia, provides a simple WHOIS-like interface that allows users to
   query several Internet user databases (White Pages services) all at
   one time. A single KIS query will automatically search the InterNIC,
   MILNET, MCImail, and PSI White Pages Pilot Project; other databases
   may also be included.

   KNOWBOT may be accessed by TELNETing to host info.cnri.reston.va.us.
   The help command will supply sufficient information to get started.
   The sample dialogue below shows use of the query command to locate a
   user named "Steven Shepard"; this command automatically starts a
   search through the default set of Internet databases.

   File transfer, remote login, and electronic mail remained the primary
   applications of the ARPANET/Internet until the early 1990s. But as
   the Internet user population shifted from hard-core computer
   researchers and academics to more casual users, easier-to-use tools
   were needed for the Net to become accepted as a useful resource. That
   means making things easier to find. This section will discuss some of
   the early tools that made it easier to locate and access information
   on the Internet.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1.%20Archie"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a>. Archie</span>

   Archie, developed in 1992 at the Computer Science Department at
   McGill University in Montreal, allows users to find software, data,
   and other information files that reside at anonymous FTP archive
   sites; the name of the program, reportedly, is derived from the word
   "archive" and not from the comic book character. Archie tracks the
   contents of several thousand anonymous FTP sites containing millions
   of files. The archie server automatically updates the information
   from each registered site about once a month, providing relatively
   up-to-date information without unduly stressing the network. Archie,
   however, is not as popular as it once was and many sites have not
   updated their information; as the examples below show, many of the
   catalog listings are several years old.

   Before using archie, you must identify a server address. The sites
   below all support archie; most (but not all) archie sites support the
   servers command which lists all known archie servers. Due to the
   popularity of archie at some sites and its high processing demands,
   many sites limit access to non-peak hours and/or limit the number of
   simultaneous archie users. Available archie sites include:

     archie.au                       archie.rediris.es
     archie.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at      archie.luth.se
     archie.univie.ac.at             archie.switch.ch
     archie.uqam.ca                  archie.ncu.edu.tw
     archie.funet.fi                 archie.doc.ic.ac.uk
     archie.th-darmstadt.de          archie.unl.edu
     archie.ac.il                    archie.internic.net
     archie.unipi.it                 archie.rutgers.edu
     archie.wide.ad.jp               archie.ans.net
     archie.kr                       archie.sura.net
     archie.sogang.ac.kr

   All archie sites can be accessed using archie client software. Some
   archie servers may be accessed using TELNET; when TELNETing to an
   archie site, login as archie (you must use lower case) and hit
   &lt;ENTER&gt; if a password is requested.

   Once connected, the help command assists users in obtaining more
   information about using archie. Two more useful archie commands are
   prog, used to search for files in the database, and whatis, which
   searches for keywords in the program descriptions.

   In the accompanying dialogue, the set maxhits command is used to
   limit the number of responses to any following prog commands; if this
   is not done, the user may get an enormous amount of information.  In
   this example, the user issues a request to find entries related to
   "dilbert"; armed with this information, a user can use anonymous FTP
   to examine these directories and files.

   The next request is for files with "tcp/ip" as a keyword descriptor.
   These responses can be used for subsequent prog commands.

   Exit archie using the exit command. At this point, TELNET closes the
   connection and control returns to the local host.

   Additional information about archie can be obtained by sending e-mail
   to Bunyip Information Systems (archie-info@bunyip.com). Client
   software is not required to use archie, but can make life a little
   easier; some such software can be downloaded using anonymous FTP from
   the /pub/archie/clients/ directory at ftp.sura.net (note that the
   newest program in this directory is dated June 1994). Most shareware
   and commercial archie clients hide the complexity described in this
   section; users usually connect to a pre-configured archie server
   merely by typing an archie command line.

   host can be organized in a hierarchical fashion using simple text
   descriptions, allowing files to be perused using a simple menu
   system.  Gopher also allows a user to view a file on demand without
   requiring additional file transfer protocols. In addition, Gopher
   introduced the capability of linking sites on the Internet, so that
   each Gopher site can be used as a stepping stone to access other
   sites and reducing the amount of duplicate information and effort on
   the network.

   Any Gopher site can be accessed using Gopher client software (or a
   WWW browser). In many cases, users can access Gopher by TELNETing to
   a valid Gopher location; if the site provides a remote Gopher client,
   the user will see a text-based, menu interface. The number of Gopher
   sites grew rapidly between 1991 and 1994, although growth tapered due
   to the introduction of the Web; in any case, most Gopher sites have a
   menu item that will allow you to identify other Gopher sites. If
   using TELNET, login with the username gopher (this must be in
   lowercase); no password is required.

   In the sample dialogue below, the user attaches to the Gopher server
   at the Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC) by TELNETing to
   ds.internic.net. With the menu interface shown here, the user merely
   follows the prompts. Initially, the main menu will appear. Selecting
   item 3 causes Gopher to seize and display the "InterNIC Registration
   Services (NSI)" menu; move to the desired menu item by typing the
   item number or by moving the pointer (--&gt;) down to the desired entry
   using the DOWN-ARROW key on the keyboard, and then hitting ENTER. To
   quit the program at any time, press q (quit); ? and u will provide
   help or go back up to the previous menu, respectively. Users may also
   search for strings within files using the / command or download the
   file being interrogated using the D command.

   Menu item 1 within the first submenu (selected in the dialogue shown
   here) is titled "InterNIC Registration Archives." As its submenu
   implies, this is a place to obtain files containing the InterNIC's
   domain registration policies, domain data, registration forms, and
   other information related to registering names and domains on the
   Internet.

   The problem with being blessed with so much information from FTP,
   archie, Gopher, and other sources is exactly that -- too much
   information. To make it easier for users to locate the system on
   which their desired information resides, a number of other tools have
   been created.

   VERONICA (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized
   Archives) was developed at the University of Nevada at Reno as an
   archie- like adjunct to Gopher. As the number of Gopher sites quickly
   grew after its introduction, it became increasingly harder to find
   information in gopherspace since Gopher was designed to search a
   single database at a time. VERONICA maintains an index of titles of
   Gopher items and performs a keyword search on all of the Gopher sites
   that it has knowledge of and access to, obviating the need for the
   user to perform a menu-by-menu, site-by-site search for information.
   When a user selects an item from the menu of a VERONICA search,
   "sessions" are automatically established with the appropriate Gopher
   servers, and a list of data items is returned to the originating
   Gopher client in the form of a Gopher menu so that the user can
   access the files. VERONICA is available as an option on many Gopher
   servers.

   Another Gopher-adjunct is JUGHEAD (Jonzy's Universal Gopher Hierarchy
   Excavation And Display). JUGHEAD supports key word searches and the
   use of logical operators (AND, OR, and NOT). The result of a JUGHEAD
   search is a display of all menu items which match the search string
   which are located in the University of Manchester and UMIST
   Information Server, working from a static database that is re-created
   every day. JUGHEAD is available from many Gopher sites, although
   VERONICA may be a better tool for global searches.

   The Wide Area Information Server (WAIS, pronounced "ways") was
   initiated jointly by Apple Computer, Dow Jones, KMPG Peat Marwick,
   and Thinking Machines Corp. It is a set of free-ware, share-ware, and
   commercial software products for a wide variety of hardware/software
   platforms, which work together to help users find information on the
   Internet. WAIS provides a single interface through which a user can

   access many different information databases. The user interface
   allows a query to be formulated in English and the WAIS server will
   automatically choose the appropriate databases to search. Further
   information about WAIS can be obtained by reading the WAIS FAQ, from
   host rtfm.mit.edu in file /pub/usenet/news.answers/wais-faq.

   The World Wide Web (WWW) is thought (erroneously) by many to be the
   same thing as the Internet. But the confusion, in many ways, is
   justified; by early 1996, the WWW accounted for over 40% of all of
   the traffic on the Internet. In addition, the number of hosts on the
   Internet named www has grown from several hundred in mid-1994 to
   17,000 in mid-1995 to 212,000 in mid-1996 to over 410,000 by early
   1997. The Web has made information on the Internet accessible to
   users of all ages and computer skill levels. It has provided a
   mechanism so that nearly anyone can become a content provider.
   According to some, growth in the number of WWW users is unparalleled
   by any other event in human history.

   The WWW was developed in the early 1990s at the CERN Institute for
   Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland. The Web was designed to
   combine aspects of information retrieval with multimedia
   communications, unlike archie and Gopher, which were primarily used
   for the indexing of text-based files. The Web allows users to access
   information in many different types of formats, including text,
   sound, image, animation, and video. WWW treats all searchable
   Internet files as hypertext documents.  Hypertext is a term which
   merely refers to text that contains pointers to other text, allowing
   a user reading one document to jump to another document for more
   information on a given topic, and then return to the same location in
   the original document. WWW hypermedia documents are able to employ
   images, sound, graphics, video, and animation in addition to text.

   To access WWW servers, users must run client software called a
   browser.  The browser and server use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP/1.0,"'>3</a>].  WWW documents are written in the Hypertext Markup
   Language (HTML) [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0,"'>2</a>, <a href="#ref-20" title="&quot;A Beginner's Guide to HTML.&quot;">20</a>], a simple text-based formatting language that
   is hardware and software platform-independent. Users point the
   browser at some location using a shorthand format called a Uniform
   Resource Locator (URL), which allows a WWW servers to obtain files
   from any location on the public Internet using a variety of
   protocols, including HTTP, FTP, Gopher, and TELNET.

   Mosaic, developed in 1994 at the National Center for Supercomputer
   Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
   Champaign, was the first widely-used browser. Because it was
   available at no cost over the Internet via anonymous FTP, and had a

   version for Windows, Mac, and UNIX systems, Mosaic was probably the
   single reason that the Web attracted so many users so quickly. The
   most commonly used browsers today include the Netscape Navigator
   (<a href="http://www.netscape.com/">http://www.netscape.com</a>), Microsoft's Internet Explorer
   (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com</a>), and NCSA Mosaic
   (<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/">http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/</a>).

   The WWW is ideally suited to a windows environment, or other point-
   and-click graphical user interface. Nevertheless, several text-based
   Web browsers do exist, although their usefulness is limited if trying
   to obtain graphical images, or audio or video clips. One text-based
   Web browser is Lynx, and an example of its use is shown below. Items
   in square brackets in the sample dialogue are Lynx's way of
   indicating an image or other display that cannot be shown on an ASCII
   terminal.

   As more and more protocols have become available to identify files,
   archive and server sites, news lists, and other information resources
   on the Internet, it was inevitable that some shorthand would arise to
   make it easier to designate these sources. The common shorthand
   format is called the Uniform Resource Locator. The list below
   provides information on how the URL format should be interpreted for
   the protocols and resources that will be discussed in this document.
   A complete description of the URL format may be found in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Uniform Resource Locators (URL),"'>4</a>].

  file://host/directory/file-name
       Identifies a specific file. E.g., the file htmlasst in the edu
     directory at host ftp.cs.da would be denoted, using the full URL
     form:  &lt;URL:file://ftp.cs.da/edu/htmlasst&gt;.

  <a href="ftp://user:password@host:port/directory/file-name">ftp://user:password@host:port/directory/file-name</a>
       Identifies an FTP site. E.g.:
     <a href="ftp://ftp.eff/">ftp://ftp.eff</a>.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Crypto/*.

  gopher://host:port/gopher-path
       Identifies a Gopher site and menu path; a "00" at the start of
     the path indicates a directory and "11" indicates a file. E.g.:
     gopher://info.umd.edu:901/00/info/Government/Factbook92.

  <a href="http://host:port/directory/file-name?searchpart">http://host:port/directory/file-name?searchpart</a>
       Identifies a WWW server location. E.g.:
     <a href="http://info.isoc.org/home.html">http://info.isoc.org/home.html</a>.

  mailto:e-mail_address
       Identifies an individual's Internet mail address. E.g.:
     mailto:s.shepard@hill.com.

  telnet://user:password@host:port/
       Identifies a TELNET location (the trailing "/" is optional).
     E.g.: telnet://envnet:henniker@envnet.gsfc.nasa.gov.

   While finding users on the Internet remains somewhat like alchemy if
   using the tools and utilities mentioned earlier, the Web has added a
   new dimension to finding people. Since 1995, many telephone companies
   have placed national white and yellow page telephone directories on-
   line, accessible via the World Wide Web.

   For a while, it seemed that the easiest and most reliable approach to
   finding people's e-mail address on the Internet was to look up their
   telephone number on the Web, call them, and ask for their e-mail
   address! More recently, however, many third parties are augmenting
   the standard telephone directory with an e-mail directory. These
   services primarily rely on users voluntarily registering, resulting
   in incomplete databases because most users don't know about all of
   the services.  Nevertheless, some of the personal directory services
   available via the Web with which e-mail addresses (and telephone
   numbers) can be found include Four11 Directory Services
   (<a href="http://www.four11.com/">http://www.Four11.com/</a>), Excite
   (<a href="http://www.excite.com/Reference/locators.html">http://www.excite.com/Reference/locators.html</a>), and Yahoo! People
   Search (<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/search/people/">http://www.yahoo.com/search/people/</a>).

   In addition, the Knowbot Information Service (KIS), CNRI's automated
   username database search tool described earlier in this document, is
   also available on the Web, at <a href="http://info.cnri.reston.va.us/kis.html">http://info.cnri.reston.va.us/kis.html</a>.
   Users can select several options for the KIS search, including the
   InterNIC, MILNET, MCImail, and Latin American Internic databases;
   UNIX finger and whois servers; and X.500 databases.

   Many of the other utilities described earlier in this document can
   also be accessed via the WWW. In general, the Web browser acts as a
   viewer to a remote client rather than requiring specialized software
   on the user's system.

   Several sites provide DNS information, obviating the need for a user
   to have a local DNS client such as NSLOOKUP. The hosts
   <a href="http://ns1.milepost.com/dns/">http://ns1.milepost.com/dns/</a> and
   <a href="http://sh1.ro.com/~mprevost/netutils/dig.html">http://sh1.ro.com/~mprevost/netutils/dig.html</a> are among the best DNS
   sites, allowing the user to access all DNS information. The site
   <a href="http://www.bankes.com/nslookup.htm">http://www.bankes.com/nslookup.htm</a> allows users to do multiple,
   sequential searches at a given domain.  Other Web sites providing
   simple DNS name/address translation services include
   <a href="http://rhinoceros.cs.inf.shizuoka.ac.jp/dns.html">http://rhinoceros.cs.inf.shizuoka.ac.jp/dns.html</a>,

   Ping is another service available on the Web. The
   <a href="http://sh1.ro.com/~mprevost/netutils/ping.html">http://sh1.ro.com/~mprevost/netutils/ping.html</a> page allows a user to
   select a host name, number of times to ping (1-10), and number of
   seconds between each ping (1-10), and returns a set of summary
   statistics. Other Web-based ping sites include
   <a href="http://www.net.cmu.edu/bin/ping">http://www.net.cmu.edu/bin/ping</a> (sends ten pings, and reports the
   times and min/max/avg summary statistics) and
   <a href="http://www.uia.ac.be/cc/ping.html">http://www.uia.ac.be/cc/ping.html</a> (indicates whether the target host
   is alive or not).

   Traceroute is also available on the Web. Unfortunately, these servers
   trace the route from their host to a host that the user chooses,

   Among the most useful features of the Internet are the discussion
   lists that have become available to allow individuals to discuss
   topics of mutual concern. Discussion list topics range from SCUBA
   diving and home brewing of beer to AIDS research and foreign policy.
   Several, naturally, deal specifically with the Internet, TCP/IP
   protocols, and the impact of new technologies.

   Most of the discussion lists accessible from the Internet are
   unmoderated, meaning that anyone can send a message to the list's
   central repository and the message will then be automatically
   forwarded to all subscribers of the list. These lists provide very
   fast turn-around between submission of a message and delivery, but
   often result in a lot of messages (including inappropriate junk mail,
   or "spam"). A moderated list has an extra step; a human list
   moderator examines all messages before they are forwarded to ensure
   that the messages are appropriate to the list and not needlessly
   inflammatory!

   Users should be warned that some lists generate a large number of
   messages each day. Before subscribing to too many lists, be sure that
   you are aware of local policies and/or charges governing access to
   discussion lists and e-mail storage.

   Mail can be sent to almost all Internet lists at an address with the
   following form:

         list_name@host_name

   The common convention when users want to subscribe, unsubscribe, or
   handle any other administrative matter is to send a message to the
   list administrator; do not send administrivia to the main list
   address!  The list administrator can usually be found at:

      list_name-REQUEST@host_name

   To subscribe to a list, it is often enough to place the word
   "subscribe" in the main body of the message, although a line with the
   format:

      subscribe list_name your_full_name

   will satisfy most mail servers. A similar message may be used to get
   off a list; just use the word "unsubscribe" followed by the list
   name. Not every list follows this convention, but it is a safe bet if
   you don't have better information!

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.2.%20LISTSERV"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" name="section-8.2">8.2</a>. LISTSERV</span>

   A large set of discussion groups is maintained using a program called
   LISTSERV. LISTSERV is a service provided widely on BITNET and EARN,
   although it is also available to Internet users. A LISTSERV User
   Guide can be found on the Web at <a href="http://www.earn.net/lug/notice.html">http://www.earn.net/lug/notice.html</a>.

   Mail can be sent to most LISTSERV lists at an address with the
   following form:

      list_name@host_name

   The common convention when users want to subscribe, unsubscribe, or
   handle any other administrative matter is to send commands in a
   message to the LISTSERV server; do not send administrivia to the main
   list address!  The list server can usually be found at:

      LISTSERV@host_name

   LISTSERV commands are placed in the main body of e-mail messages sent
   to an appropriate list server location. Once you have found a list of
   interest, you can send a message to the appropriate address with any
   appropriate command, such as:


     subscribe  list_name  your_full_name Subscribe to a list
     unsubscribe  list_name               Unsubscribe from a list
     help                                 Get help &amp; a list of commands
     index                                Get a list of LISTSERV files
     get  file_name                       Obtain a file from the server

   Majordomo is another popular list server for Internet discussion
   lists.  The Web site <a href="http://www.greatcircle.com/majordomo/">http://www.greatcircle.com/majordomo/</a> has a
   large amount of information about Majordomo.

   Usenet, also known as NETNEWS or Usenet news, is another information
   source with its own set of special interest mailing lists organized
   into newsgroups. Usenet originated on UNIX systems but has migrated
   to many other types of hosts. Usenet clients, called newsreaders, use
   the Network News Transfer Protocol [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Network News Transfer Protocol,"'>13</a>] and are available for
   virtually any operating system; several web browsers, in fact, have
   this capability built in.

   While Usenet newsgroups are usually accessible at Internet sites, a
   prospective Usenet client host must have appropriate newsreader
   software to be able to read news. Users will have to check with their
   local host or network administrator to find out what Usenet
   newsgroups are locally available, as well as the local policies for
   using them.

   Usenet newsgroup names are hierarchical in nature. The first part of
   the name, called the hierarchy, provides an indication about the
   general subject area. There are two types of hierarchies, called
   mainstream and alternative; the total number of newsgroups is in the
   thousands. The news.announce.newusers newsgroup is a good place for
   new Usenet users to find a detailed introduction to the use of
   Usenet, as well as an introduction to its culture.

   Usenet mainstream hierarchies are established by a process that
   requires the approval of a majority of Usenet members. Most sites
   that receive a NETNEWS feed receive all of these hierarchies, which
   include:

       comp      Computers
       misc      Miscellaneous
       news      Network news
       rec       Recreation
       sci       Science
       soc       Social issues
       talk      Various discussion lists

   The alternative hierarchies include lists that may be set up at any
   site that has the server software and disk space. These lists are not
   formally part of Usenet and, therefore, may not be received by all
   sites getting NETNEWS. The alternative hierarchies include:

       alt       Alternate miscellaneous discussion lists
       bionet    Biology, medicine, and life sciences
       bit       BITNET discussion lists
       biz       Various business-related discussion lists

   Armed with the rules for signing up for a discussion list or

   one's interests?

   There are tens of thousands of e-mail discussion lists on the
   Internet.  One List of Lists may be found using anonymous FTP at
   <a href="ftp://sri.com/netinfo/interest-groups">ftp://sri.com/netinfo/interest-groups</a>.txt; the List of Lists can be
   searched using a Web browser by going to

   To obtain a list of LISTSERV lists, send e-mail to
   listserv@bitnic.cren.net with the command lists global in the body of
   the message. Alternatively, look on the Web at
   <a href="http://www.tile.net/tile/listserv/index.html">http://www.tile.net/tile/listserv/index.html</a>. The Web site
   <a href="http://www.liszt.com/">http://www.liszt.com</a> has a Mailing Lists Database of lists served by
   LISTSERV and Majordomo.

   There are also thousands of Usenet newsgroups. One Usenet archive can
   be found at gopher://rtfm.mit.edu/11//pub/usenet/news.answers; see
   the /active-newsgroups and /alt-hierarchies subdirectories. Usenet
   news may also be read at gopher://gopher.bham.ac.uk/11/Usenet. A good
   Usenet search facility can be found at DejaNews at
   <a href="http://www.dejanews/">http://www.dejanews</a>.com/; messages can also be posted to Usenet
   newsgroups from this site.

   Note that there is often some overlap between Usenet newsgroups and
   Internet discussion lists. Some individuals join both lists in these
   circumstances or, often, there is cross-posting of messages. Some
   Usenet newsgroup discussions are forwarded onto an Internet mailing
   list by an individual site to provide access to those users who do
   not have Usenet available.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20Internet%20Documentation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>. Internet Documentation</span>

   To fully appreciate and understand what is going on within the
   Internet community, users might wish to obtain the occasional
   Internet specification. The main body of Internet documents are
   Request for Comments (RFCs), although a variety of RFC subsets have
   been defined for various specific purposes. The sections below will
   describe the RFCs and other documentation, and how to get them.

   The Internet standardization process is alluded to in the following
   sections. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the guiding
   body for Internet standards; their Web site is <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">http://www.ietf.org</a>.
   The IETF operates under the auspices of the Internet Society (ISOC),
   which has a Web site at <a href="http://www.isoc.org/">http://www.isoc.org</a>. For complete, up-to-date
   information on obtaining Internet documentation, go to the InterNIC's
   Web site at <a href="http://ds.internic.net/ds/dspg0intdoc.html">http://ds.internic.net/ds/dspg0intdoc.html</a>. The IETF's
   history and role in the Internet today is described in Kessler [<a href="#ref-15" title="&quot;IETF-History, Background, and Role in Today's Internet.&quot;">15</a>].
   For information on the organizations involved in the IETF standards
   process, see <a href="rfc2028.html">RFC 2028</a> [<a href="#ref-11" title='"The Organizations Involved in the IETF Standards Process,"'>11</a>]. For information on the relationship
   between the IETF and ISOC, see <a href="rfc2031.html">RFC 2031</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"IETF-ISOC Relationship,"'>12</a>].

   RFCs are the body of literature comprising Internet protocols,
   standards, research questions, hot topics, humor (especially those
   dated 1 April), and general information. Each RFC is uniquely issued



<span class="grey">Kessler &amp;  Shepard           Informational                     [Page 41]</span></pre>

   a number which is never reused or reissued; if a document is revised,
   it is given a new RFC number and the old RFC is said to be obsoleted.
   Announcements are sent to the RFC-DIST mailing list whenever a new
   RFC is issued; anyone may join this list by sending e-mail to
   majordomo@zephyr.isi.edu with the line "subscribe rfc-dist" in the
   body of the message.

   RFCs may be obtained through the mail (i.e., postal service), but it
   is easier and faster to get them on-line. One easy way to obtain RFCs
   on-line is to use RFC-INFO, an e-mail-based service to help users
   locate and retrieve RFCs and other Internet documents. To use the
   service, send e-mail to rfc-info@isi.edu and leave the Subject: field
   blank; commands that may go in the main body of the message include:

     help                            (Help file)
     help: ways_to_get_rfcs          (Help file on how to get RFCs)

     RETRIEVE: RFC
        Doc-ID: RFCxxxx              (Retrieve RFC xxxx; use all 4
                                     digits)

     LIST: RFC                       (List all RFCs...)
        [options]                      (...[matching the following
                                       options])
        KEYWORDS: xxx                  (Title contains string "xxx")
        AUTHOR: xxx                    (Written by "xxx")
        ORGANIZATION: xxx              (Issued by company "xxx")
        DATED-AFTER: mmm-dd-yyyy
        DATED-BEFORE: mmm-dd-yyyy
        OBSOLETES: RFCxxxx             (List RFCs obsoleting RFC xxxx)

   Another RFC e-mail server can be found at the InterNIC. To use this
   service, send an e-mail message to mailserv@ds.internic.net, leaving
   the Subject: field blank. In the main body of the message, use one or
   more of the following commands:

     help                            (Help file)
     file /ftp/rfc/rfcNNNN.txt       (Text version of RFC NNNN)
     file /ftp/rfc/rfcNNNN.ps        (Postscript version of RFC NNNN)
     document-by-name rfcNNNN        (Text version of RFC NNNN)

   To obtain an RFC via anonymous FTP, connect to one of the RFC
   repositories listed in Table 1 using FTP. After connecting, change to
   the appropriate RFC directory (as shown in Table 1) using the cd
   command. To obtain a particular file, use the get command:

      GET RFC-INDEX.TXT  local_name       (RFC Index)
      GET RFCxxxx.TXT  local_name         (Text version of RFC xxxx)
      GET RFCxxxx.PS  local_name          (Postscript version of RFC
                                          xxxx)

   The RFC index, or a specific reference to an RFC, will indicate
   whether the RFC is available in ASCII text (.txt) or Postscript (.ps)
   format. By convention, all RFCs are available in ASCII while some are
   also available in Postscript where use of graphics and/or different
   fonts adds more information or clarity; an increasing number are also
   being converted to HTML. Be aware that the index file is very large,
   containing the citing for over 2,000 documents. Note that not all
   RFCs numbered below 698 (July 1975) are available on-line.

   Finally, the InterNIC's Web site at
   <a href="http://ds.internic.net/ds/dspg1intdoc.html">http://ds.internic.net/ds/dspg1intdoc.html</a> contains the RFC index and

   RFCs describe many aspects of the Internet. By the early 1990s,
   however, so many specifications of various protocols had been written
   that it was not always clear as to which documents represented
   standards for the Internet. For that reason, a subset of RFCs have
   been designated as STDs to identify them as Internet standards.

   Unlike RFC numbers that are never reused, STD numbers always refer to
   the latest version of the standard. UDP, for example, would be
   completely identified as "STD-6/RFC-768."  Note that STD numbers
   refer to a standard, which is not necessarily a single document; STD
   19, for example, is the NetBIOS Service Protocols standard comprising
   RFCs 1001 and 1002, and a complete citation for this standard would
   be "STD-19/RFC-001/RFC-1002."

   The availability of new STDs is announced on the RFC-DIST mailing
   list.  STD-1 [<a href="#ref-23" title='"Internet Official Protocol Standards,"'>23</a>] always refers to the latest list of "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards". The Internet standards process is
   described in <a href="rfc2026.html">RFC 2026</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3,"'>5</a>] and STD notes are explained in <a href="rfc1311.html">RFC 1311</a>
   [<a href="#ref-24" title='"Introduction to the STD Notes,"'>24</a>].

   STDs can be obtained as RFCs via anonymous FTP from any RFC
   repository.  In addition, some RFC sites (such as ds.internic.net)
   provide an STD directory so that STD documents can be found in the
   path /STD/xx.TXT, where xx refers to the STD number.

   STD documents may be obtained as RFCs using the methods described in
   <a href="#section-9.1">Section 9.1</a>. STDs may also be obtained via the RFC-INFO server using
   the RETRIEVE: STD  and Doc-ID: STDxxxx commands. Also, check out the

   The For Your Information (FYI) series of RFCs provides Internet users
   with information about many topics related to the Internet. FYI
   topics range from historical to explanatory to tutorial, and are
   aimed at the wide spectrum of people that use the Internet. The FYI
   series includes answers to frequently asked questions by both
   beginning and seasoned users of the Internet, an annotated
   bibliography of Internet books, and an explanation of the domain name
   system.

   Like the STDs, an FYI number always refers to the latest version of
   an FYI. FYI 4, for example, refers to the answers to commonly asked
   questions by new Internet users; its complete citation would be
   "FYI-4/RFC-1594."  The FYI notes are explained in FYI 1 [<a href="#ref-18" title='"F.Y.I. on F.Y.I.: Introduction to the F.Y.I. notes,"'>18</a>].

   FYIs can be obtained as RFCs via anonymous FTP from any RFC
   repository.  In addition, some RFC sites (such as ds.internic.net)
   provide an FYI directory so that FYI documents can be found in the
   path /FYI/xx.TXT, where xx refers to the FYI number.

   FYI documents may be obtained as RFCs using the methods described in
   <a href="#section-9.1">Section 9.1</a>. FYIs may also be obtained via the RFC-INFO server using
   the RETRIEVE: FYI and Doc-ID: FYIxxxx commands. Also, check out the
   InterNIC's Web site at <a href="http://www.internic.net/fyi/">http://www.internic.net/fyi/</a> for the FYI index

   Standards track RFCs are formally part of the IETF standards process,
   subject to peer review, and intended to culminate in an official
   Internet Standard. Other RFCs are published on a less formal basis
   and are not part of the IETF process. To provide a mechanism of
   publishing relevant technical information which it endorsed, the IETF
   created a new series of RFCs, called the Best Current Practices (BCP)
   series. BCP topics include variances from the Internet standards
   process and IP address allocation in private networks.

   Like the STDs and FYIs, a BCP number always refers to the latest
   version of a BCP. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp5">BCP 5</a>, for example, describes an IP address
   allocation plan for private networks; its complete citation would be
   "<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp5">BCP-5</a>/RFC-1918."  The BCP process is explained in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp1">BCP 1</a> [<a href="#ref-25" title='"Best Current Practices,"'>25</a>].

   BCP documents may be obtained as RFCs using the methods described in
   <a href="#section-9.1">Section 9.1</a>. BCPs may also be obtained via the RFC-INFO server using

   RARE, the Reseaux Associes pour la Recherche Europeenne (Association
   of European Research Networks), has a charter to promote and
   participate in the creation of a high-quality European computer
   communications infrastructure for the support of research endeavors.
   RARE member networks use Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocols
   and TCP/IP. To promote a closer relationship between RARE and the
   IETF, RARE Technical Reports (RTRs) have also been published as RFCs
   since the summer of 1993.

   RTR documents may be obtained as RFCs using the methods described in
   <a href="#section-9.1">Section 9.1</a>. RTRs may also be obtained via the RFC-INFO server using

   This guide is intended to provide the reader with a rudimentary
   ability to use the utilities that are provided by TCP/IP and the
   Internet. By now, it is clear that the user's knowledge, ability, and
   willingness to experiment are about the only limits to what can be
   accomplished.

   There are several books that will help you get started finding sites
   on the Internet, including The INTERNET Yellow Pages [<a href="#ref-9" title="H. and R. Stout. The Internet Yellow Pages">9</a>]. But much
   more timely and up-to-date information can be found on the Internet
   itself, using such search tools as Yahoo! (<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com</a>),
   Excite (<a href="http://www.excite.com/">http://www.excite.com</a>), Lycos (<a href="http://www.lycos.com/">http://www.lycos.com</a>),

   There are several other sources that cite locations from which to
   access specific information about a wide range of subjects using such
   tools as FTP, Telnet, Gopher, and WWW. One of the best periodic
   lists, and archives, is through the Scout Report, a weekly
   publication by the InterNIC's Net Scout Services Project at the
   University of Wisconsin's Computer Science Department. To receive the
   Scout Report by e-mail each week, join the mailing list by sending
   email to listserv@lists.internic.net; place the line subscribe
   scout-report your_full_name in the body of the message to receive the
   text version or use subscribe scout-report-html your_full_name to
   receive the report in HTML. The Scout Report is also available on the
   Web at <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/scout/report">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/scout/report</a> and
   <a href="http://rs.internic.net/scout/report">http://rs.internic.net/scout/report</a>, or via anonymous FTP at
   <a href="ftp://rs.internic.net/scout/">ftp://rs.internic.net/scout/</a>.

   Another list is Yanoff's Internet Services List, which may be found
   at <a href="http://www.spectracom.com/islist/">http://www.spectracom.com/islist/</a> or
   <a href="ftp://ftp.csd.uwm.edu/pub/inet.services.txt">ftp://ftp.csd.uwm.edu/pub/inet.services.txt</a>. Gary Kessler, one of the
   co-author's of this document, maintains his own eclectic
   Miscellaneous Sites List at
   <a href="http://www.together.net/~kessler/gck_site.html">http://www.together.net/~kessler/gck_site.html</a>.

   If you are looking for Internet-specific information, one good
   starting point is
   <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/">http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/</a>. The InterNIC
   is another valuable resource, with their Scout Report and Scout
   Toolkit (<a href="http://rs.internic.net/scout/toolkit">http://rs.internic.net/scout/toolkit</a>).

   There is also a fair amount of rudimentary tutorial information
   available on the Internet. The InterNIC cosponsors "The 15 Minute
   Series" (<a href="http://rs.internic.net/nic-support/15min/">http://rs.internic.net/nic-support/15min/</a>), a collection of
   free, modular, and extensible training materials on specific Internet
   topics. ROADMAP96 (<a href="http://www.ua.edu/~crispen/roadmap.html">http://www.ua.edu/~crispen/roadmap.html</a>) is a
   free, 27-lesson Internet training workshop over e-mail.

   More books and specialized articles came out about the Internet in
   1993 and 1994 than in all previous years (squared!), and that trend
   has seemed to continue into 1995, 1996, and beyond. Three books are
   worth notable mention because they do not directly relate to finding
   your way around, or finding things on, the Internet. Hafner and Lyon
   [<a href="#ref-8" title="K. and M. Lyon. Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster">8</a>] have written Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the
   Internet, a history of the development of the Advanced Research
   Projects Agency (ARPA), packet switching, and the ARPANET, focusing
   primarily on the 1960s and 1970s. While culminating with the
   APRANET's 25th Anniversary in 1994, its main thrusts are on the
   groups building the ARPANET backbone (largely BBN) and the host-to-
   host application and communication protocols (largely the Network
   Working Group). Salus' book, Casting The Net: From ARPANET to

   INTERNET and beyond... [<a href="#ref-28" title="P.H. Casting The Net: From ARPANET to INTERNET and beyond... Reading (MA): Addison-Wesley">28</a>], goes into the development of the network
   from the perspective of the people, protocols, applications, and
   networks. Including a set of "diversions," his book is a bit more
   whimsical than Hafner &amp; Lyon's. Finally, Carl Malamud has written a
   delightful book called Exploring the Internet: A Technical Travelogue
   [<a href="#ref-17" title="C. Exploring the Internet: A Technical Travelogue. Englewood Cliffs (NJ): PTR Prentice Hall">17</a>], chronicling not the history of the Internet as much as a subset
   of the people currently active in building and defining  it. This
   book will not teach you how to perform an anonymous FTP file transfer
   nor how to use Gopher, but provides insights about our network (and
   Carl's gastro-pathology) that no mere statistics can convey.
