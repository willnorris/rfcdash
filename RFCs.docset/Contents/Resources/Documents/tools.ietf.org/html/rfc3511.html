<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This document provides methodologies for the performance benchmarking
   of firewalls.  It covers four areas: forwarding, connection, latency
   and filtering.  In addition to defining tests, this document also
   describes specific formats for reporting test results.

   A previous document, "Benchmarking Terminology for Firewall
   Performance" [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Firewall Devices"'>1</a>], defines many of the terms that are used in this
   document.  The terminology document SHOULD be consulted before
   attempting to make use of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Requirements</span>

   In this document, the words that are used to define the significance
   of each particular requirement are capitalized.  These words are:

   *  "MUST" This word, or the words "REQUIRED" and "SHALL" mean that
      the item is an absolute requirement of the specification.

   *  "SHOULD" This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there
      may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this
      item, but the full implications should be understood and the case
      carefully weighed before choosing a different course.





<span class="grey">Hickman, et al.              Informational                      [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-3" id="page-3" name="page-3"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3511.html">RFC 3511</a>          Methodology for Firewall Performance        April 2003</span>


   *  "MAY" This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that this item
      is truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item
      because a particular marketplace requires it or because it
      enhances the product, for example; another vendor may omit the
      same item.

   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
   of the MUST requirements.  An implementation that satisfies all the
   MUST and all the SHOULD requirements is said to be "unconditionally
   compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST requirements but not all
   the SHOULD requirements is said to be "conditionally compliant".

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>. Scope</span>

   Firewalls can control access between networks.  Usually, a firewall
   protects a private network from public or shared network(s) to which
   it is connected.  A firewall can be as simple as a single device that
   filters packets or as complex as a group of devices that combine
   packet filtering and application-level proxy and network translation
   services.  This document focuses on benchmarking firewall
   performance, wherever possible, independent of implementation.

   Test configurations defined in this document will be confined to
   dual-homed and tri-homed as shown in figure 1 and figure 2
   respectively.

   Firewalls employing dual-homed configurations connect two networks.
   One interface of the firewall is attached to the unprotected network
   [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Firewall Devices"'>1</a>], typically the public network (Internet).  The other interface is
   connected to the protected network [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Firewall Devices"'>1</a>], typically the internal LAN.

   In the case of dual-homed configurations, servers which are made
   accessible to the public (Unprotected) network are attached to the
   private (Protected) network.

   Tri-homed [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Firewall Devices"'>1</a>] configurations employ a third segment called a
   Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).  With tri-homed configurations, servers
   accessible to the public network are attached to the DMZ.  Tri-Homed
   configurations offer additional security by separating server(s)
   accessible to the public network from internal hosts.

   Since firewall testing may involve data sources which emulate
   multiple users or hosts, the methodology uses the terms virtual
   clients/servers.  For these firewall tests, virtual clients/servers
   specify application layer entities which may not be associated with a
   unique physical interface.  For example, four virtual clients may

   participating in the test.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3%20Test%20Traffic%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a> Test Traffic Requirements</span>

   While the function of a firewall is to enforce access control
   policies, the criteria by which those policies are defined vary
   depending on the implementation.  Firewalls may use network layer,
   transport layer or, in many cases, application-layer criteria to make
   access-control decisions.

   For the purposes of benchmarking firewall performance, this document
   references HTTP 1.1 or higher as the application layer entity.  The
   methodologies MAY be used as a template for benchmarking with other
   applications.  Since testing may involve proxy based DUT/SUTs, HTTP
   version considerations are discussed in <a href="#appendix-A">appendix A</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4%20DUT%2FSUT%20Traffic%20Flows"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a> DUT/SUT Traffic Flows</span>

   Since the number of interfaces are not fixed, the traffic flows will
   be dependent upon the configuration used in benchmarking the DUT/SUT.
   Note that the term "traffic flows" is associated with client-to-
   server requests.

   For Dual-Homed configurations, there are two unique traffic flows:

      Client         Server
      ------         ------
      Protected   -&gt; Unprotected
      Unprotected -&gt; Protected

   For Tri-Homed configurations, there are three unique traffic flows:

      Client         Server
      ------         ------
      Protected -&gt;   Unprotected
      Protected -&gt;   DMZ

   One or more clients may target multiple servers for a given
   application.  Each virtual client MUST initiate connections in a
   round-robin fashion.  For example, if the test consisted of six
   virtual clients targeting three servers, the pattern would be as
   follows:

   Many firewalls implement network address translation (NAT) [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Firewall Devices"'>1</a>], a
   function which translates private internet addresses to public
   internet addresses.  This involves additional processing on the part
   of the DUT/SUT and may impact performance.  Therefore, tests SHOULD
   be ran with NAT disabled and NAT enabled to determine the performance
   differential, if any.  The test report MUST indicate whether NAT was
   enabled or disabled.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.7%20Rule%20Sets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.7" name="section-4.7">4.7</a> Rule Sets</span>

   Rule sets [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Firewall Devices"'>1</a>] are a collection of access control policies that
   determine which packets the DUT/SUT will forward and which it will
   reject [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Firewall Devices"'>1</a>].  Since criteria by which these access control policies
   may be defined will vary depending on the capabilities of the
   DUT/SUT, the following is limited to providing guidelines for
   configuring rule sets when benchmarking the performance of the
   DUT/SUT.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a rule be entered for each host (Virtual
   client).  In addition, testing SHOULD be performed using different
   size rule sets to determine its impact on the performance of the
   DUT/SUT.  Rule sets MUST be configured in a manner, such that, rules
   associated with actual test traffic are configured at the end of the
   rule set and not at the beginning.

   The DUT/SUT SHOULD be configured to deny access to all traffic which
   was not previously defined in the rule set.  The test report SHOULD
   include the DUT/SUT configured rule set(s).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.8%20Web%20Caching"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.8" name="section-4.8">4.8</a> Web Caching</span>

   Some firewalls include caching agents to reduce network load.  When
   making a request through a caching agent, the caching agent attempts
   to service the response from its internal memory.  The cache itself
   saves responses it receives, such as responses for HTTP GET requests.
   Testing SHOULD be performed with any caching agents on the DUT/SUT
   disabled.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.9%20Authentication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.9" name="section-4.9">4.9</a> Authentication</span>

   Access control may involve authentication processes such as user,
   client or session authentication.  Authentication is usually
   performed by devices external to the firewall itself, such as an
   authentication server(s) and may add to the latency of the system.
   Any authentication processes MUST be included as part of connection
   setup process.

   Some test instruments allow configuration of one or more TCP stack
   parameters, thereby influencing the traffic flows which will be
   offered and impacting performance measurements.  While this document
   does not attempt to specify which TCP parameters should be
   configurable, any such TCP parameter(s) MUST be noted in the test
   report.  In addition, when comparing multiple DUT/SUTs, the same TCP
   parameters MUST be used.

   The test instrument MUST offer unicast IP packets to the DUT/SUT at a
   constant rate.  The test MAY consist of either bi-directional or
   unidirectional traffic; for example, an emulated client may offer a
   unicast stream of packets to an emulated server, or the test
   instrument may simulate a client/server exchange by offering
   bidirectional traffic.

   This test will employ an iterative search algorithm.  Each iteration
   will involve the test instrument varying the intended load until the
   maximum rate, at which no packet loss occurs, is found.  Since
   backpressure mechanisms may be employed, resulting in the intended

   frame.  The duration of the test portion of each trial MUST be at
   least 30 seconds.

   It is RECOMMENDED to perform the throughput measurements with
   different packet sizes.  When testing with different packet sizes the
   DUT/SUT configuration MUST remain the same.

   This test will employ an iterative search algorithm to determine the
   maximum number of concurrent TCP connections supported through or
   with the DUT/SUT.

   For each iteration, the aggregate number of concurrent TCP
   connections attempted by the virtual client(s) will be varied.  The
   destination address will be that of the server or that of the NAT
   proxy.  The aggregate rate will be defined by connection attempt
   rate, and will be attempted in a round-robin fashion (See 4.5).

   To validate all connections, the virtual client(s) MUST request an
   object using an HTTP 1.1 or higher GET request.  The requests MUST be
   initiated on each connection after all of the TCP connections have
   been established.

   When testing proxy-based DUT/SUTs, the virtual client(s) MUST request
   two objects using HTTP 1.1 or higher GET requests.  The first GET
   request is required for connection time establishment [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for Firewall Devices"'>1</a>]
   measurements as specified in <a href="#appendix-B">appendix B</a>.  The second request is used
   for validation as previously mentioned.  When comparing proxy and
   non-proxy based DUT/SUTs, the test MUST be performed in the same
   manner.

   Between each iteration, it is RECOMMENDED that the test instrument
   issue a TCP RST referencing each connection attempted for the
   previous iteration, regardless of whether or not the connection
   attempt was successful.  The test instrument will wait for aging time

   This test will employ an iterative search algorithm to determine the
   maximum TCP connection tear down rate supported by the DUT/SUT.  The
   test iterates through different TCP connection tear down rates with a
   fixed number of TCP connections.

   In the case of proxy based DUT/SUTs, the DUT/SUT will itself receive
   the ACK in response to issuing a FIN packet to close its side of the
   TCP connection.  For validation purposes, the virtual client or
   server, whichever is applicable, MAY verify that the DUT/SUT received
   the final ACK by re-transmitting the final ACK.  A TCP RST should be
   received in response to the retransmitted ACK.

   Between each iteration, it is RECOMMENDED that the virtual client(s)
   or server(s), whichever is applicable, issue a TCP RST referencing
   each connection which was attempted to be torn down, regardless of
   whether or not the connection tear down attempt was successful.  The

   Each HTTP 1.1 or higher virtual client will request one or more
   objects from an HTTP 1.1 or higher server using one or more HTTP GET
   requests over each connection.  The aggregate number of connections
   attempted, defined by number of connections, MUST be evenly divided
   among all of the participating virtual clients.

   If the virtual client(s) make multiple HTTP GET requests per
   connection, it MUST request the same object size for each GET
   request.  Multiple iterations of this test may be run with objects of
   different sizes.

   Average Transfer Rate :
      The average transfer rate of the DUT/SUT MUST be measured and
      shall be referenced to the requested object(s).  The measurement
      will start on transmission of the first bit of the first requested
      object and end on transmission of the last bit of the last
      requested object.  The average transfer rate, in bits per second,
      will be calculated using the following formula:

                             OBJECTS * OBJECTSIZE * 8
   TRANSFER RATE (bit/s) =  --------------------------
                                    DURATION

   OBJECTS    - Total number of objects successfully transferred across
                all connections.

   OBJECTSIZE - Object size in bytes

   DURATION   - Aggregate transfer time based on aforementioned time
                references.

      acknowledged, the offered load [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>4</a>] will be varying.  Therefore,
      the test instrument should measure the average forwarding rate
      over the duration of the test.  Measurement should start on
      transmission of the first bit of the payload of the first datagram
      and end on transmission of the last bit of the payload of the last

   The test instrument MUST offer packets in a steady state.  As noted
   in the latency discussion in <a href="rfc2544.html">RFC 2544</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>2</a>], latency measurements MUST
   be taken at the throughput level, that is, at the highest offered
   load with zero packet loss.  Measurements taken at the throughput
   level are the only ones that can legitimately be termed latency.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers use offered loads not only at the
   throughput level, but also at load levels that are less than or
   greater than the throughput level.  To avoid confusion with existing
   terminology, measurements from such tests MUST be labeled as delay
   rather than latency.

   It is RECOMMENDED to perform the latency measurements with different
   packet sizes.  When testing with different packet sizes the DUT/SUT
   configuration MUST remain the same.

   If desired, a step test MAY be used in which offered loads increment
   or decrement through a range of load levels.

   The duration of the test portion of each trial MUST be at least 30
   seconds.

   An HTTP 1.1 or higher client will request one or more objects from an
   HTTP 1.1 or higher server using one or more HTTP GET requests.  If
   the test instrument makes multiple HTTP GET requests, it MUST request
   the same-sized object each time.  Multiple iterations of this test
   may be performed with objects of different sizes.

   Implementers MAY configure the test instrument to run for a fixed
   duration.  In this case, the test instrument MUST report the number
   of objects requested and returned for the duration of the test.  For
   fixed-duration tests it is RECOMMENDED that the duration be at least
   30 seconds.

APPENDIX A: HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

   The most common versions of HTTP in use today are HTTP/1.0 and
   HTTP/1.1 with the main difference being in regard to persistent
   connections.  HTTP 1.0, by default, does not support persistent
   connections.  A separate TCP connection is opened up for each GET
   request the client wants to initiate and closed after the requested
   object transfer is completed.  While some implementations HTTP/1.0
   supports persistence through the use of a keep-alive, there is no
   official specification for how the keep-alive operates. In addition,
   HTTP 1.0 proxies do support persistent connection as they do not
   recognize the connection header.

   HTTP/1.1, by default, does support persistent connection and is
   therefore the version that is referenced in this methodology. Proxy
   based DUT/SUTs may monitor the TCP connection and after a timeout,
   close the connection if no activity is detected.  The duration of
   this timeout is not defined in the HTTP/1.1 specification and will
   vary between DUT/SUTs.  If the DUT/SUT closes inactive connections,
   the aging timer on the DUT SHOULD be configured for a duration that
   exceeds the test time.

   While this document cannot foresee future changes to HTTP and it
   impact on the methodologies defined herein, such changes should be
   accommodated for so that newer versions of HTTP may be used in
   benchmarking firewall performance.

APPENDIX B: Connection Establishment Time Measurements

   Some connection oriented protocols, such as TCP, involve an odd
   number of messages when establishing a connection.  In the case of
   proxy based DUT/SUTs, the DUT/SUT will terminate the connection,
   setting up a separate connection to the server.  Since, in such
   cases, the test instrument does not own both sides of the connection,
   measurements will be made two different ways.  While the following
   describes the measurements with reference to TCP, the methodology may
   be used with other connection oriented protocols which involve an odd
   number of messages.

   When testing non-proxy based DUT/SUTs , the establishment time shall
   be directly measured and is considered to be from the time the first
   bit of the first SYN packet is transmitted by the client to the time
   the last bit of the final ACK in the three-way handshake is received
   by the target server.







<span class="grey">Hickman, et al.              Informational                     [Page 31]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-32" id="page-32" name="page-32"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3511.html">RFC 3511</a>          Methodology for Firewall Performance        April 2003</span>


   If the DUT/SUT is proxy based, the connection establishment time is
   considered to be from the time the first bit of the first SYN packet
   is transmitted by the client to the time the client transmits the
   first bit of the first acknowledged TCP datagram (t4-t0 in the
   following timeline).

      t0: Client sends a SYN.
      t1: Proxy sends a SYN/ACK.
      t2: Client sends the final ACK.
      t3: Proxy establishes separate connection with server.
      t4: Client sends TCP datagram to server.
      *t5: Proxy sends ACK of the datagram to client.

   * While t5 is not considered part of the TCP connection
   establishment, acknowledgement of t4 must be received for the
   connection to be considered successful.

APPENDIX C: Connection Tear Down Time Measurements

   While TCP connections are full duplex, tearing down of such
   connections are performed in a simplex fashion, that is, FIN segments
   are sent by each host/device terminating each side of the TCP
   connection.

   When making connection tear down times measurements, such
   measurements will be made from the perspective of the entity, that
   is, virtual client/server initiating the connection tear down
   request.  In addition, the measurement will be performed in the same
   manner, independent of whether or not the DUT/SUT is proxy-based. The
   connection tear down will be considered the interval between the
   transmission of the first bit of the first TCP FIN packet transmitted
   by the virtual client or server, whichever is applicable, requesting
   a connection tear down to receipt of the last bit of the
   corresponding ACK packet on the same virtual client/server interface.
