   This memo is an introductory guide to some of the TCP/IP and Internet
   tools and utilities that allow users to access the wide variety of
   information on the network, from determining if a particular host is
   up to viewing a multimedia thesis on foreign policy.  It also
   describes discussion lists accessible from the Internet, ways to
   obtain Internet documents, and resources that help users weave their
   way through the Internet.  This memo may be used as a tutorial for
   individual self-learning, a step-by-step laboratory manual for a
   course, or as the basis for a site's users manual.  It is intended as
   a basic guide only and will refer to other sources for more detailed
   information.

   This section provides descriptions and detailed examples of several
   TCP/IP utilities and applications, including actual sessions using
   these utilities (with some extraneous information removed).  Each
   section below describes a single TCP/IP-based tool, it's application,
   and, in some cases, how it works.  The text description is followed
   by an actual sample session.

   The sample dialogues shown below were made using the Multinet TCP/IP
   software for VAX/VMS or DOS versions of FTP Software's PC/TCP.  While
   the examples below can be used as a guide to using and learning about
   the capabilities of these tools, the reader should understand that
   not all of these utilities may be found at all TCP/IP hosts nor in
   all commercial software packages.  Furthermore, the user interface
   for different packages will be different and the actual command line
   may appear differently than shown here; this will be particularly
   true for graphical user interfaces running over Windows, X-Windows,
   OS/2, or Macintosh systems.  The Internet has many exciting things to
   offer but standardized interfaces to the protocols is not yet one of
   them!  This guide will not provide any detail or motivation about the
   Internet Protocol Suite; more information about the TCP/IP protocols
   and related issues may be found in <a href="rfc1180.html">RFC 1180</a> [<a href="#ref-18" title='"TCP/IP Tutorial"'>18</a>], Comer [<a href="#ref-22" title='"Internetworking with TCP/IP, Vol. I: Principles, Protocols, and Architecture"'>22</a>], Feit
   [<a href="#ref-23" title='"TCP/IP"'>23</a>], and Kessler [<a href="#ref-30" title='"An Overview of TCP/IP Protocols and the Internet"'>30</a>].

   In the commands shown in the descriptions below, any item appearing
   in square brackets ([]) is optional and the vertical-bar (|) means
   "or"; parameters appearing with no brackets or within curly brackets
   ({}) are mandatory.  In the sample dialogues, most user input is in
   capital letters (only where allowed) and lines containing user input
   are designated with a "**" in the far-left margin.

   AUTHOR'S NOTE: The sample dialogues are easier to read in the
   secondary, Postscript version of this RFC.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20NSLOOKUP"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>. NSLOOKUP</span>

   NSLOOKUP is the name server lookup program that comes with many
   TCP/IP software packages.  A user can use NSLOOKUP to examine entries
   in the Domain Name System (DNS) database that pertain to a particular
   host or domain; one common use is to determine a host system's IP
   address from its name or the host's name from its IP address.  The
   general form of the command to make a single query is:

        NSLOOKUP  [IP_address | host_name]

   If the program is started without any parameters, the user will be
   prompted for input; the user can enter either an IP address or host
   name at that time, and the program will respond with the name and
   address of the default name sever, the name server actually used to
   resolve each request, and the IP address and host name that was
   queried.  "Exit" is used to quit the NSLOOKUP application.

   Three simple queries are shown in the example below:

  1. Requests the address of the host named "emily.uvm.edu", a system at
     the University of Vermont (UVM).  As it turns out, this is not the
     true name of the host, but a shortened version of the name that is
     accepted as an alias by the network.  The full name of the host and
     the IP address are listed by NSLOOKUP.

  2. Requests the address of host "emily.emba.uvm.edu", which is the
     same host as in the first query.  Note that NSLOOKUP provides a
     "non-authoritative" answer.  Since NSLOOKUP just queried this same
     address, the information is still in its cache memory.  Rather than
     send additional messages to the name server, the answer is one that
     it remembers from before; the server didn't look up the information
     again, however, so it is not guaranteed to still be accurate
     (because the information might have changed within the last few
     milliseconds!).

  3. Requests the name of the host with the given IP address.  The
     result points to the Internet gateway to Australia,
     "munnari.oz.au".

   One additional query is shown in the dialogue below.  NSLOOKUP
   examines information that is stored by the DNS.  The default NSLOOKUP
   queries examine basic address records (called "A records") to
   reconcile the host name and IP address, although other information is
   also available.  In the final query below, for example, the user
   wants to know where electronic mail addressed to the "uvm.edu" domain

   mail exchange (MX) records by issuing a "set type" command (which
   must be in lower case).  The query shows that mail addressed to
   "uvm.edu" is handled though a mail server called "moose.uvm.edu". The
   DNS is beyond the scope of this introduction, although more
   information about the concepts and structure of the DNS can be found
   in STD 13/RFC 1034 [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities"'>12</a>] and <a href="rfc1591.html">RFC 1591</a> [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Domain Name System Structure and Delegation"'>13</a>].  The "help" command can be
   issued at the program prompt for information about NSLOOKUP's more
   advanced commands.

   TECHNICAL NOTE: There are other tools that might be available on your
   system or with your software for examining the DNS.  Alternatives to
   NSLOOKUP include HOST and DIG.

   Ping is one of the most widely available tools bundled with TCP/IP
   software packages.  Ping uses a series of Internet Control Message
   Protocol (ICMP) Echo messages to determine if a remote host is active
   or inactive, and to determine the round-trip delay in communicating
   with it.  The Ping command, referred to as the Packet Internetwork
   Groper in some references, has the following general format:

        PING [-s] {IP_address | host_name} [size] [quantity]

   In the first test below, we ping the host "thumper.bellcore.com" to
   determine whether it is up and running.  This simple use of the
   command contains no optional parameters.

   In the second test, the "-s" parameter tells the system to send an
   ICMP Echo message every second.  The optional "size" parameter
   specifies that each message should be 64 bytes in length (which is
   the default size); the optional "quantity" parameter indicates that
   this test will only send 12 messages (the default is to run the test
   continuously until interrupted).  The results of the second test
   displays the round-trip delay of each Echo message that is returned
   to the sending host; at the end of the test, summary statistics are
   displayed.

   The Finger program may be used to find out who is logged in on
   another system or to find out detailed information about a specific
   user.  This command has also introduced a brand new verb; "fingering"
   someone on the Internet is not necessarily a rude thing to do!  The
   Finger User Information Protocol is described in <a href="rfc1288.html">RFC 1288</a> [<a href="#ref-20" title='"The Finger User Information Protocol"'>20</a>].  The
   most general format of the Finger command is:

        FINGER [username]@host_name

   The first example below shows the result of fingering an individual
   user at a remote system.  The first line of the response shows the
   username, the user's real name, their process identifier,
   application, and terminal port number.  Additional information may be
   supplied at the option of the user in "plan" and/or "project" files
   that they supply; these files are often named PLAN.TXT or
   PROJECT.TXT, respectively, and reside in a user's root directory (or
   somewhere in an appropriate search path).

   The second example shows the result of fingering a remote system.
   This lists all of the processes currently running at the fingered
   system or other information, depending upon how the remote system's
   administrator set up the system to respond to the Finger command.

   Traceroute is another common TCP/IP tool, this one allowing users to
   learn about the route that packets take from their local host to a
   remote host.  Although used often by network and system managers as a
   simple, yet powerful, debugging aid, traceroute can be used by end
   users to learn something about the structure of the Internet.

   The Traceroute command has the following general format (where "#"
   represents a positive integer value associated with the qualifier):

      TRACEROUTE [-m #] [-q #] [-w #] [-p #] {IP_address | host_name}



<span class="grey">Kessler &amp; Shepard                                               [Page 7]</span></pre>

   where  -m   is the maximum allowable TTL value, measured as the
                number of hops allowed before the program terminates
               (default = 30)
          -q   is the number of UDP packets that will be sent with each
               time-to-live setting (default = 3)
          -w   is the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for an answer
               from a particular router before giving up (default = 5)
          -p   is the invalid port address at the remote host (default =
               33434)

   The Traceroute example below shows the route between a host at St.
   Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont (smcvax.smcvt.edu) and a
   host at Bellcore in Red Bank, New Jersey (thumper.bellcore.com).  The
   output has some interesting points:

   1. NEARnet, the New England Academic and Research Network, is a
      regional network serving the northeastern U.S.  The packets' route
      runs from St. Mike's NEARnet gateway (smc-gw) to the University of
      Vermont (uvm-gw), etc.  Note that some intermediate systems (see
      lines 4 and 16) do not have names associated with them.

   2. From NEARnet (lines 1-6), the packets travel on the National
      Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) T3 backbone (lines 7-11).  The
      NSFNET backbone nodes are identified as "ans.net" since the NSFNET
      is operated by Advanced Networks and Services, Inc. (ANS).  The
      packets travel within ANS' network on their core nodal switching
      subsystems ("cnss") until ready to jump off the backbone; line 11
      indicates an ANS exterior nodal switching subsystem ("enss").  The
      datagrams are then carried on the JvNCnet (lines 12-16), a regional
      network in New Jersey (note the use of SMDS!).  Finally, the
      datagrams are placed on Bellcore's internal network (lines 17 and
      18) for final delivery.

   3. Note that not all of the datagrams take the same route.  In
      particular, only two of the datagrams go through the ANS gateway
      referred to at line 10.  Note also line 17; here, the first two
      datagrams go through one router at Bellcore, while the third
      datagram goes through a companion router.

   TECHNICAL NOTE: Traceroute works by sending a sequence of User
   Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagrams to an invalid port address at the
   remote host.  Using the default settings, three datagrams are sent,
   each with a Time-To-Live (TTL) field value set to one.  The TTL value
   of 1 causes the datagram to "timeout" as soon as it hits the first
   router in the path; this router will then respond with an ICMP Time
   Exceeded Message (TEM) indicating that the datagram has expired.
   Another three UDP messages are now sent, each with the TTL value set
   to 2, which causes the second router to return ICMP TEMs.  This



<span class="grey">Kessler &amp; Shepard                                               [Page 8]</span></pre>

   process continues until the packets actually reach the other
   destination.  Since these datagrams are trying to access an invalid
   port at the destination host, ICMP Destination Unreachable Messages
   are returned indicating an unreachable port; this event signals the
   Traceroute program that it is finished!  The Traceroute program
   displays the round-trip delay associated with each of the attempts.

   As an interesting aside, Traceroute did not begin life as a general-
   purpose utility, but as a quick-and-dirty debugging aid used to find
   a routing problem.  The code (complete with comments!) is available
   by anonymous FTP in the file "traceroute.tar.Z" from the host
   "ftp.ee.lbl.gov".  (See <a href="#section-2.5">Section 2.5</a> for a discussion of anonymous
   FTP.)

   The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) [<a href="#ref-16" title='"File Transfer Protocol (FTP)'>16</a>] is one of the most useful and
   powerful TCP/IP utilities for the general user.  FTP allows users to
   upload and download files between local and remote hosts.  Anonymous
   FTP, in particular, is commonly available at file archive sites to
   allow users to access files without having to pre-establish an
   account at the remote host.  The general form of the FTP command is:

        FTP [IP_address | host_name]

   As shown, FTP can be initiated in several ways.  In the example shown
   below, an FTP control connection is initiated to a host by supplying
   a host name with the FTP command; optionally, the host's IP address
   in dotted decimal form could be used.  If neither host name nor IP
   address are supplied in the command line, a connection to a host can
   be initiated by typing "OPEN host_name" or "OPEN IP_address" once the
   FTP application has been started.

   The remote host will now ask for a username and password.  If a
   legitimate, registered user of this host supplies a valid username
   and password, then the user will have access to any files and
   directories to which this username has privilege.  For anonymous FTP
   access, the username "anonymous" is used and the password (not shown
   in actual use) is "guest" (although an increasing number of systems
   ask that anonymous FTP users supply their Internet address as the
   password).

   The first command issued in the example below is "help ?", used to
   obtain a list of available FTP commands and help topics.  Although
   not always shown, nearly all TCP/IP applications have a help command.

   An example of the help for FTP's "type" command is shown in the
   sample dialogue.  This command is very important one, by the way; if
   transferring a binary or executable file, be sure to set the type to
   "image" (or "binary" on some systems).

   The "dir" command provides a directory listing of the files in the
   current directory at the remote host; the UNIX "ls" command may also
   usually be used.  Note that an FTP data transfer connection is
   established for the transfer of the directory information to the
   local host.  The output from the "dir" command will show a file
   listing that is consistent with the native operating system of the
   remote host.  Although the TCP/IP suite is often associated with
   UNIX, it can (and does) run with nearly all common operating systems.

   The directory information shown in the sample dialogue happens to be
   in UNIX format and includes the following information:



<span class="grey">Kessler &amp; Shepard                                              [Page 10]</span></pre>

   o File attributes.  The first character identifies this as a
     directory (d), link (l), or individual file (-).  The next nine
     characters list the access permissions for three groups, namely,
     the owner, the owner's group, and all other users.  Three access
     privileges may be assigned to each file for each of these groups:
     read (r), write (w), execute (x), and/or search (s).

   o File owner and owner's group.

   o File size, in bytes.

   o Date of last modification.  If the date is followed by a timestamp,
     then the date is from the current year.

   o File name.

   After the directory information has been transferred, FTP closes the
   data transfer connection.

   The command "cd" is used to change to another directory, in this case
   the "Gov" directory (note that file and directory names may be case-
   sensitive).  As in DOS, "cd .." will change to the parent of the
   current directory.  The "CWD command successful" is the only
   indication that the user's "cd" command was correctly executed; the
   "show-directory" (may be truncated to fewer characters, as shown)
   command, if available, may be used to see which directory you are in.

   Another "dir" command is used to find all files ending with the
   characters ".act"; note the use of the "*" wildcard character.  We
   can now copy (download) the file of choice (The Fair Credit Reporting
   Act, 1992) by using the "get" (or "receive") command, which has the
   following general format:

      GET  remote_file_name  local_file_name

   FTP opens another data transfer connection for this file transfer
   purpose; note that the effective data transfer rate is 39.98 kbps.

   FTP's "put" (or "send") command allows uploading from the local host
   to the remote.  "Put" is often not available when using anonymous
   FTP.

   Finally, we terminate the FTP connection by using the "close"
   command.  The user can initiate another FTP connection using the
   "open" command or can leave FTP by issuing a "quit" command.  "Quit"
   can also be used to close a connection and terminate a session.

   TECHNICAL NOTE: It is important to note that different FTP packages
   have different commands available and even those with similar names
   may act differently.  In the example shown here (using MultiNet for
   VMS), the "show" command will display the current directory; in
   another package (e.g., FTP Software's PC/TCP), "show" will display a
   file from the remote host at the local host.  Some packages have
   nothing equivalent to either of these commands!

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.6.%20TELNET"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.6" name="section-2.6">2.6</a>. TELNET</span>

   TELNET [<a href="#ref-17" title='"TELNET Protocol Specification"'>17</a>] is TCP/IP's virtual terminal protocol.  Using TELNET, a
   user connected to one host can login to another host, appearing like
   a directly-attached terminal at the remote system; this is TCP/IP's
   definition of a "virtual terminal."  The general form of the TELNET
   command is:

        TELNET  [IP_address | host_name]  [port]

   As shown, a TELNET connection is initiated when the user enters the
   "TELNET" command and supplies either a "host_name" or "IP_address";
   if neither are given, TELNET will ask for one once the application
   begins.

   In the example below, a user logged onto a PC on a LAN will use
   TELNET to attach to the remote host "smcvax.smcvt.edu".   Once logged
   in via TELNET, the user can do anything on the remote host that they
   could do if they were on a directly-connected terminal or had dialed-
   up by modem.  The commands that are used are those available on the
   remote system to which the user is attached.  In the sample dialogue



<span class="grey">Kessler &amp; Shepard                                              [Page 14]</span></pre>

   below, the user attached to SMCVAX will use basic VAX/VMS commands:

   o  The "dir" command lists the files having a "COM" file extension.
   o  The "mail" command enters the MAIL system (there are no messages).
   o  "Pinging" the home host shows that it is alive!

   When finished, "logout" logs the user off the remote host; TELNET
   automatically closes the connection to the remote host and returns
   control to the local system.

   It is important to note that TELNET is a very powerful tool, one that
   may provide users with access to many Internet utilities and services
   that might not be otherwise available.  Many of these features are
   accessed by specifying a port number with the TELNET command, in
   addition to a host's address, and knowledge of port numbers provides
   another mechanism for users to access information with Telnet.

   This guide discusses several TCP/IP and Internet utilities that
   require local client software, such as Finger, Whois, Archie, and
   Gopher.  But what if your software does not include a needed client?
   In some cases, Telnet may be used to access a remote client and
   provide the same functionality.

   This is done by specifying a port number with the TELNET command.
   Just as TCP/IP hosts have a unique IP address, applications on the
   host are associated with an address, called a "port".  Finger, for
   example, is associated with the well-known port number 79.  In the
   absence of a Finger client, TELNETing to port 79 at a remote host may
   provide the same information.  You can "finger" another host with
   TELNET by using a command like:

                              TELNET host_name 79

   Other well-known TCP/IP port numbers include 20 (FTP data transfer),
   21 (FTP control), 25 (SMTP), 43 (whois), 70 (Gopher), and 185
   (KNOWBOT).

   Some services are available on the Internet using TELNET and special
   port numbers.  A geographical information database, for example, may
   be accessed by TELNETing to port 3000 at host
   "martini.eecs.umich.edu"; current weather information is available at
   port 3000 at hosts "downwind.sprl.umich.edu" and
   "wind.atmos.uah.edu".

   WHOIS and NICNAME are TCP/IP applications that search databases to
   find the name of network and system administrators, RFC authors,
   system and network points-of-contact, and other individuals who are
   registered in appropriate databases.  The original NICNAME/WHOIS
   protocol is described in <a href="rfc954.html">RFC 954</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"NICNAME/WHOIS"'>4</a>].

   WHOIS may be accessed by TELNETing to an appropriate WHOIS server and
   logging in as "WHOIS" (no password is required); the most common
   Internet name server is located at the Internet Network Information
   Center (InterNIC) at "rs.internic.net".  This specific database, in
   particular, only contains INTERNET domains, IP network numbers, and
   points of contact; policies governing the InterNIC database are
   described in <a href="rfc1400.html">RFC 1400</a> [<a href="#ref-19" title='"Transition and Modernization of the Internet Registration Service"'>19</a>].  The MILNET database resides at
   "nic.ddn.mil" and PSI's White Pages pilot service is located at
   "psi.com".

   Many software packages contain a WHOIS/NICNAME client that
   automatically establishes the TELNET connection to a default name
   server database, although users can usually specify any name server
   database that they want.

   The accompanying dialogues shows several types of WHOIS/NICNAME
   information queries.  In the session below, we request information
   about an individual (Denis Stratford) by using WHOIS locally, a
   specific domain (hill.com) by using NICNAME locally, and a high-level
   domain (edu) using TELNET to a WHOIS server.

   KNOWBOT is an automated username database search tool that is related
   to WHOIS.  The Knowbot Information Service (KIS) provides a simple
   WHOIS-like interface that allows users to query several Internet user
   databases (White Pages services) all at one time.  A single KIS query
   will automatically search the InterNIC, MILNET, MCImail, and PSI
   White Pages Pilot Project; other databases may also be included.

   KNOWBOT may be accessed by TELNETing to port 185 at host
   "info.cnri.reston.va.us" or "sol.bucknell.edu".  The "help" command
   will supply sufficient information to get started.  The sample
   dialogue below shows use of the "query" command to locate a user
   named "Gary Kessler"; this command automatically starts a search
   through the default set of Internet databases.

   NETFIND is another tool that may be used to locate people on the
   network.  NETFIND's advantage is that it searches for users by
   utilizing extant tools such as Finger and SMTP, thus providing the
   potential to find any user on any host without relying on databases.
   For NETFIND to be successful, however, the system manager of existing
   systems must set up Finger and SMTP to respond correctly to NETFIND's
   queries.  NETFIND is still relatively new and use will grow over
   time.

   NETFIND is a menu-driven, text-based system.  Users need to TELNET to
   an available NETFIND server.  Once connected, login as "netfind"
   (must be lower-case; no password required) and follow the menu
   prompts.  The sample dialogue below shows the search for "Tom
   Maufer", who is known to work at Goddard Space Flight Center ("gsfc")
   at NASA ("nasa.gov").

   The primary NETFIND server is located at the University of Colorado
   in Boulder (bruno.cs.colorado.edu); alternate servers include:

      archie.au (AARNet, Melbourne, Australia)

   Archie is a tool for locating files on the Internet, originally
   developed at the Computer Science Department at McGill University in
   Montreal.  Archie allows users to find software, data, and other
   information files that reside at anonymous FTP archive sites across
   the Internet; the name of the program, reportedly, is derived from
   the word "archive" and not from the comic book character.  Archie
   tracks the contents of over 1,000 anonymous FTP archive sites
   containing over 2 million files.  The Archie server automatically
   updates the information from each registered site about once a month,
   providing relatively up-to-date information without unduly stressing
   the network.

   Before using Archie, you must identify a server address.  The sites
   below all support Archie; most (but not all) Archie sites support the
   "servers" command which lists all known Archie servers.  Due to the
   popularity of Archie and its high processing demands, many sites
   limit access to non-peak hours and/or limit the number of
   simultaneous Archie users.  Available Archie sites include:

      archie.au                   139.130.4.6     Australia
      archie.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at  140.78.3.8      Austria

   Archie servers may be accessed using TELNET.  When TELNETing to an
   Archie site, login as "archie" (you MUST use lower case); just hit
   &lt;ENTER&gt; if a password is requested.

   Once connected, the "help" command assists users in obtaining more
   information about using Archie.  Two more useful Archie commands are
   "prog", used to search for files in the database, and "whatis", which
   searches for keywords in the program descriptions.

   In the accompanying dialogue, the "set maxhits" command is used to
   limit the number of responses to any following "prog" commands; if
   this is not done, the user may get an enormous amount of information!

   In this example, the user issues a request to find entries related to
   "mpeg", ISO's Moving Pictures Experts Group video compression
   standard.  Armed with this information, a user can use anonymous FTP
   to examine these directories and files.

   The next request is for files with "security" as a keyword
   descriptor.  These responses can be used for subsequent "prog"
   commands.

   Exit archie using the "exit" command.  At this point, TELNET closes
   the connection and control returns to the local host.

   Additional information about Archie can be obtained by sending e-mail
   to Bunyip Information Systems (archie-info@bunyip.com).  Client
   software is not required to use Archie, but can make life a little
   easier; some such software can be downloaded using anonymous FTP from
   the "/pub/archie/" directory at host "ftp.cs.widener.edu" or in
   "/pub/archie/clients/" at "ftp.sura.net".  Most shareware and
   commercial Archie clients hide the complexity described in this
   section; users usually connect to a pre-configured Archie server
   merely by typing an "ARCHIE" command line.

   The Internet Gopher protocol was developed at the University of
   Minnesota's Microcomputer Center in 1991, as a distributed
   information search and retrieval tool for the Internet.  Gopher is
   described in <a href="rfc1436.html">RFC 1436</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"The Internet Gopher Protocol"'>1</a>]; the name derives from the University's
   mascot.

   Gopher provides a tool so that publicly available information at a
   host can be organized in a hierarchical fashion, allowing it to be
   perused using a simple menu system.  Gopher allows a user to view a
   file on demand without requiring additional file transfer protocols.
   Gopher also has the capability to "link" gophers on the Internet, so
   that each Gopher site can be used as a stepping stone to access other
   sites and reducing the amount of duplicate information and effort on
   the network.

   In many cases, users can access Gopher by TELNETing to a valid Gopher
   location; if the site provides a remote Gopher client, the user will
   see a text-based, menu interface.  The number of Gopher sites is
   growing rapidly; as the dialogue below shows, most Gopher sites have
   a menu item that will allow you to identify other Gopher sites.  If
   using TELNET, login with the username "gopher" (this MUST be in
   lowercase); no password is required.  Note that not all Gopher sites
   provide a remote Gopher client; users may need local Gopher client
   software on their system.

   The Gopher server at "ds.internic.net" has a tremendous amount of
   information for the new user, including lists of frequently asked
   questions and pointers to various Internet discussion lists.  In the
   sample dialogue below, the remote Gopher client is accessed by
   TELNETing to the host.  With the menu interface shown here, the user
   merely follows the prompts.  Initially, the main menu will appear;
   selecting item 2 causes Gopher to seize and display the "InterNIC
   Information Services" menu.  Move to the desired menu item by typing



<span class="grey">Kessler &amp; Shepard                                              [Page 27]</span></pre>

   the item number or by moving the "pointer" (--&gt;) down to the desired
   entry using the &lt;DOWN-ARROW&gt; key on the keyboard, and then hitting
   &lt;ENTER&gt;.  To quit the program at any time, press "q" (quit); "?" and
   "u" will provide help or go back up to the previous menu,
   respectively.  Users may also search for strings within files using
   the "/" command or download the file being interrogated using the "D"
   command.

   Menu item 7 (selected in the dialogue shown here) is titled
   "Beginners: Start Here", an excellent place for new users to obtain
   information about the Internet, available tools, terms and concepts,
   and, perhaps most importantly, some of the cultural aspects of the
   Internet community.

   Further information about Gopher can be obtained by contacting the
   Internet Gopher Team at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis
   (gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu).  This is also the site of the first
   Gopher server (consultant.micro.umn.edu).  A Gopher-related
   discussion list is maintained at gopher-news@boombox.micro.umn.edu
   (see <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> for information on subscribing to Internet
   discussion lists).  More information on Gopher clients can be found
   in the Gopher Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file, which can be
   downloaded using anonymous FTP in file
   "/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq" at the host "rtfm.mit.edu";
   this FAQ also lists sources for a number of Gopher clients for a wide
   range of hardware/software platforms.

   There are a number of other information servers that are growing in
   popularity and use.  The problem with being blessed with so much
   information from Archie, Gopher, and other sources is exactly that -
   too much information.  To make it easier for users to locate the
   system on which their desired information resides, a number of other
   tools have been created.

   Veronica (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized
   Archives) was developed at the University of Nevada in Reno as an
   adjunct to Gopher.  As the number of Gopher sites continues to grow,
   it has become increasingly harder to find information in
   "Gopherspace" since Gopher is designed to search a single database at
   a time.  Veronica maintains an index of titles of Gopher items and
   performs a keyword search on all of the Gopher sites that it has
   knowledge of and access to, obviating the need for the user to
   perform a menu-by-menu, site-by-site search for information.  When a
   user selects an item from the menu of a Veronica search, "sessions"
   are automatically established with the appropriate Gopher servers,
   and a list of data items is returned to the originating Gopher client
   in the form of a Gopher menu so that the user can access the files.

   Veronica is available as an option on many Gopher servers, including
   "internic.net".

   Another Gopher-adjunct is Jughead (Jonzy's Universal Gopher Hierarchy
   Excavation And Display).  Jughead supports key word searches and the
   use of logical operators (AND, OR, and NOT).  The result of a Jughead
   search is a display of all menu items which match the search string
   which are located in the University of Manchester and UMIST
   Information Server, working from a static database that is re-created
   every day.  Jughead is available from many Gopher sites (including
   "internic.net"), although Veronica may be a better tool for global
   searches.

   Archie and Gopher are primarily used for the indexing of text-based
   files.  The World Wide Web (WWW or W3) Project, initiated by the CERN
   Institute for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland, is designed to
   combine aspects of information retrieval with multimedia
   communications.  The WWW Project is intended to allow users to access
   information in many different types of formats, including text,
   sound, image, and video.  WWW treats all searchable Internet files as
   hypertext documents.  "Hypertext" is a new term which merely refers
   to text that contains pointers to other text, allowing a user reading
   one document to jump to another document for more information on a
   given topic, and then return to the same location in the original
   document.  The original WWW site is at CERN and may be accessed via



<span class="grey">Kessler &amp; Shepard                                              [Page 30]</span></pre>

   Telnet at "nxoc01.cern.ch".  The user will be automatically logged in
   and a help menu can be displayed by entering the "h" command.

   To generally access WWW servers, users must run client software
   called a "browser".  The browser reads documents from WWW servers and
   can access files by FTP, gopher, and other methods.  WWW can also
   handle hypermedia documents; "hypermedia" is another new term,
   referring to a file using any medium that contains pointers to
   another medium.  WWW browsers, then, are able to display images,
   sound, or animations in addition to text.  WWW sources and additional
   information may be accessed via anonymous FTP from the "/pub/WWW"
   directory at "info.cern.ch" or the "/Web" directory at
   "ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu".

   The most commonly used WWW browser is Mosaic, developed at the
   National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at the
   University of Illinois.  Mosaic provides a uniform mechanism for
   finding the location of information, as well as determining the data
   type, presentation method, and linkages to other information.  A
   large number of shareware Mosaic clients are available at
   "ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu".  It should be noted that commercial versions of
   Mosaic will also become available for a variety of platforms after
   the summer of 1994.

   The Wide Area Information Server (WAIS, pronounced "ways") was
   initiated jointly by Apple Computer, Dow Jones, KMPG Peat Marwick,
   and Thinking Machines Corp.  It is a set of free-ware, share-ware,
   and commercial software products for a wide variety of
   hardware/software platforms, which work together to help users find
   information on the Internet.  WAIS provides a single interface
   through which a user can access many different information databases.

   The user interface allow a query to be formulated in English and the
   WAIS server will automatically choose the appropriate databases to
   search.  Further information about WAIS can be obtained by reading
   the WAIS FAQ, from host "rtfm.mit.edu" in file
   "/pub/usenet/news.answers/wais-faq".

   As more and more protocols have become available to identify files,
   archive and server sites, news lists, and other information resources
   on the Internet, it was inevitable that some shorthand would arise to
   make it a little easier to designate these sources.  The common
   shorthand that is employed is called the Uniform Resource Locator
   (URL) format.





<span class="grey">Kessler &amp; Shepard                                              [Page 31]</span></pre>

   The list below provides information on how the URL format should be
   interpreted for the protocols and resources that have been discussed
   in this document.  A complete description of the URL format may be
   found in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Uniform Resource Locators (URL)"'>2</a>].

   file://"host"/"directory"/"file-name"
     Used to identify a specific file.  E.g., the file "htmlasst" in the
     "edu" directory at host "ftp.cs.da" would be denoted with URL as:
     &lt;URL:file://ftp.cs.da/edu/htmlasst&gt;

   ftp://"user":"password"@"host":"port"/"directory"/"file-name"
     Used to identify an FTP site.  E.g.:
     &lt;URL:ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Crypto/*&gt;

   gopher://"host":"port"/"gopher-path"
     Used to identify a Gopher site and menu path.  E.g.:
     &lt;URL:gopher://info.umd.edu:901/info/Government/Factbook92&gt;

   http://"host":"port"/"directory"/"file-name"?"searchpart"
     Used to identify a WWW server location.  "http" refers to the
     HyperText Transport Protocol; file names commonly use the ".html"
     extension, indicating use of the HyperText Markup Language.  E.g.:
     &lt;URL:http://info.isoc.org/home.html&gt;

   mailto:"e-mail address"
     Identifies an individual Internet mail address.  E.g.:
     &lt;URL:mailto:sds@hill.com&gt;

   telnet://"user":"password"@"host":"port"/
     Identifies a TELNET site (the trailing "/" is optional).  E.g.:
     &lt;URL:telnet//envnet:henniker@envnet.gsfc.nasa.gov&gt;

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20Discussion%20Lists"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>. Discussion Lists</span>

   Among the most useful features of the Internet are the discussion
   lists that have become available to allow individuals to discuss
   topics of mutual concern.  Discussion list topics range from SCUBA
   diving and home brewing of beer to AIDS research and foreign policy.
   Several, naturally, deal specifically with the Internet, TCP/IP
   protocols, and the impact of new technologies.

   Most of the discussion lists accessible from the Internet are
   "unmoderated", meaning that anyone can send a message to the list's
   central repository and the message will then be automatically
   forwarded to all subscribers of the list.  These lists provide very
   fast turn-around between submission of a message and delivery, but
   often result in a lot of messages (including inappropriate "junk
   mail").  A "moderated" list has an extra step; a human list moderator

   examines all messages before they are forwarded to ensure that the
   messages are appropriate to the list and not needlessly inflammatory!

   Users should be warned that some lists generate a significant amount
   of messages each day.  Before subscribing to too many lists, be sure
   that you are aware of local policies and/or charges governing access
   to discussion lists and e-mail storage.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20Internet%20Discussion%20Lists"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>. Internet Discussion Lists</span>

   A list of the known interest groups may be found by Gophering to
   "ds.internic.net".  Follow the menu path "InterNIC Information
   Services" | "Using the Internet" | "Basic Internet Services" |
   "Electronic Mail" | "Mailing Lists" to find the 8-part list of lists.

   Be careful if you download these files; the list is nearly 1.5 MB in
   size, listing over 800 lists!  Along the way, you will find a wealth
   of other information.

   Mail can be sent to an Internet list at an address with the following
   form:

        list_name@host_name

   The common convention when users want to subscribe, unsubscribe, or
   handle any other administrative matter is to send a message to the
   list administrator; do NOT send administrivia to the main list
   address!  The list administrator can usually be found at:

        list_name-REQUEST@host_name

   To subscribe to a list, it is often enough to place the word
   "subscribe" in the main body of the message, although a line with the
   format:

        SUBSCRIBE  list_name  your_full_name

   will satisfy most mail servers.  A similar message may be used to get
   off a list; just use the word "unsubscribe".

   Not every list follows this convention, but it is a safe bet if you
   don't have better information!

   Usenet, also known as NETNEWS or Usenet news, is another information
   source with its own set of special interest mailing lists organized
   into "newsgroups".  Usenet originated on UNIX systems but has



<span class="grey">Kessler &amp; Shepard                                              [Page 33]</span></pre>

   migrated to many other types of hosts, although most Usenet servers
   are still UNIX-based.  Usenet clients, called "newsreaders", are
   available for virtually any operating system.

   While Usenet newsgroups are usually accessible at Internet sites, a
   prospective Usenet client host must have appropriate newsreader
   software to be able to read news.  Users will have to check with
   their local host or network administrator to find out what Usenet
   newsgroups are locally available, as well as the local policies for
   using them.

   Usenet newsgroup names are hierarchical in nature.  The first part of
   the name, called the "hierarchy", provides an indication about the
   general subject area.  There are two types of hierarchies, called
   "mainstream" and "alternative"; the total number of newsgroups is in
   the thousands.  The "news.announce.newusers" newsgroup is a good
   place for new Usenet users to find a detailed introduction to the use
   of Usenet, as well as an introduction to its culture.

   Usenet mainstream hierarchies are established by a process that
   requires the approval of a majority of Usenet members.  Most sites
   that receive a NETNEWS feed receive all of these hierarchies, which
   include:

        comp      Computers
        misc      Miscellaneous
        news      Network news
        rec       Recreation
        sci       Science
        soc       Social issues
        talk      Various discussion lists

   The alternative hierarchies include lists that may be set up at any
   site that has the server software and disk space.  These lists are
   not formally part of Usenet and, therefore, may not be received by
   all sites getting NETNEWS.  The alternative hierarchies include:

        alt       Alternate miscellaneous discussion lists
        bionet    Biology, medicine, and life sciences
        bit       BITNET discussion lists

   discussion lists.  Some individuals join both lists in these
   circumstances or, often, there is cross-posting of messages.  Some
   Usenet newsgroup discussions are forwarded onto an Internet mailing
   list by an individual site to provide access to those users who do
   not have Usenet available.

   Users not connected to Usenet may post messages to a Usenet newsgroup
   using Internet e-mail.  First, replace the periods in the Usenet
   discussion list name with hyphens (e.g., the folk music discussion
   list, "rec.music.folk", would become "rec-music-folk").  Then, send
   an e-mail message to:

        newsgroup_name@CS.UTEXAS.EDU

   Usenet news may be read using Gopher.  Connect to the host
   "gopher.msu.edu" using the path "News &amp; Weather" | "USENET News" or
   host "gopher.bham.ac.uk" using the path "Usenet News Reader".

   Another important set of discussion groups is maintained using a
   program called LISTSERV.  LISTSERV is a service provided widely on
   BITNET and EARN (European Academic and Research Network), although it
   is also available to Internet users.

   LISTSERV commands are placed in the main body of e-mail messages sent
   to an appropriate list server location.  To find out what lists are
   available, send a message to "listserv@bitnic.educom.edu" with the
   command "list global" in the main body of the message; whatever you
   place in the "Subject:" field will be ignored.

   Once you have found a list of interest, you can send a message to the
   appropriate address with any appropriate command, including:

     HELP                                 Get help &amp; a list of commands
     SUBSCRIBE list_name your_full_name   Subscribe to a list
     UNSUBSCRIBE list_name                Unsubscribe from a list
     INDEX                                Get a list of LISTSERV files
     GET file_name                        Obtain a file from the server

   To fully appreciate and understand what is going on within the
   Internet community, users might wish to obtain the occasional
   Internet specification.  The main body of Internet documents are
   Request for Comments (RFCs), although a variety of RFC subsets have
   been defined for various specific purposes.  The sections below will
   describe the RFCs and other documentation, and how to get these
   documents.

   NOTE: For complete, up-to-date information on obtaining Internet
   documentation, users should Gopher to "ds.internic.net" and follow
   the path "InterNIC Information Services" | "About the Internet" |
   "Internet Documentation", and then select the desired set of
   documents.  This Gopher path is referred to as the "documentation
   root path" in the remainder of this section.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20Request%20for%20Comments%20%28RFCs%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>. Request for Comments (RFCs)</span>

   RFCs are the body of literature comprising Internet protocols,
   standards, research questions, hot topics, humor (especially those
   dated 1 April), and general information.  Each RFC is uniquely issued
   a number which is never reused or reissued; if a document is revised,
   it is given a new RFC number and the old RFC is said to be
   "obsoleted."  Announcements are sent to the RFC-DIST mailing list
   whenever a new RFC is issued; anyone may join this list by sending e-
   mail to "rfc-request@nic.ddn.mil".

   RFCs may be obtained through the mail (i.e., postal service), but it
   is easier and faster to get them on-line.  One easy way to obtain
   RFCs on-line is to use RFC-INFO, an e-mail-based service to help
   users locate and retrieve RFCs and other Internet documents.  To use
   the service, send e-mail to "rfc-info@isi.edu" and leave the
   "Subject:" field blank; commands that may go in the main body of the
   message include:

     HELP                       (Help file)
     HELP: ways_to_get_rfcs     (Help file on how to get RFCs)

     RETRIEVE: RFC
        Doc-ID: RFCxxxx         (Retrieve RFC xxxx; use all 4 digits)

     LIST: RFC                  (List all RFCs...)

       DATED-BEFORE: mmm-dd-yyyy
       OBSOLETES: RFCxxxx        (List RFCs obsoleting RFC xxxx)

   An alternative way to obtain RFCs by e-mail is to send an e-mail
   message to "service@nic.ddn.mil", leaving the "Subject:" field blank.

   In the main body of the message, use one or more of the following
   commands.  The RFC index, or a specific reference to an RFC, will
   indicate whether the RFC is available in ASCII text or PostScript
   format.  By convention, all RFCs are available in ASCII while some
   are also available in PostScript where use of graphics and/or
   different fonts adds more information or clarity.  The instructions
   below show how to get the index; be aware that this file is very
   large, containing the citing for over 1,700 documents.  Note that not
   all RFCs numbered below 698 (July 1975) are available on-line:

      SEND HELP                  (Help file)
      SEND RFC/RFC-INDEX         (RFC Index)
      SEND RFC/RFCxxxx.TXT       (ASCII version of RFC xxxx)
      SEND RFC/RFCxxxx.PS        (PostScript version of RFC xxxx)

   To obtain an RFC via anonymous FTP, connect to one of the RFC
   repositories listed in Table 1 using FTP.  After connecting, change
   to the appropriate RFC directory (as shown in Table 1) using the "cd"
   command.  To obtain a particular file, use the "get" command:

      GET RFC-INDEX.TXT local_name    (RFC Index)
      GET RFCxxxx.TXT   local_name    (ASCII version of RFC XXXX)
      GET RFCxxxx.PS    local_name    (PostScript version of RFC XXXX)

   RFCs describe many aspects of the Internet.  By the early 1990s,
   however, so many specifications of various protocols had been written
   that it was not always clear as to which documents represented
   standards for the Internet.  For that reason, a subset of RFCs have
   been designated as STDs to identify them as Internet standards.

   Unlike RFC numbers that are never reused, STD numbers always refer to
   the latest version of the standard.  UDP, for example, would be
   completely identified as "STD-6/RFC-768."  Note that STD numbers
   refer to a standard, which is not necessarily a single document; an
   STD, therefore, might refer to several RFCs.  STD 19, for example, is
   the NetBIOS Service Protocols standard and comprises RFCs 1001 and
   1002; a complete citation for this standard would be "STD-19/RFC-



<span class="grey">Kessler &amp; Shepard                                              [Page 38]</span></pre>

   1001/RFC-1002."

   The availability of new STDs is announced on the RFC-DIST mailing
   list.  STD-1 [<a href="#ref-14" title='"Internet Official Protocol Standards"'>14</a>] always refers to the latest list of "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards".  The Internet standards process is
   described in <a href="rfc1602.html">RFC 1602</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 2"'>6</a>] and STD notes are explained in <a href="rfc1311.html">RFC 1311</a>
   [<a href="#ref-15" title='"Introduction to the STD Notes"'>15</a>].

   STDs can be obtained as RFCs via anonymous FTP from any RFC
   repository.  In addition, some RFC sites (such as "nic.ddn.mil")
   provide an STD directory so that STD documents can be found in the
   path "/STD/xx.TXT", where "xx" refers to the STD number.

   STD documents may be obtained as RFCs using the methods described in
   <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.  STDs may also be obtained via the RFC-INFO server using
   the "RETRIEVE: STD" and "Doc-ID: STDxxxx" commands.  Also, check out
   the path "STD's (Standard RFC's)" under the documentation root path
   for the STD index, complete instructions on obtaining STDs, and a
   complete set of STDs.

   The For Your Information (FYI) series of RFCs provides Internet users
   with information about many topics related to the Internet.  FYI
   topics range from historical to explanatory to tutorial, and are
   aimed at the wide spectrum of people that use the Internet.  The FYI
   series includes answers to frequently asked questions by both
   beginning and seasoned users of the Internet, an annotated
   bibliography of Internet books, and an explanation of the domain name
   system.

   Like the STDs, an FYI number always refers to the latest version of
   an FYI.  FYI 4, for example, refers to the answers to commonly asked
   questions by new Internet users; its complete citation would be "FYI-
   4/RFC-1594."  The FYI notes are explained in FYI 1 [<a href="#ref-9" title='"F.Y.I. on F.Y.I.: Introduction to the F.Y.I. Notes"'>9</a>].

   FYIs can be obtained as RFCs via anonymous FTP from any RFC
   repository.  In addition, some RFC sites (such as "nic.ddn.mil")
   provide an FYI directory so that FYI documents can be found in the
   path "/FYI/xx.TXT", where "xx" refers to the FYI number.

   FYI documents may be obtained as RFCs using the methods described in
   <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.  FYIs may also be obtained via the RFC-INFO server using
   the "RETRIEVE: FYI" and "Doc-ID: FYIxxxx" commands.  Also, check out
   the path "FYI's (For Your Information RFC's)" under the documentation

   The Reseaux Associes pour la Recherche Europeenne (RARE) is the
   Association of European Research Networks and their users.  RARE's
   charter is to promote and participate in the creation of a high-
   quality European computer communications infrastructure for the
   support of research endeavors.  RARE member networks use Open Systems
   Interconnection (OSI) protocols and TCP/IP.  Since the summer of
   1993, to promote a closer relationship between RARE and the IETF,
   RARE Technical Reports (RTRs) are also published as RFCs.

   RTR documents may be obtained as RFCs using the methods described in
   <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.  RTRs may also be obtained via the RFC-INFO server using
   the "RETRIEVE: RTR" and "Doc-ID: RTRxxxx" commands.  Also, check out

   This guide is intended to provide the reader with a rudimentary
   ability to use the utilities that are provided by TCP/IP and the
   Internet.  By now, it is clear that the user's knowledge, ability,
   and willingness to experiment are about the only limits to what can
   be accomplished.

   The next step is to explore the nooks and crannies of the network.
   One software tool that will users in this quest is the Merit Computer
   Center's (Ann Arbor, MI) "Cruise of the Internet", available at no
   cost from the host "nic.merit.edu" using FTP.  For more information,
   read the "readme" files in the directories "internet/resources/

   versions, respectively.  For general information about resources at
   this site, see the READ.ME file in the root directory or send e-mail

   Finally, Carl Malamud has written a delightful book called "Exploring
   the Internet: A Technical Travelogue" [<a href="#ref-32" title='"Exploring the Internet: A Technical Travelogue"'>32</a>], chronicling not the
   Internet as much as the people who built it and use it.  This book
   will not teach you how to perform an anonymous FTP file transfer nor
   how to use Gopher, but provides insights about our network (and
   Carl's gastro-pathology) that no mere statistics can convey.
