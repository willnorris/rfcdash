Abstract

   This document lists a set of functional requirements that served as
   input to the design of Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) extensions
   for setting up point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSP),
   in order to deliver point-to-multipoint applications over a
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) infrastructure.

   This work was overtaken by the protocol solution developed by the
   MPLS working group, but that solution did not closely follow the
   requirements documented here.  This document is published as a
   historic record of the ideas and requirements that shaped the
   protocol work.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document lists a set of functional requirements that served as
   input to the design of Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) extensions
   for setting up point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSP)
   [<a href="#ref-MLDP" title='"Label Distribution Protocol Extensions for Point-to- Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>MLDP</a>], in order to deliver point-to-multipoint applications over a
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) infrastructure.

   This work was overtaken by the protocol solution developed by the
   MPLS working group and documented in [<a href="#ref-MLDP" title='"Label Distribution Protocol Extensions for Point-to- Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths"'>MLDP</a>].  That solution did not
   closely follow the requirements documented here, and it was
   recognized that this document had served its purpose in driving
   discussions of how the solution should be designed.  At this point,
   no further action is planned to update this document in line with the
   protocol solution, and this document is published simply as a
   historic record of the ideas and requirements that shaped the
   protocol work.

   The document is structured as follows:

   o  <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> is an overview of the requirements.

   o  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> illustrates an application scenario.

   o  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> addresses detailed requirements for P2MP LSPs.

   o  <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> discusses requirements for shared trees and multipoint-
      to-multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs.

   o  <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> presents criteria against which a solution can be
      evaluated.

   LDP [<a href="rfc5036.html" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC5036</a>] has been deployed for setting up point-to-point (P2P)
   and multipoint-to-point (MP2P) LSPs, in order to offer point-to-point
   services in MPLS backbones.

   There are emerging requirements for supporting delivery of point-to-
   multipoint applications in MPLS backbones, such as those defined in
   [<a href="rfc4834.html" title='"Requirements for Multicast in Layer 3 Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs)"'>RFC4834</a>] and [<a href="rfc5501.html" title='"Requirements for Multicast Support in Virtual Private LAN Services"'>RFC5501</a>].

   For various reasons, including consistency with P2P applications, and
   taking full advantages of MPLS network infrastructure, it would be
   highly desirable to use MPLS LSPs for the delivery of multicast
   traffic.  This could be implemented by setting up a group of P2P or
   MP2P LSPs, but such an approach may be inefficient since it would
   result in data replication at the Ingress LSR and duplicate data
   traffic within the network.

   Hence, new mechanisms are required that would allow traffic from an
   Ingress LSR to be efficiently delivered to a number of Egress LSRs in
   an MPLS backbone on a point-to-multipoint LSP (P2MP LSP), avoiding
   duplicate copies of a packet on a given link and relying on MPLS
   traffic replication at some Branch LSRs.

   Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
   extensions for setting up point-to-multipoint Traffic Engineered LSPs
   (P2MP TE LSPs) have been defined in [<a href="rfc4875.html" title='"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Point-to-Multipoint TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4875</a>].  They meet
   requirements expressed in [<a href="rfc4461.html" title='"Signaling Requirements for Point-to- Multipoint Traffic-Engineered MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4461</a>].  This approach is useful in
   network environments where P2MP Traffic Engineering capabilities are
   needed (optimization, QoS, fast recovery).

   However, for operators who want to support point-to-multipoint
   traffic delivery on an MPLS backbone, without Traffic Engineering
   needs, and who have already deployed LDP for P2P traffic, an
   interesting and useful approach would be to rely on LDP extensions in
   order to set up point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.  This would bring

   consistency with P2P MPLS applications and would ease the delivery of
   point-to-multipoint services in an MPLS backbone.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.4.%20%20Document%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4" name="section-1.4">1.4</a>.  Document Scope</span>

   This document focuses on the LDP approach for setting up P2MP LSPs.
   It lists a detailed set of requirements for P2MP extensions to LDP,
   so as to deliver P2MP traffic over an LDP-enabled MPLS
   infrastructure.  The original intent was that these requirements
   should be used as guidelines when specifying LDP extensions.

   Note that generic requirements for P2MP extensions to MPLS are out of
   the scope of this document.  Rather, this document describes
   solution-specific requirements related to LDP extensions in order to
   set up P2MP LSPs.

   Note also that other mechanisms could be used for setting up P2MP
   LSPs (for instance, PIM extensions), but these are out of the scope
   of this document.  The objective is not to compare these mechanisms
   but rather to focus on the requirements for an LDP extension
   approach.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Requirements%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Requirements Overview</span>

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support setting up P2MP LSPs, i.e., LSPs
   with one Ingress LSR and one or more Egress LSRs, with traffic
   replication at some Branch LSRs.

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST allow the addition or removal of leaves
   associated with a P2MP LSP.

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST coexist with current LDP mechanisms and
   inherit its capability sets from [<a href="rfc5036.html" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC5036</a>].  It is of paramount
   importance that the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST NOT impede the operation
   of existing P2P/MP2P LDP LSPs.  Also, the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST
   coexist with P2P and P2MP RSVP-TE mechanisms [<a href="rfc3209.html" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels"'>RFC3209</a>] [<a href="rfc4875.html" title='"Extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for Point-to-Multipoint TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4875</a>].  It
   is of paramount importance that the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST NOT
   impede the operation of existing P2P and P2MP RSVP-TE LSPs.

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MAY also allow setting up multipoint-to-
   multipoint (MP2MP) LSPs connecting a group of Leaf LSRs acting
   indifferently as Ingress LSR or Egress LSR.  This may allow a
   reduction in the amount of LDP state that needs to be maintained by
   an LSR.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Application%20Scenario"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Application Scenario</span>

   Figure 1 below illustrates an LDP-enabled MPLS provider network, used
   to carry both unicast and multicast traffic of VPN customers
   following, for instance, the architecture defined in [<a href="#ref-MVPN" title='"Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>MVPN</a>] for BGP/
   MPLS VPNs or the one defined in [<a href="#ref-VPLS-MCAST" title='"Multicast in VPLS"'>VPLS-MCAST</a>].

   In this example, a set of MP2P LDP LSPs is set up between Provider
   Edge (PE) routers to carry unicast VPN traffic within the MPLS
   backbone (not represented in Figure 1).

   In this example, a set of P2MP LDP LSPs is set up between PE routers
   acting as Ingress LSRs and PE routers acting as Egress LSRs, so as to
   support multicast VPN traffic delivery within the MPLS backbone.

   For instance, a P2MP LDP LSP is set up between Ingress LSR PE1 and
   Egress LSRs PE2, PE3, and PE4.  It is used to transport multicast
   traffic from PE1 to PE2, PE3, and PE4.  P1 is a Branch LSR; it
   replicates MPLS traffic sent by PE1 to P2, P3, and PE2.  P2 and P3
   are non-Branch Transit LSRs; they forward MPLS traffic sent by P1 to
   PE3 and PE4, respectively.

   If later there are new receivers attached to PE5 and PE6, then PE5
   and PE6 join the P2MP LDP LSP.  P2 and P3 become Branch LSRs and
   replicate traffic received from P1 to PE3 and PE5 and to PE4 and PE6,
   respectively (see Figure 2 below).

   The above example is provided for the sake of illustration.  Note
   that P2MP LSPs Ingress and Egress LSRs may not necessarily be PE
   routers.  Also, Branch LSRs may not necessarily be P routers.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20P2MP%20LSPs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  P2MP LSPs</span>

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support setting up P2MP LSPs.  Data plane
   aspects related to P2MP LSPs are those already defined in [<a href="rfc4461.html" title='"Signaling Requirements for Point-to- Multipoint Traffic-Engineered MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)"'>RFC4461</a>].
   That is, a P2MP LSP has one Ingress LSR and one or more Egress LSRs.
   Traffic sent by the Ingress LSR is received by all Egress LSRs.  The
   specific aspect related to P2MP LSPs is the action required at a
   Branch LSR, where data replication occurs.  Incoming labeled data is
   appropriately replicated to several outgoing interfaces, which may
   use different labels.

   An LSR SHOULD NOT send more than one copy of a packet on any given
   link of a P2MP LSP.  Exceptions to this are mentioned in Sections <a href="#section-4.9">4.9</a>
   and 4.18.

   A P2MP LSP MUST be identified by a constant and unique identifier
   within the whole LDP domain, whatever the number of leaves, which may
   vary dynamically.  This identifier will be used so as to add/remove
   leaves to/from the P2MP tree.

   As with P2P MPLS technology [<a href="rfc5036.html" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC5036</a>], traffic MUST be classified
   into a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) in this P2MP extension.
   All packets that belong to a particular P2MP FEC and that travel from
   a particular node MUST use the same P2MP LSP.

   If existing FECs cannot be used for this purpose, a new LDP FEC that
   is suitable for P2MP forwarding MUST be specified.

   As with P2P and MP2P LDP LSPs, the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support
   hop-by-hop LSP routing.  P2MP LDP-based routing SHOULD rely upon the
   information maintained in LSR Routing Information Bases (RIBs).

   It is RECOMMENDED that the P2MP LSP routing rely upon the unicast
   route to the Ingress LSR to build a reverse path tree.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20Setting%20Up%2C%20Tearing%20Down%2C%20and%20Modifying%20P2MP%20LSPs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Setting Up, Tearing Down, and Modifying P2MP LSPs</span>

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support the establishment, maintenance,
   and teardown of P2MP LSPs in a scalable manner.  This MUST include
   both the existence of a large number of P2MP LSPs within a single
   network and a large number of Leaf LSRs for a single P2MP LSP (see
   also <a href="#section-4.17">Section 4.17</a> for scalability considerations and figures).

   In order to scale well with a large number of leaves, it is
   RECOMMENDED to follow a leaf-initiated P2MP LSP setup approach.  For
   that purpose, leaves will have to be aware of the P2MP LSP
   identifier.  The ways a Leaf LSR discovers P2MP LSP identifiers rely
   on the applications that will use P2MP LSPs and are out of the scope
   of this document.

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST allow the dynamic addition and removal of
   leaves to and from a P2MP LSP, without any restriction (provided
   there is network connectivity).  It is RECOMMENDED that these
   operations be leaf-initiated.  These operations MUST NOT impact the
   data transfer (packet loss, duplication, delay) towards other leaves.
   It is RECOMMENDED that these operations do not cause any additional
   processing except on the path from the added/removed Leaf LSR to the
   Branch LSR.

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support downstream unsolicited label
   advertisement mode.  This is well suited to a leaf-initiated approach
   and is consistent with P2P/MP2P LDP operations.

   Data duplication refers to the receipt of multiple copies of a packet
   by any leaf.  Although this may be a marginal situation, it may also
   be detrimental for certain applications.  Hence, data duplication
   SHOULD be avoided as much as possible and limited to (hopefully rare)
   transitory conditions.

   Note, in particular, that data duplication might occur if P2MP LSP
   rerouting is being performed (see also <a href="#section-4.8">Section 4.8</a>).

   The P2MP LDP extension MUST have a mechanism to detect routing loops.
   This MAY rely on extensions to the LDP loop detection mechanism
   defined in [<a href="rfc5036.html" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC5036</a>].  A loop detection mechanism MAY require
   recording the set of LSRs traversed on the P2MP tree.  The P2MP loop
   avoidance mechanism MUST NOT impact the scalability of the P2MP LDP
   solution.

   The P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD have a mechanism to avoid routing loops
   in the data plane even during transient events.

   Furthermore, the P2MP LDP mechanism MUST avoid routing loops in the
   data plane, which may trigger unexpected non-localized exponential
   growth of traffic.

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support the rerouting of a P2MP LSP in
   the following cases:

   o  Network failure (link or node);

   o  A better path exists (e.g., new link or metric change); and

   o  Planned maintenance.

   Given that P2MP LDP routing should rely on the RIB, the achievement
   of the following requirements relies on the underlying routing
   protocols (IGP, etc.).

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST allow for rerouting of a P2MP LSP in case
   of link or node failure(s) by relying upon update of the routes in
   the RIB.  The rerouting time SHOULD be minimized as much as possible
   so as to reduce traffic disruption.

   A mechanism MUST be defined to prevent constant P2MP LSP teardown and
   rebuild, which may be caused by the instability of a specific link/
   node in the network.  This can rely on IGP dampening but may be
   completed by specific dampening at the LDP level.

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST allow for rerouting of a P2MP LSP in case

   a metric change, a link repair, or the addition of links or nodes.
   This will rely on update of the routes in the RIB.

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support planned maintenance operations.
   It MUST be possible to reroute a P2MP LSP before a link/node is
   deactivated for maintenance purposes.  Traffic disruption and data
   duplication SHOULD be minimized as much as possible during such
   planned maintenance.  P2MP LSP rerouting upon planned maintenance MAY

   The P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD provide a way for a Branch LSR to send

   (e.g., an Ethernet LAN) and reach multiple adjacent downstream nodes.
   This requires that the same label be negotiated with all downstream
   LSRs for the LSP.

   When there are several candidate upstream LSRs on an interface to a
   multi-access LAN, the P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD provide a way for all
   downstream LSRs of a given P2MP LSP to select the same upstream LSR,
   so as to avoid traffic replication.  In addition, the P2MP LDP
   mechanism SHOULD allow for an efficient balancing of a set of P2MP
   LSPs among a set of candidate upstream LSRs on a LAN interface.

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST provide a way for a Branch LSR of a P2MP
   LSP, which is also a Head End LSR of a P2MP TE tunnel, to send a
   single copy of the data onto the tunnel and reach all downstream LSRs

   Labels for P2MP LSPs and P2P/MP2P LSPs MAY be assigned from shared or

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST support the establishment of multi-area

   area as the Ingress LSR.  This SHOULD be possible without requiring
   the advertisement of Ingress LSRs' addresses across IGP areas.

   The P2MP LDP mechanism MUST also support the establishment of
   inter-AS P2MP LSPs, i.e., LSPs whose leaves do not all reside in the
   same AS as the Ingress LSR.  This SHOULD be possible without
   requiring the advertisement of Ingress LSRs' addresses across ASes.

   A solution MUST be designed to re-establish connectivity for P2MP and

   connectivity between ingress and egress nodes (i.e., designed without

   Scalability is a key requirement for the P2MP LDP mechanism.  It MUST
   be designed to scale well with an increase in the number of any of
   the following:

   o  Number of Leaf LSRs per P2MP LSP;

   o  Number of downstream LSRs per Branch LSR; and

   o  Number of P2MP LSPs per LSR.

   In order to scale well with an increase in the number of leaves, it
   is RECOMMENDED that the size of a P2MP LSP state on an LSR, for one
   particular LSP, depend only on the number of adjacent LSRs on the
   LSP.

   Typical orders of magnitude that we expect should be supported are:

   o  Tens of thousands of P2MP trees spread out across core network
      routers; and

   o  Hundreds, or a few thousands, of leaves per tree.

   In order to allow for a smooth migration, the P2MP LDP mechanism
   SHOULD offer as much backward compatibility as possible.  In
   particular, the solution SHOULD allow the setup of a P2MP LSP along
   non-Branch Transit LSRs that do not support P2MP LDP extensions.

   Also, the P2MP LDP solution MUST coexist with current LDP mechanisms
   and inherit its capability sets from [<a href="rfc5036.html" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC5036</a>].  The P2MP LDP
   solution MUST NOT impede the operation of P2P/MP2P LSPs.  A P2MP LDP
   solution MUST be designed in such a way that it allows P2P/MP2P and
   P2MP LSPs to be signaled on the same interface.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Shared%20Trees"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Shared Trees</span>

   For traffic delivery between a group of N LSRs that act as egress
   and/or egress nodes on different P2MP flows, it may be useful to set
   up a shared tree connecting all these LSRs instead of having N P2MP
   LSPs.  This would reduce the amount of control and forwarding state
   that has to be maintained on a given LSR.

   There are two main options for supporting such shared trees:

   o  Relying on the applications' protocols that use LDP LSPs.  A
      shared tree could consist of the combination of an MP2P LDP LSP
      from Leaf LSRs to a given root node with a P2MP LSP from this root
      to Leaf LSRs.  For instance, with Multicast L3 VPN applications,
      it would be possible to build a shared tree by combining (see
      [<a href="#ref-MVPN" title='"Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs"'>MVPN</a>]):

      *  An MP2P unicast LDP LSP, from each PE router of the group to a
         particular root PE router acting as tree root and

      *  A P2MP LDP LSP from this root PE router to each PE router of
         the group.

   o  Relying on a specific LDP mechanism allowing the setup of
      multipoint-to-multipoint MPLS LSPs (MP2MP LSPs).

   The former approach (combination of MP2P and P2MP LSPs at the
   application level) is out of the scope of this document while the
   latter (MP2MP LSPs) is within the scope of this document.
   Requirements for the setup of MP2MP LSPs are listed below.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20Requirements%20for%20MP2MP%20LSPs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Requirements for MP2MP LSPs</span>

   A multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) LSP is an LSP connecting a group
   of Leaf LSRs acting as Egress and/or Ingress LSRs.  Traffic sent by
   any Leaf LSR is received by all other Leaf LSRs of the group.

   Procedures for setting up MP2MP LSPs with LDP SHOULD be specified.
   An implementation that supports P2MP LDP LSPs MAY also support MP2MP
   LDP LSPs.

   The MP2MP LDP procedures MUST NOT impede the operations of P2MP LSP.

   Requirements for P2MP LSPs, set forth in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>, apply equally to
   MP2MP LSPs.  Particular attention should be given to the requirements
   below:

   o  The solution MUST support recovery upon link and transit node
      failure and be designed to re-establish connectivity for MP2MP
      LSPs in the event of failures, provided network connectivity
      exists between ingress and egress nodes (i.e., designed without
      introducing single points of failure).

   o  The size of MP2MP state on an LSR, for one particular MP2MP LSP,
      SHOULD only depend on the number of adjacent LSRs on the LSP.

   o  Furthermore, the MP2MP LDP mechanism MUST avoid routing loops that
      may trigger exponential growth of traffic.  Note that this
      requirement is more challenging with MP2MP LSPs as an LSR may need
      to receive traffic for a given LSP on multiple interfaces.

   There are additional requirements specific to MP2MP LSPs:

   o  It is RECOMMENDED that an MP2MP MPLS LSP is built based on the
      unicast route to a specific LSR called root LSR.

   o  It is RECOMMENDED to define several root LSRs (e.g., a primary and
      a backup) to ensure redundancy upon root LSR failure.

   o  The receiver SHOULD NOT receive back a packet it has sent on the
      MP2MP LSP.

   o  The solution SHOULD avoid that all traffic between any pair of
      leaves is traversing a root LSR (similarly to PIM-Bidir trees) and
      SHOULD provide the operator with means to minimize the delay
      between two leaves.

   o  It MUST be possible to check connectivity of an MP2MP LSP in both
      directions.

   criteria:

   (1)  Efficiency of network resource usage;

   (2)  Time to add or remove a Leaf LSR;

   (3)  Time to repair a P2MP LSP in case of link or node failure; and

   (4)  Scalability (state size, number of messages, message size).

   Particularly, the P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD be designed with the key
   objective of minimizing the additional amount of state and additional
   processing required in the network.

   Also, the P2MP LDP mechanism SHOULD be designed so that convergence
   times in case of link or node failure are minimized, in order to
   limit traffic disruption.
