    <span class="h1">TCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) RTO Restart</span>

Abstract

   This document describes a modified sender-side algorithm for managing
   the TCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
   retransmission timers that provides faster loss recovery when there
   is a small amount of outstanding data for a connection.  The
   modification, RTO Restart (RTOR), allows the transport to restart its
   retransmission timer using a smaller timeout duration, so that the
   effective retransmission timeout (RTO) becomes more aggressive in
   situations where fast retransmit cannot be used.  This enables faster
   loss detection and recovery for connections that are short lived or
   application limited.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   TCP and SCTP use two almost identical mechanisms to detect and
   recover from data loss, specified in [<a href="rfc6298.html" title="&quot;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer&quot;">RFC6298</a>] and [<a href="rfc5681.html" title='"TCP Congestion Control"'>RFC5681</a>] for TCP
   and [<a href="rfc4960.html" title='"Stream Control Transmission Protocol"'>RFC4960</a>] for SCTP.  First, if transmitted data is not
   acknowledged within a certain amount of time, a retransmission
   timeout (RTO) occurs and the data is retransmitted.  While the RTO is
   based on measured round-trip times (RTTs) between the sender and
   receiver, it also has a conservative lower bound of 1 second to
   ensure that delayed data are not mistaken as lost.  Second, when a
   sender receives duplicate acknowledgments or similar information via
   selective acknowledgments, the fast retransmit algorithm suspects
   data loss and can trigger a retransmission.  Duplicate (and
   selective) acknowledgments are generated by a receiver when data
   arrives out of order.  As both data loss and data reordering cause
   out-of-order arrival, fast retransmit waits for three out-of-order
   notifications before considering the corresponding data as lost.  In
   some situations, however, the amount of outstanding data is not
   enough to trigger three such acknowledgments, and the sender must
   rely on lengthy RTOs for loss recovery.

   The amount of outstanding data can be small for several reasons:

   (1)  The connection is limited by congestion control when the path
        has a low total capacity (bandwidth-delay product) or the
        connection's share of the capacity is small.  It is also limited
        by congestion control in the first few RTTs of a connection or
        after an RTO when the available capacity is probed using
        slow-start.

   (2)  The connection is limited by the receiver's available buffer
        space.

   (3)  The connection is limited by the application if the available
        capacity of the path is not fully utilized (e.g., interactive
        applications) or is at the end of a transfer.

   While the reasons listed above are valid for any flow, the third
   reason is most common for applications that transmit short flows or
   use a bursty transmission pattern.  A typical example of applications
   that produce short flows are web-based applications.  [<a href="#ref-RJ10" title='"Web metrics: Size and number of resources"'>RJ10</a>] shows
   that 70% of all web objects, found at the top 500 sites, are too
   small for fast retransmit to work.  [<a href="#ref-FDT13" title='"Reducing Web Latency: the Virtue of Gentle Aggression"'>FDT13</a>] shows that about 77% of
   all retransmissions sent by a major web service are sent after RTO
   expiry.  Applications with bursty transmission patterns often send
   data in response to actions or as a reaction to real life events.
   Typical examples of such applications are stock-trading systems,
   remote computer operations, online games, and web-based applications

   applications is that they are often time dependent, and extra latency
   can reduce the application service level [<a href="#ref-P09" title='"Improving latency for interactive, thin- stream applications over reliable transport"'>P09</a>].

   The RTO Restart (RTOR) mechanism described in this document makes the
   effective RTO slightly more aggressive when the amount of outstanding
   data is too small for fast retransmit to work, in an attempt to
   enable faster loss recovery while being robust to reordering.  While
   RTOR still conforms to the requirement for when a segment can be
   retransmitted, specified in [<a href="rfc6298.html" title="&quot;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer&quot;">RFC6298</a>] for TCP and [<a href="rfc4960.html" title='"Stream Control Transmission Protocol"'>RFC4960</a>] for SCTP,
   it could increase the risk of spurious timeouts.  To determine
   whether this modification is safe to deploy and enable by default,
   further experimentation is required.  <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> discusses experiments
   still needed, including evaluations in environments where the risk of
   spurious retransmissions are increased, e.g., mobile networks with
   highly varying RTTs.

   The remainder of this document describes RTOR and its implementation
   for TCP only, to make the document easier to read.  However, the RTOR
   algorithm described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> is applicable also for SCTP.
   Furthermore, <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> details the SCTP socket API needed to control
   RTOR.

      yet sent.

   o  RTO Restart threshold (rrthresh): RTOR is enabled whenever the sum

   The RTO management algorithm described in [<a href="rfc6298.html" title="&quot;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer&quot;">RFC6298</a>] recommends that
   the retransmission timer be restarted when an acknowledgment (ACK)
   that acknowledges new data is received and there is still outstanding
   data.  The restart is conducted to guarantee that unacknowledged
   segments will be retransmitted after approximately RTO seconds.  The
   standardized RTO timer management is illustrated in Figure 1, where a
   TCP sender transmits three segments to a receiver.  The arrival of

   the first and second segment triggers a delayed ACK (delACK)
   [<a href="rfc1122.html" title='"Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers"'>RFC1122</a>], which restarts the RTO timer at the sender.  The RTO is
   restarted approximately one RTT after the transmission of the third
   segment.  Thus, if the third segment is lost, as indicated in
   Figure 1, the effective loss detection time becomes "RTO + RTT"
   seconds.  In some situations, the effective loss detection time
   becomes even longer.  Consider a scenario where only two segments are
   outstanding.  If the second segment is lost, the time to expire the
   delACK timer will also be included in the effective loss detection
   time.

   For bulk traffic, the current approach is beneficial -- it is
   described in [<a href="#ref-EL04" title='"The Peak-Hopper: A New End- to-End Retransmission Timer for Reliable Unicast Transport"'>EL04</a>] to act as a "safety margin" that compensates for
   some of the problems that the authors have identified with the
   standard RTO calculation.  Notably, the authors of [<a href="#ref-EL04" title='"The Peak-Hopper: A New End- to-End Retransmission Timer for Reliable Unicast Transport"'>EL04</a>] also state
   that "this safety margin does not exist for highly interactive
   applications where often only a single packet is in flight."  In
   general, however, as long as enough segments arrive at a receiver to
   enable fast retransmit, RTO-based loss recovery should be avoided.
   RTOs should only be used as a last resort, as they drastically lower
   the congestion window as compared to fast retransmit.

   Although fast retransmit is preferable, there are situations where
   timeouts are appropriate or are the only choice.  For example, if the
   network is severely congested and no segments arrive, RTO-based
   recovery should be used.  In this situation, the time to recover from
   the loss(es) will not be the performance bottleneck.  However, for
   connections that do not utilize enough capacity to enable fast
   retransmit, RTO-based loss detection is the only choice, and the time
   required for this can become a performance bottleneck.

   To enable faster loss recovery for connections that are unable to use
   fast retransmit, RTOR can be used.  This section specifies the
   modifications required to use RTOR.  By resetting the timer to "RTO -
   T_earliest", where T_earliest is the time elapsed since the earliest
   outstanding segment was transmitted, retransmissions will always
   occur after exactly RTO seconds.

   This document specifies an OPTIONAL sender-only modification to TCP
   and SCTP, which updates step 5.3 in <a href="rfc6298.html#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC6298]</a> (and a
   similar update in <a href="rfc4960.html#section-6.3.2">Section 6.3.2 of [RFC4960]</a> for SCTP).  A sender
   that implements this method MUST follow the algorithm below:

      When an ACK is received that acknowledges new data:

      (1)  Set T_earliest = 0.

      (2)  If the sum of the number of outstanding and previously unsent
           segments (prevunsnt) is less than an RTOR threshold
           (rrthresh), set T_earliest to the time elapsed since the
           earliest outstanding segment was sent.

      (3)  Restart the retransmission timer so that it will expire after
           (for the current value of RTO):

           (a)  RTO - T_earliest, if RTO - T_earliest &gt; 0.

           (b)  RTO, otherwise.

   The RECOMMENDED value of rrthresh is four, as this value will ensure
   that RTOR is only used when fast retransmit cannot be triggered.
   With this update, TCP implementations MUST track the time elapsed
   since the transmission of the earliest outstanding segment
   (T_earliest).  As RTOR is only used when the amount of outstanding
   and previously unsent data is less than rrthresh segments, TCP
   implementations also need to track whether the amount of outstanding
   and previously unsent data is more, equal, or less than rrthresh
   segments.  Although some packet-based TCP implementations (e.g.,
   Linux TCP) already track both the transmission times of all segments
   and also the number of outstanding segments, not all implementations
   do.  <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a> describes how to implement segment tracking for a
   general TCP implementation.  To use RTOR, the calculated expiration
   time MUST be positive (step 3(a) in the list above); this is required
   to ensure that RTOR does not trigger retransmissions prematurely when
   previously retransmitted segments are acknowledged.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Discussion"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Discussion</span>

   Although RTOR conforms to the requirement in [<a href="rfc6298.html" title="&quot;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer&quot;">RFC6298</a>] that segments
   must not be retransmitted earlier than RTO seconds after their
   original transmission, RTOR makes the effective RTO more aggressive.
   In this section, we discuss the applicability and the issues related
   to RTOR.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Applicability</span>

   The currently standardized algorithm has been shown to add at least
   one RTT to the loss recovery process in TCP [<a href="#ref-LS00" title='"The Eifel retransmission timer"'>LS00</a>] and SCTP [<a href="#ref-HB11" title='"SCTP: designed for timely message delivery?"'>HB11</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-PBP09" title='"Improving SCTP retransmission delays for time-dependent thin streams"'>PBP09</a>].  For applications that have strict timing requirements
   (e.g., interactive web) rather than throughput requirements, using
   RTOR could be beneficial because the RTT and the delACK timer of
   receivers are often large components of the effective loss recovery
   time.  Measurements in [<a href="#ref-HB11" title='"SCTP: designed for timely message delivery?"'>HB11</a>] have shown that the total transfer time
   of a lost segment (including the original transmission time and the
   loss recovery time) can be reduced by 35% using RTOR.  These results
   match those presented in [<a href="#ref-PGH06" title='"Considerations of SCTP Retransmission Delays for Thin Streams"'>PGH06</a>] and [<a href="#ref-PBP09" title='"Improving SCTP retransmission delays for time-dependent thin streams"'>PBP09</a>], where RTOR is shown to
   significantly reduce retransmission latency.

   There are also traffic types that do not benefit from RTOR.  One
   example of such traffic is bulk transmission.  The reason why bulk
   traffic does not benefit from RTOR is that such traffic flows mostly
   have four or more segments outstanding, allowing loss recovery by
   fast retransmit.  However, there is no harm in using RTOR for such
   traffic as the algorithm is only active when the amount of
   outstanding and unsent segments are less than rrthresh (default 4).

   Given that RTOR is a mostly conservative algorithm, it is suitable
   for experimentation as a system-wide default for TCP traffic.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Spurious%20Timeouts"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Spurious Timeouts</span>

   RTOR can in some situations reduce the loss detection time and
   thereby increase the risk of spurious timeouts.  In theory, the
   retransmission timer has a lower bound of 1 second [<a href="rfc6298.html" title="&quot;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer&quot;">RFC6298</a>], which
   limits the risk of having spurious timeouts.  However, in practice,
   most implementations use a significantly lower value.  Initial
   measurements show slight increases in the number of spurious timeouts
   when such lower values are used [<a href="#ref-RHB15" title='"An Evaluation of Tail Loss Recovery Mechanisms for TCP"'>RHB15</a>].  However, further
   experiments, in different environments and with different types of
   traffic, are encouraged to quantify such increases more reliably.

   Does a slightly increased risk matter?  Generally, spurious timeouts
   have a negative effect on the network as segments are transmitted
   needlessly.  However, recent experiments do not show a significant

   increase in network load for a number of realistic scenarios [<a href="#ref-RHB15" title='"An Evaluation of Tail Loss Recovery Mechanisms for TCP"'>RHB15</a>].
   Another problem with spurious retransmissions is related to the
   performance of TCP/SCTP, as the congestion window is reduced to one
   segment when timeouts occur [<a href="rfc5681.html" title='"TCP Congestion Control"'>RFC5681</a>].  This could be a potential
   problem for applications transmitting multiple bursts of data within
   a single flow, e.g., web-based HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.0 applications.
   However, results from recent experiments involving persistent web
   traffic [<a href="#ref-RHB15" title='"An Evaluation of Tail Loss Recovery Mechanisms for TCP"'>RHB15</a>] revealed a net gain using RTOR.  Other types of
   flows, e.g., long-lived bulk flows, are not affected as the algorithm
   is only applied when the amount of outstanding and unsent segments is
   less than rrthresh.  Furthermore, short-lived and application-limited
   flows are typically not affected as they are too short to experience
   the effect of congestion control or have a transmission rate that is
   quickly attainable.

   While a slight increase in spurious timeouts has been observed using
   RTOR, it is not clear whether or not the effects of this increase
   mandate any future algorithmic changes -- especially since most
   modern operating systems already include mechanisms to detect
   [<a href="rfc3522.html" title='"The Eifel Detection Algorithm for TCP"'>RFC3522</a>] [<a href="rfc3708.html" title='"Using TCP Duplicate Selective Acknowledgement (DSACKs) and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Duplicate Transmission Sequence Numbers (TSNs) to Detect Spurious Retransmissions"'>RFC3708</a>] [<a href="rfc5682.html" title='"Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO): An Algorithm for Detecting Spurious Retransmission Timeouts with TCP"'>RFC5682</a>] and resolve [<a href="rfc4015.html" title='"The Eifel Response Algorithm for TCP"'>RFC4015</a>] possible problems
   with spurious retransmissions.  Further experimentation is needed to
   determine this and thereby move this specification from Experimental
   to the Standards Track.  For instance, RTOR has not been evaluated in
   the context of mobile networks.  Mobile networks often incur highly
   variable RTTs (delay spikes), due to e.g., handovers, and would
   therefore be a useful scenario for further experimentation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.%20%20Tracking%20Outstanding%20and%20Previously%20Unsent%20Segments"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" name="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Tracking Outstanding and Previously Unsent Segments</span>

   The method of tracking outstanding and previously unsent segments
   will probably differ depending on the actual TCP implementation.  For
   packet-based TCP implementations, tracking outstanding segments is
   often straightforward and can be implemented using a simple counter.
   For byte-based TCP stacks, it is a more complex task.  <a href="rfc5827.html#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of
   [RFC5827]</a> outlines a general method of tracking the number of
   outstanding segments.  The same method can be used for RTOR.  The
   implementation will have to track segment boundaries to form an
   understanding as to how many actual segments have been transmitted
   but not acknowledged.  This can be done by the sender tracking the
   boundaries of the rrthresh segments on the right side of the current
   window (which involves tracking rrthresh + 1 sequence numbers in
   TCP).  This could be done by keeping a circular list of the segment
   boundaries, for instance.  Cumulative ACKs that do not fall within
   this region indicate that at least rrthresh segments are outstanding,
   and therefore RTOR is not enabled.  When the outstanding window
   becomes small enough that RTOR can be invoked, a full understanding
   of the number of outstanding segments will be available from the
   rrthresh + 1 sequence numbers retained.  (Note: the implicit sequence

   number consumed by the TCP FIN bit can also be included in the
   tracking of segment boundaries.)

   Tracking the number of previously unsent segments depends on the
   segmentation strategy used by the TCP implementation, not whether it
   is packet based or byte based.  In the case where segments are formed
   directly on socket writes, the process of determining the number of
   previously unsent segments should be trivial.  In the case that
   unsent data can be segmented (or resegmented) as long as it is still
   unsent, a straightforward strategy could be to divide the amount of
   unsent data (in bytes) with the Sender Maximum Segment Size (SMSS) to
   obtain an estimate.  In some cases, such an estimation could be too
   simplistic, depending on the segmentation strategy of the TCP
   implementation.  However, this estimation is not critical to RTOR.
   The tracking of prevunsnt is only made to optimize a corner case in
   which RTOR was unnecessarily disabled.  Implementations can use a
   simplified method by setting prevunsnt to rrthresh whenever
   previously unsent data is available, and set prevunsnt to zero when
   no new data is available.  This will disable RTOR in the presence of
   unsent data and only use the number of outstanding segments to
   enable/disable RTOR.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Related%20Work"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Related Work</span>

   There are several proposals that address the problem of not having
   enough ACKs for loss recovery.  In what follows, we explain why the
   mechanism described here is complementary to these approaches:

   The limited transmit mechanism [<a href="rfc3042.html" title="&quot;Enhancing TCP's Loss Recovery Using Limited Transmit&quot;">RFC3042</a>] allows a TCP sender to
   transmit a previously unsent segment for each of the first two
   duplicate acknowledgements (dupACKs).  By transmitting new segments,
   the sender attempts to generate additional dupACKs to enable fast
   retransmit.  However, limited transmit does not help if no previously
   unsent data is ready for transmission.  [<a href="rfc5827.html" title='"Early Retransmit for TCP and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)"'>RFC5827</a>] specifies an early
   retransmit algorithm to enable fast loss recovery in such situations.
   By dynamically lowering the number of dupACKs needed for fast
   retransmit (dupthresh), based on the number of outstanding segments,
   a smaller number of dupACKs is needed to trigger a retransmission.
   In some situations, however, the algorithm is of no use or might not
   work properly.  First, if a single segment is outstanding and lost,
   it is impossible to use early retransmit.  Second, if ACKs are lost,
   early retransmit cannot help.  Third, if the network path reorders
   segments, the algorithm might cause more spurious retransmissions
   than fast retransmit.  The recommended value of RTOR's rrthresh
   variable is based on the dupthresh, but it is possible to adapt to
   allow tighter integration with other experimental algorithms such as
   early retransmit.

   Tail Loss Probe [<a href="#ref-TLP" title='"Tail Loss Probe (TLP): An Algorithm for Fast Recovery of Tail Losses"'>TLP</a>] is a proposal to send up to two "probe
   segments" when a timer fires that is set to a value smaller than the
   RTO.  A "probe segment" is a new segment if new data is available,
   else it is a retransmission.  The intention is to compensate for
   sluggish RTO behavior in situations where the RTO greatly exceeds the
   RTT, which, according to measurements reported in [<a href="#ref-TLP" title='"Tail Loss Probe (TLP): An Algorithm for Fast Recovery of Tail Losses"'>TLP</a>], is not
   uncommon.  Furthermore, TLP also tries to circumvent the congestion
   window reset to one segment by instead enabling fast recovery.  The
   probe timeout (PTO) is normally two RTTs, and a spurious PTO is less
   risky than a spurious RTO because it would not have the same negative
   effects (clearing the scoreboard and restarting with slow-start).
   TLP is a more advanced mechanism than RTOR, requiring e.g., SACK to
   work, and is often able to further reduce loss recovery times.
   However, it also noticeably increases the amount of spurious
   retransmissions, as compared to RTOR [<a href="#ref-RHB15" title='"An Evaluation of Tail Loss Recovery Mechanisms for TCP"'>RHB15</a>].

   TLP is applicable in situations where RTOR does not apply, and it
   could overrule (yielding a similar general behavior, but with a lower
   timeout) RTOR in cases where the number of outstanding segments is
   smaller than four and no new segments are available for transmission.
   The PTO has the same inherent problem of restarting the timer on an
   incoming ACK and could be combined with a strategy similar to RTOR's
   to offer more consistent timeouts.

   setsockopt().  The socket option value uses the following structure
   defined in [<a href="rfc6458.html" title='"Sockets API Extensions for the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)"'>RFC6458</a>]:

   struct sctp_assoc_value {
     sctp_assoc_t assoc_id;
     uint32_t assoc_value;
   };

   assoc_id:  This parameter is ignored for one-to-one style sockets.
      For one-to-many style sockets, this parameter indicates upon which
      association the user is performing an action.  The special
      sctp_assoc_t SCTP_{FUTURE|CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC can also be used in
      assoc_id for setsockopt().  For getsockopt(), the special value
      SCTP_FUTURE_ASSOC can be used in assoc_id, but it is an error to
      use SCTP_{CURRENT|ALL}_ASSOC in assoc_id.

   assoc_value:  A non-zero value encodes the enabling of RTO restart
      whereas a value of 0 encodes the disabling of RTO restart.

   sctp_opt_info() needs to be extended to support SCTP_RTO_RESTART.

   This document specifies an experimental sender-only modification to
   TCP and SCTP.  The modification introduces a change in how to set the
   retransmission timer's value when restarted.  Therefore, the security
   considerations found in [<a href="rfc6298.html" title="&quot;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer&quot;">RFC6298</a>] apply to this document.  No
   additional security problems have been identified with RTO Restart at
   this time.
