<meta content='To enable seamless IP-layer handover of a mobile node (MN) from one
access router (AR) to another, the MN is required to discover the
identities and capabilities of candidate ARs (CARs) for handover prior

two aspects: identifying the IP addresses of the CARs and finding
their capabilities. This process is called "candidate access router

capabilities are a good match to the preferences of the MN, is chosen

Abstract

   To enable seamless IP-layer handover of a mobile node (MN) from one
   access router (AR) to another, the MN is required to discover the
   identities and capabilities of candidate ARs (CARs) for handover
   prior to the initiation of the handover.  The act of discovery of
   CARs has two aspects: identifying the IP addresses of the CARs and
   finding their capabilities.  This process is called "candidate access
   router discovery" (CARD).  At the time of IP-layer handover, the CAR,
   whose capabilities are a good match to the preferences of the MN, is
   chosen as the target AR for handover.  The protocol described in this
   document allows a mobile node to perform CARD.

   IP mobility protocols, such as Mobile IP, enable mobile nodes to
   execute IP-level handover among access routers.  Work is underway
   [<a href="#ref-Kood03" title='"Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6"'>Kood03</a>][Malk03] to extend the mobility protocols to allow seamless
   IP handover.  Seamless IP mobility protocols will require knowledge
   of candidate access routers (CARs) to which a mobile node can be
   transferred.  The CAR discovery protocol enables the acquisition of
   information about the access routers that are candidates for the
   mobile node's next handover.

   CAR discovery involves identifying a CAR's IP address and the
   capabilities that the mobile node might use for a handover decision.
   There are cases in which a mobile node has a choice of CARs.  The
   mobile node chooses one according to a match between the mobile
   node's requirements for a handover candidate and the CAR's
   capabilities.  However, the decision algorithm itself is out of the
   scope of this document.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4066.html">RFC 4066</a>        Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD)       July 2005</span>


   The problem statement for CAR discovery is documented in [<a href="#ref-TKCK02" title='"Issues in candidate access router discovery for seamless IP-level handoffs"'>TKCK02</a>].
   In this document, a protocol is described to perform CAR discovery.
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> describes two main functions of the CAR discovery protocol.
   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> describes the core part of the CARD protocol operation.
   The protocol message format is described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>
   discusses security considerations, and <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> contains a table of
   protocol parameters.  <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> contains two alternative techniques
   for dynamically constructing the CAR table mapping between the access
   point L2 ID and Access Router IP address, which is necessary for
   reverse address translation.  The default method is static
   configuration.  <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> contains two sample scenarios for using
   CARD.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-Brad97" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>Brad97</a>].

   This document uses terminology defined in [<a href="#ref-MaKo03" title='"Mobility Related Terminology"'>MaKo03</a>].

   In addition, the following terms are used:

   Access Router (AR)

      An IP router residing in an access network and connected to one or
      more APs.  An AR offers IP connectivity to MNs.

   Candidate AR (CAR)

      An AR to which an MN has a choice when performing IP-level
      handover.

   Capability of an AR

      A characteristic of the service offered by an AR that may be of
      interest to an MN when the AR is being considered as a handover
      candidate.

   L2 ID

      An identifier of an AP that uniquely identifies that AP.  For
      example, in 802.11, this could be a MAC address of an AP.

   CARD Initiating Trigger

      An L2 trigger used to initiate the CARD process.  For example, a
      MN can initiate CARD as soon as it detects the L2 ID of a new AP
      during link layer scan.

   Access Point (AP)

      A wireless access point, identified by a MAC address, providing
      service to the wired network for wireless nodes.

   The CARD protocol accomplishes the following functions.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Reverse%20Address%20Translation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Reverse Address Translation</span>

   If an MN can listen to the L2 IDs of new APs prior to making a
   decision about IP-level handover to CARs, a mechanism is needed for
   reverse address translation.  This function of the CARD protocol
   enables the MN to map the received L2 ID of an AP to the IP address
   of the associated CAR that connects to the AP.  To get the CAR's IP
   address, the MN sends the L2 ID of the AP to the current AR, and the
   current AR provides the associated CAR's IP address to the MN.

   Information about the capabilities of CARs can assist the MN in
   making optimal handover decisions.  This capability information
   serves as input to the target AR selection algorithm.  Some of the
   capability parameters of CARs can be static, whereas others can
   change with time.

   A definition of capabilities is out of the scope of this document.
   Encoding rules for capabilities and the format of a capability
   container for capability transport are specified in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20CARD%20Protocol%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  CARD Protocol Operation</span>

   The CARD protocol allows MNs to resolve the L2 ID of one or more APs
   to the IP addresses of the associated CARs.  The L2 IDs are typically
   discovered during an operation by the MN and are potential handover
   candidates.  Additionally, CARD allows MNs to discover particular
   capabilities associated with the CARs, such as available bandwidth,
   that might influence the handover decision of the MN.  Furthermore,
   the protocol allows ARs to populate and maintain their local CAR
   table (<a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>) with the capabilities of CARs.  For this, the
   CARD protocol makes use of CARD Request and CARD Reply messages



<span class="grey">Liebsch, et al.               Experimental                      [Page 4]</span></pre>

   between an MN and its current AR (<a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>), and between an MN's
   current AR and individual CARs, respectively (<a href="#section-5.2.2">Section 5.2.2</a>).

   To allow an MN to retrieve a CAR's address and capability
   information, the CARD Request and CARD Reply messages used between an
   MN and its current AR may contain one or more access points' L2 IDs
   and the IP addresses of associated CARs, respectively.  Optionally,
   the CARD Reply messages can also contain a CAR's capability
   information.  A CAR's capabilities are specified as a list of
   attribute-value pairs, which are conveyed in a Capability Container
   message parameter.

   Information about CARs and associated capabilities MAY be used by the
   MN to perform target access router selection during its IP handover.
   The current AR returns replies according to its CAR table (see
   <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>) and returns a RESOLVER ERROR (see <a href="#section-5.1.3.1">Section 5.1.3.1</a>) if
   the request cannot be resolved.

   The CARD protocol also enables an MN to optionally indicate its
   preferences on capabilities of interest to its current AR by
   including the Preferences message parameter in the CARD Request
   message.  The MN's current AR MAY use this information to perform
   optional capability pre-filtering for optimization purposes, and it
   returns only these capabilities of interest to the requesting MN.
   The format of this optional Preferences message parameter is
   described in <a href="#section-5.1.3.2">Section 5.1.3.2</a>.

   Optionally, the MN can provide its current AR with a list of
   capability attribute-value pairs, indicating not only the capability
   parameters (attributes) required for capability pre-filtering, but
   also a specific value for a particular capability.  This allows the
   MN's current AR to perform CAR pre-filtering and to send only address
   and capability information of CARs whose capability values meet the
   requirements of the MN back to the requesting MN.  The format of this
   optional Requirements message parameter is described in <a href="#section-5.1.3.3">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-5.1.3.3">5.1.3.3</a>.

   For example, using the optional Preferences message parameter, an MN
   may indicate to its current AR that it is interested only in
   IEEE802.11a interface-specific capability parameters, as this is the
   only interface the MN has implemented.  The MN's current AR sends
   back only CARs with IEEE802.11a-specific capabilities.  Similarly,
   using the optional Requirements message parameter, an MN may indicate
   to its current AR that it is only interested in CARs that can satisfy
   a given QoS constraint.  Here, an MN sends the respective QoS
   attribute with the QoS constraint value to its current AR using the
   optional Requirements message parameter.  The QoS constraint is
   denoted as an attribute-value pair and encapsulated with the

   Requirements message parameter, which is appended to the MN-
   originated CARD Request message.  The Requirements message parameter
   may be used to indicate the cutoff values of the capabilities for any
   desired CARs.  According to the received optional list of attributes
   in the Preferences parameter or a list of attribute-value pairs in
   the Requirements message parameter, the MN's current AR MAY use these
   parameters for deciding the content of the solicited CARD Reply
   message, which is to be sent back to the MN.  Alternatively, if the
   MN's current AR does not perform optimization with regard to
   capability or CAR pre-filtering, the current AR MAY choose to
   silently ignore the optional Requirements and Preferences message
   parameter as received in the CARD Request message.

   The MN can additionally request from the AR a certification path that
   is anchored at a certificate from a shared, trusted anchor.  The MN
   includes in the CARD Request message a list of trusted anchors for
   which the MN has a certificate, and the AR replies with the
   certification path.  If no match is found, the AR returns the trusted
   anchor names from the CARD Request.  The MN can ask for a chain for
   either the current AR or a CAR.  If the trusted anchor list is
   accompanied by an AP L2 ID for the MN's current AP, the returned
   chain is for the current AR.  If the L2 ID is for an AP that the MN
   has heard during scanning and is not connected to the current AR, the
   returned chain is for a CAR.  The chain is returned as a sequence of
   CARD Reply messages, each message containing a single certificate,
   the L2 identifier for the AP sent in the CARD Request, and a router
   address for the CAR (or for the AR itself if a request was made for
   the AR).  When the chain is complete, the MN can use it to obtain the
   AR's certified key and thereby validate signatures on CARD messages
   and other messages between the MN and the current AR.  The MN only
   has to send the trusted anchor option if it does not have the
   certification path for the AR already cached.  If the MN has the
   certification path cached, through preconfiguration, through previous
   receipt of the chain from this router, or by having received the
   chain through a previous router, then the trusted anchor does not
   have to be sent.  More information about certificate exchange and its
   use in CARD security can be found in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.

   The CARD protocol operation, as described in this section,
   distinguishes signaling messages exchanged between an MN and its
   current AR from those exchanged between ARs.  Hence, descriptions of
   signaling messages in the following sections have preceding
   identifiers referring to the associated interface.  Messages that are
   exchanged between an MN and AR are designated as "MN-AR", and
   messages between ARs are designated as "AR-AR".

                Figure 1: MN-initiated CARD Protocol Overview

   Figure 1 describes the operation of the MN-AR CARD Request/Reply
   protocol and AR-AR CARD Request/Reply protocol.  On receipt of the
   access points' L2 IDs or the appearance of a CARD initiation trigger
   (1m), the MN may pass on one or more AP L2 IDs to its current AR
   using the MN-AR CARD Request message (2m).  If the MN wants its AR to
   perform capability discovery in addition to reverse address
   translation, this must be indicated in the MN-AR CARD Request message
   by setting the C-flag.  If the C-flag is not set, the AR receiving
   the CARD Request message will perform only reverse address
   translation.  The MN's current AR resolves the L2 ID to the IP
   address of the associated CAR or, if the MN has not attached any L2
   ID message parameters, just reads out all CARs' IP address
   information using the reverse address translation information (L2 ID
   to IP address mapping) from its local CAR table.  The current AR then
   returns to the MN using the MN-AR CARD Reply message (3m), the IP
   addresses of any CARs, each CAR's set of L2 IDs with CANDIDATE
   indicated in the L2 ID sub-option status field, and, if capability
   information has been requested, associated capabilities.

   For the AR-AR CARD Request/Reply protocol, the requesting AR sends a
   CARD Request message to its peer when the CAR table entries time out
   (1a).  The peer returns a CARD Reply message with the requested
   information (2a).

   ARs SHALL maintain an L2-L3 address mapping table (CAR table) that is
   used to resolve L2 IDs of candidate APs to the IP address of the
   associated CAR.  By default, this address-mapping table is configured
   statically for the CARD protocol operation.  Optionally, the CAR
   table MAY be populated dynamically.  Two possible approaches are
   described in Appendices A.1 and A.2.

   ARs SHOULD also keep and maintain individual CARs' capabilities in
   the local CAR table, with the associated capability lifetime taken
   into account.  If the lifetime of an individual capability entry has
   expired, the respective capability information is updated.  An AR may
   also initiate capability exchange prior to expiration of the
   capabilities associated with a CAR in the CAR table, thereby
   populating its CAR table.  The AR's CAR table may be implemented
   differently; therefore additional details are not provided here.  ARs
   MUST maintain their own AP-to-AR mappings and capability information
   in their CAR tables, in order to provide newly booted MNs with this
   information so that an MN can obtain the AR's certification path.

   MNs SHOULD maintain discovered address and capability information of
   CARs in a local cache to avoid requesting the same information
   repeatedly and to select an appropriate target AR from the list of
   CARs as quickly as possible when a handover is imminent.

   To initiate CARD, an MN sends a CARD Request to its current AR,
   requesting it to resolve the L2 ID of nearby access points to the IP
   address of associated CARs and also obtain capability parameters
   associated with these CARs.  If the requesting MN wants its current
   AR to resolve specific L2 IDs, the MN-AR CARD Request MUST contain
   the CARD protocol-specific L2 ID message parameters.  If the MN wants
   its AR to perform only reverse address translation without appending
   the CARs' capabilities, the MN refrains from setting the C-flag in
   the CARD Request message.  If the MN wants to perform capability
   discovery, the MN MUST set the C-flag in the CARD Request message.
   The CARD Request MAY also contain the Preferences or Requirements
   message parameter, indicating the MN's preferences on capability
   attributes of interest or its requirements on CARs' capability
   attribute-value pairs.

   If the MN appends multiple L2 ID sub-options to a CARD Request, the
   AR MUST assume that each L2 ID is associated with an AP that connects
   to a different CAR.  Since L2 IDs, address information, and
   capability information are transmitted with separate sub-options,
   each sub-option carries a Context-ID, to allow parameters that belong
   together to be matched.  Therefore, the MN MUST assign different
   Context-ID values to the L2 ID sub-options it appends to the CARD
   Request message.  The Status-Code field of the L2 ID sub-option MUST
   always be set to NONE (0x00) by the MN.  The MN MUST set the sequence
   number to a randomly generated value, and the AR MUST include the
   sequence number in all messages of the reply.  If the reply spans
   multiple messages, each message contains the same sequence number.



<span class="grey">Liebsch, et al.               Experimental                      [Page 8]</span></pre>

   Upon receipt of the corresponding MN-AR CARD Reply message, the MN
   correlates the CARD Reply with the appropriate CARD Request message
   and then processes all MN-AR CARD Reply message parameters to
   retrieve its CAR's address and capability information.  If the MN is
   unable to correlate the CARD Reply with any previously sent CARD
   Request messages, the MN SHOULD silently discard the reply.  This may
   happen when the MN reboots after sending a CARD Request message to
   the connected AR.

   An MN uses exponential backoff to retransmit the CARD Request in the
   event that a CARD Reply is not received within CARD_REQUEST_RETRY
   seconds.  The retransmitted CARD Request MUST have the same sequence
   number as the original.  With the exception of certification paths,
   which are large by nature, an AR SHOULD attempt to limit the
   information in a CARD Reply to a single message.  Should that be
   impossible, the AR MAY send the reply in multiple messages.  The last
   message of a reply MUST always have the L-flag set in the CARD Reply
   option to indicate that the message is the last for the associated
   sequence number.  An AR retransmitting replies to a CARD Request MUST
   always send the full CARD Reply sequence.  The Trusted Anchor sub-
   option and the Router Certificate sub-option provide a means whereby
   the MN can request specific certificates in a certification path, in
   the event that the CARD Reply carrying a certification path spans
   multiple messages and one of them is lost.  However, a request for
   specific certificates that were not received in the initial CARD
   Reply MUST be treated as a new request by the MN and MUST use a
   different sequence number.

   Processing the Context-ID of Address sub-options allows the MN to
   assign the resolved IP address of a specific CAR to an L2 ID.

   In some cases, an L2 ID parameter is present in a CARD Reply message.
   The Status-Code field in the L2 ID parameter indicates one of the
   following reasons for its being sent toward the MN.

   RESOLVER ERROR Status-Code indication:
      If the MN's current AR could not resolve a particular L2 ID, this
      status code is returned to the MN.

   MATCH Status-Code indication:
      If an L2 ID is encountered that shares a CAR with a previously
      resolved L2 ID, the AR returns MATCH to the MN.  This status code
      indicates that the Context-ID of this particular L2 ID sub-option
      has been set to the Context-ID of the associated CAR's Address and
      Capability Container sub-option, which is sent with this CARD
      Reply message.  This approach avoids sending the same CAR's
      address and capability information multiple times with the same
      CARD Reply message in case two or more L2 IDs resolve to the same

      CAR.  An MN uses the Context-ID received in the L2 ID sub-option
      as the key to find the serving CAR of the given AP from the
      content of the received CARD Reply message.

   CANDIDATE Status-Code indication:
      If the MN does not append any L2 ID to the CARD Request, the AR
      sends back the L2 ID and address information of all CARs.  Because
      the received parameters' Context-IDs cannot be correlated with an
      L2 ID's Context-ID of a previously sent request, the AR chooses
      values for the Context-ID and marks these candidate L2 IDs with
      CANDIDATE in the status code of the distributed L2 IDs.  However,
      individual values of L2 IDs' Context-ID allow the MN to assign a
      particular L2 ID to the associated Address and the possibly
      received Capability Container sub-option.

      As described in <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>, an MN can use CARD when it initially
      boots up to determine whether piggyback operation is possible.  An
      MN can also use CARD initially to determine the capabilities and
      certificates for an AR on which it boots up or if it cannot obtain
      the certificates beforehand.  To do this, the MN includes an L2
      Identifier option with its current AP L2 ID and the requested
      information.  The AR replies with its own information.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.2.%20%20Current%20Access%20Router%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.2" name="section-4.2.2">4.2.2</a>.  Current Access Router Operation</span>

   Upon receipt of an MN's MN-AR CARD Request, the connected AR SHALL
   resolve the requested APs' L2 ID to the IP address of any associated
   CARs.  If no L2 ID parameter has been sent with the MN-AR CARD
   Request message, the receiving AR retrieves all CARs' IP addresses
   and, if the C-flag was set in the request, the capability
   information.

   In the first case, where the AR resolves only requested L2 IDs, the
   AR does not send back the L2 ID to the requesting MN.  If, however,
   two or more L2 IDs match the same CAR information, the L2 ID sub-
   option is sent back to the MN, indicating a MATCH in the Status-Code
   field of the L2 ID.  Furthermore, the AR sets the Context-ID of the
   returned L2 ID to the value of the resolved CAR's L2 ID, Address, and
   Capability Container sub-option.  If an AR cannot resolve a
   particular L2 ID, an L2 ID sub-option is sent back to the MN,
   indicating a RESOLVER ERROR in the L2 ID sub-option's Status-Code
   field.

   In the second case, where the AR did not receive any L2 ID with a
   CARD Request, all candidate APs' L2 IDs are sent to a requesting MN
   with the CARD Reply message.  The AR marks the Status-Code of
   individual L2 IDs as CANDIDATE, indicating to the MN that the

   In any case, the AR MUST set the Context-ID of the Address and the

   associated L2 ID sub-option.

   Optionally, when allowed by local policies and supported by
   respective ARs for capability discovery, the AR MAY retrieve a subset
   of capabilities or CARs, satisfying the optionally appended
   Preferences and Requirement message parameter, from its local CAR
   table.  CARs' address information and associated capabilities are
   then delivered to the MN using the MN-AR CARD Reply message.  The

   The MN's current AR MAY initiate capability exchange with CARs either
   when it receives an MN-AR CARD Request or when it detects that one or
   more of its local CAR table's capability entries' lifetimes are about
   to expire.  An AR SHOULD preferentially utilize its CAR table to
   fulfill requests rather than signal the CAR directly, and it SHOULD
   keep the CAR table up to date for this purpose, in order to avoid
   injecting unnecessary delays into the MN response.

   The AR SHOULD issue an AR-AR CARD Request to the respective CARs if
   complete capability information of a CAR is not available in the
   current AR's CAR table, or if such information is expired or about to
   expire.  The AR-AR CARD Request message format is defined in <a href="#section-5.2.2">Section</a>

   The AR MAY append its own capabilities, which are encoded as
   attribute-value pairs and encapsulated with the Capability Container
   message parameter, to the released AR-AR CARD Request.  If the AR-AR
   CARD Request conveys the current AR's capabilities to the CAR, the
   associated Capability Container can have any value set for the
   Context-ID, as there is no need for the receiving CAR to process this

   Furthermore, the current AR MAY set the P-flag in the Capability
   Container sub-option to inform the CAR about its own capability to
   perform CARD protocol message piggybacking.

   Optionally, a current AR MAY append the Preferences sub-option to the
   AR-AR CARD Request to obtain only capability parameters of interest
   from a CAR.

   Upon receipt of the AR-AR CARD Reply, sent by the CAR in response to
   the previously sent request, the MN's current AR SHALL extract the
   capability information from the payload of the received message and
   store the received capabilities in its local CAR table.  The lifetime
   of individual capabilities is to be set according to the lifetime
   indicated for each capability received.  The values of the table
   entries' timeouts shall depend upon the nature of individual
   capabilities.

   Optionally, CARs can send unsolicited CARD Reply messages to globally
   adjacent ARs if the configuration of their APs or capabilities
   changes dynamically.  If the current AR receives an unsolicited CARD
   Reply message from a CAR for which there is an entry in its local CAR
   table, the current AR checks that the sequence number of the received
   CARD Reply has increased compared to that of the previously received
   unsolicited CARD Reply message, which has been sent from the same
   CAR.  Then, the current AR can update its local CAR table according
   to the received capabilities.  If a new CAR is added, an AR may
   receive a CARD Reply from a CAR that is not in its CAR table, or from
   a CAR that has rebooted.  In this case, the sequence number is 0.
   The requirement that ARs share an IPsec security association,
   detailed in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>, ensures that an AR never accepts CARD
   information from an unauthenticated source.

   Upon receipt of an AR-AR CARD Request, a CAR shall extract the
   sending AR's capabilities, if the sending AR has included its
   capabilities.  The CAR SHALL store the received capabilities in its
   CAR table and set the timer for individual capabilities
   appropriately.  The values of the table entries' timeouts depend on
   the nature of capabilities in the AR-AR CARD Reply message.  The CAR
   must include the same sequence number in the AR-AR CARD Reply Message
   as that received in the AR-AR CARD Request Message.  The AR-AR CARD
   Reply shall include the CAR's capabilities as list of attribute-value
   pairs in the Capability Container message parameter.  If the sending
   AR has appended an optional Preferences sub-option, the CAR MAY
   perform capability filtering and send back only those capabilities of
   interest to the requesting AR, identified according to the

   Preferences sub-option.  Because the AR-AR CARD Reply is based on a
   previously received AR-AR CARD Request, the CAR MUST set the U-flag
   of the AR-AR CARD Reply to 0.

   Optionally, the CAR MAY send an unsolicited CARD Reply message to
   globally adjacent ARs if one or more of its capability parameters
   change.  Each unsolicited CARD Reply message should have as
   destination address the adjacent AR's unicast address and must have
   the U-flag set.  Consecutive unsolicited CARD Reply messages MUST
   have the sequence number incremented accordingly, starting with 0
   when the AR boots.

   CARD supports another mode of CAR information distribution, in which
   the capabilities are piggybacked on fast handover protocol messages.
   To allow MNs and ARs appending the ICMP-option type CARD Request and
   CARD Reply (<a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>) to the ICMP-type Fast Mobile IPv6 [<a href="#ref-Kood03" title='"Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6"'>Kood03</a>]
   signaling messages, the MN and AR should know about the signaling
   peer's capability for CARD protocol message piggybacking.  This
   requires dynamic discovery of piggybacking capability using the
   P-flag in the MN-AR CARD Request and the MN-AR CARD Reply message, as
   well as in the Capability Container message parameter.  The format of
   these messages and parameters is described in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>.

   The MN sends the very first CARD Request to its current AR using the
   ICMP-type CARD main header for transport, as described in <a href="#section-4.2.1">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  If the MN supports CARD-protocol message piggybacking, the
   P-flag in this very first CARD Request message is set.  On receipt of
   the CARD Request message, the current AR learns about the MN's
   piggybacking capability.  To indicate its piggybacking capability,
   the AR sets the P-flag in the CARD Reply message.  If the AR does not
   support piggybacking, all subsequent CARD-protocol messages between
   the MN and the AR are sent stand-alone, using the CARD main header.
   If both nodes (the MN and its current AR) support CARD-protocol
   message piggybacking, subsequent CARD protocol messages can be
   conveyed as an option via the Fast Mobile IPv6 Router Solicitation
   for Proxy (RtSolPr) and Proxy Router Advertisement (PrRtAdv)
   messages.  During the CARD process, an MN learns about CARs'
   piggybacking capability at the discovery phase, as the Capability
   Container (described in <a href="#section-5.1.3.4">Section 5.1.3.4</a>) also carries a P-flag.  This
   allows the MN to perform CARD protocol message piggybacking
   immediately after a handover to a selected CAR, assuming that this
   CAR supports CARD protocol piggybacking.

   If a MN prefers the reverse address translation function of the Fast
   Mobile IPv6 protocol, it can use CARD protocol message piggybacking
   to retrieve only the CARs' capability information.  To indicate that

   reverse address translation is not required, the piggybacked CARD
   Request message MUST have the A-flag set.  This causes the current AR
   to append only Capability Container sub-options.  To associate a
   Capability Container sent as a parameter of the CARD Reply message to
   the IP address for the appropriate CAR, the Context-ID of an
   individual Capability Container MUST be used as an index, pointing to
   the associated IP address in the PrRtAdv message options.  The
   Context-ID of individual Capability Containers is set appropriately
   by the MN's current AR.  Details about how individual Context-ID
   values can be associated with a particular IP address option of the
   PrRtAdv message is out of the scope of this document.

   The MN-AR interface uses ICMP for transport.  Because ICMP messages
   are limited to a single packet, and because ICMP contains no
   provisions for retransmitting packets if signaling is lost, the CARD
   protocol incorporates provisions for improving transport performance
   on the MN-AR interface.  MNs SHOULD limit the amount of information
   requested in a single ICMP packet, as ICMP has no provision for
   fragmentation above the IP level.

   MNs and ARs use the Experimental ICMP-type main header [<a href="#ref-Ke04" title='"Instructions for Seamoby and Experimental Mobility Protocol IANA Allocations"'>Ke04</a>] when
   CARD protocol messages cannot be conveyed via ICMP-type Fast Mobile
   IPv6 [<a href="#ref-Kood03" title='"Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6"'>Kood03</a>].  The MN-AR interface MUST implement and SHOULD use the
   CARD ICMP-type header for transport.  If available, the MN-AR
   interface MAY use the ICMP-type Fast Mobile IPv6 [<a href="#ref-Kood03" title='"Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6"'>Kood03</a>] for
   transport (<a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>).

      Requirements (optional):
                     The Requirements sub-option carries information
                     about attribute-value pairs required for pre-

   CARD Requests that fail to elicit a response are retransmitted.  The
   initial retransmission occurs after a CARD_REQUEST_RETRY wait period.
   Retransmissions MUST be made with exponentially increasing wait
   intervals (doubling the wait each time).  CARD Requests should be
   retransmitted until either a response (which might be an error) has
   been obtained or CARD_RETRY_MAX seconds have occurred.  ARs MUST
   discard any CARD Requests having the same sequence number after
   CARD_RETRY_MAX seconds.  If a CARD Reply spans multiple ICMP
   messages, the same sequence number MUST be used in each message.

   MNs that retransmit a CARD Request use the same CARD sequence number.
   This allows the AR to cache its reply to the original request and
   then to send it again, should a duplicate request arrive.  This
   cached information should only be held for a maximum of
   CARD_RETRY_MAX seconds after receipt of the request.  Sequence
   numbers SHOULD be chosen randomly.  Random sequence numbers avoid
   duplicates if MNs restart frequently and simplify sequence-number
   maintenance on both the MN and AR when MNs frequently appear and
   disappear due to movement between CARs.

   Status Code:   This field allows ARs to inform a requesting entity
                  about processing results for a particular L2 ID.  The
                  L2 ID sub-option MUST be sent back to the requesting
                  entity with a CARD Reply message.

                  The following status codes are specified:

               0x00:    NONE - This value MUST be set when the L2 ID is
                        included in a CARD Request.

               0x01:    CANDIDATE - MUST be set in a CARD Reply when a
                        L2 ID sub-option is included with information
                        about candidate APs' L2 IDs.  Candidate L2 IDs
                        are sent if the CARD Request did not include a
                        specific L2 ID for resolution.  If CANDIDATE is
                        set, the AR MUST set the Context-ID field of
                        individual parameters to a value that allows
                        associated L2 ID, address, and capability
                        information to be matched on the receiver side.

               0x02:    MATCH - MUST be set in the CARD Reply to
                        identify that this L2 ID matches previously
                        resolved CAR information for a different L2 ID.
                        If MATCH is set, the AR sets the Context-ID in
                        the L2-ID sub-option to identify the matching
                        previously resolved L2 ID.

               0x03:    RESOLVER ERROR - MUST be set in the CARD Reply
                        if the L2 ID cannot be resolved.  The AR sets
                        this value for the Status Code in the returned
                        L2 ID sub-option.

   L2 type:       Indicates the interface type.  Allocated by IANA
                  [<a href="#ref-Ke04" title='"Instructions for Seamoby and Experimental Mobility Protocol IANA Allocations"'>Ke04</a>].

   L2 ID:         The variable length Layer-2 identifier of an
                  individual CAR's access point.  The length without
                  padding is determined by the L2 type.

   Because the types of access networks in which CARD might be useful
   are not currently deployed or, if they have been deployed, have not
   been extensively measured, it is difficult to know whether congestion
   will be a problem for inter-router CARD.  Part of the research task
   in preparing CARD for consideration as a candidate for possible
   standardization is to quantify this issue.  However, in order to
   avoid potential interference with production applications (should a
   prototype CARD deployment involve running over the public Internet),
   it seems prudent to recommend a default transport protocol that
   accommodates congestion.

   This suggests that implementations of CARD MUST support and that
   prototype deployments of CARD SHOULD use the Stream Control Transport
   Protocol (SCTP) [<a href="#ref-Stew00" title='"Stream Control Transmission Protocol"'>Stew00</a>] as the transport protocol between routers,
   especially if deployment over the public Internet is contemplated.
   SCTP supports congestion control, fragmentation, and partial
   retransmission based on a programmable retransmission timer.  SCTP
   also supports many advanced and complex features, such as multiple
   streams and multiple IP addresses for failover, that are not
   necessary for experimental implementation and prototype deployment of
   CARD.  The use of these SCTP features for CARD is not recommended at
   this time.

   The SCTP Payload Data Chunk carries the CARD messages.  CARD messages
   on the inter-router interface consist of just the CARD Request or
   CARD Reply options.  The User Data part of each SCTP message contains
   the CARD option for the message type.  For instance, a CARD Reply
   message is constructed by including the CARD Reply option and all the
   appropriate sub-options within the User Data part of an SCTP message.

   A single stream is used for CARD with in-sequence delivery of SCTP
   messages.  Each message, unless fragmented, corresponds to a single
   CARD query or response.  Unsolicited CARD Reply messages can also be
   sent to peers to notify them of changes in network configuration or
   capabilities.  A single stream provides simplicity.  Use of multiple
   streams to prevent head-of-line blocking is for future study.  Since
   timeliness is not an issue with inter-router CARD, and since there
   being more than one CARD transaction between two routers active at
   any one time is unlikely, having ordered delivery simplifies the
   implementation.  The Payload Protocol Identifier in the SCTP header
   is 'CARD'.  CARD uses the Seamoby SCTP port number [<a href="#ref-Ke04" title='"Instructions for Seamoby and Experimental Mobility Protocol IANA Allocations"'>Ke04</a>].

   In order to avoid generating congestion on startup, ARs MUST wait a
   random amount of time between 0 and CARD_STARTUP_WAIT seconds upon
   reboot before sending an AR-AR CARD Request to one of its CARs.  An
   AR that receives a CARD Request from another AR that is not in its
   CAR table MUST NOT solicit the AR but rather MUST wait until the AR
   sends an unsolicited CARD Reply advertising the AR's information.  An
   AR that is starting up MUST send unsolicited CARD Replies to all its
   CARs to make sure that their CAR tables are properly populated.

   The frequency of unsolicited CARD Reply messages MUST be strictly
   limited to CARD_MIN_UPDATE_INTERVAL, in order to avoid overwhelming
   CARs with traffic.  ARs are free to discard messages that arrive more
   frequently.

   If a CARD deployment will never run over the public Internet, and if
   it is known that congestion is not a problem in the access network,
   alternative transport protocols MAY be appropriate vehicles for
   experimentation.  Implementations of CARD MAY support UDP for such
   purposes.  In that case, the researcher MUST be careful to
   accommodate good Internet transport protocol engineering practices,
   such as using retransmits with exponential backoff.  In addition,
   whether SCTP is an appropriate transport protocol for all inter-
   router CARD operations is an open research question.  Investigation
   of this issue (for example, to determine whether a lighter-weight
   protocol might be more appropriate than SCTP) may be of interest to
   some researchers.

   The AR-AR interface MUST insert the CARD Request option and CARD
   Reply option directly into the body of the SCTP User Data field.  The
   sequence number for the CARD Request on the AR-AR interface MUST be
   initialized to zero when the AR reboots, and MUST be incremented
   every time a CARD Request message is sent.  The replying AR MUST
   include a sequence number from the CARD Request in the CARD Reply.
   If an unsolicited CARD Reply is sent, the sending AR MUST increment
   the sequence number.  Sequentially increasing sequence numbers allows
   the receiving AR to determine whether the information has already
   been received.

   On the AR-AR interface, the Capability Container parameter is used to
   convey capabilities between ARs.  Optionally, the Preferences
   parameter can be used for capability pre-filtering during the inter-
   AR capability discovery procedure.  Payload types and encoding rules
   are the same as those described for the respective sub-option types
   in <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> for the MN-AR interface.  The same TLV-encoded format

   order to obtain the certificates for the CAR.  The description of
   sub-options in <a href="#section-5.1.3">Section 5.1.3</a> includes information on what flag
   settings are prohibited on the AR-AR interface.

   The veracity of the CARD protocol depends on the ability of an AR to
   obtain accurate information about geographically neighboring ARs, and
   to provide accurate information about its own APs and capabilities to
   other ARs.  The CARD protocol described in the body of this document
   does not contain any support for determining the AR-to-AP mapping or
   capabilities, either for a specific AR or for a CAR.  Therefore,
   methods for determining the accuracy of the information exchanged
   between ARs are out of scope for the base CARD protocol.  The
   appendices of this document describe procedures for discovering the
   identities of the geographically adjacent ARs and APs (including
   capabilities) and discuss relevant security considerations.
   Alternatively, this information could be statically configured into
   the AR.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.2.%20%20Security%20Association%20between%20AR%20and%20AR"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" name="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Security Association between AR and AR</span>

   CARD contains support allowing ARs to exchange capability
   information.  If this protocol is not protected from modification, a
   malicious attacker can modify the information.  Also, if the
   information is delivered in plain text, a third party can read it.

   To prevent the information from being compromised, the CARD messages
   between ARs MUST be authenticated.  The messages also SHOULD be
   encrypted for privacy of the information, if required.
   Confidentiality might be required if the traffic between two ARs in
   an operator's network traversed the public Internet, for example.

   Two ARs engaging in the CARD protocol MUST use IKE [<a href="#ref-HarCar98" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>HarCar98</a>] to
   negotiate an IPsec ESP security association for message
   authentication.  If confidentiality is desired, the two ARs MUST
   additionally negotiate an ESP security association for encryption.
   Replay protection SHOULD also be enabled with IKE.  To protect CARD
   protocol messages between ARs, IPsec ESP [<a href="#ref-AtKe98" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>AtKe98</a>] MUST be used with a
   non-null integrity protection and origin authentication algorithm and
   SHOULD be used with a non-null encryption algorithm for protecting
   the confidentiality of the CARD information.

   An AR can provide the certificates for its CARs if the certificates
   are available.  The AR requests certificates from its CARs by setting
   the T flag in the CARD Request message.  All certificates are sent.

   If CARD is used to exchange information between different
   administrative domains, additional security policy issues may apply.
   Such issues are out of the scope of this document.  Use of CARD
   between administrative domains is not recommended at this time, until
   the policy issues involved are more thoroughly understood.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.3.%20%20Security%20Association%20between%20AR%20and%20MN"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" name="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  Security Association between AR and MN</span>

   A malicious node can send bogus CARD Reply messages to MNs by
   masquerading as the AR.  The MN MUST authenticate the CARD Reply
   messages from the AR.  Since establishing an IPSec security
   association between the MN and AR is likely to be a performance
   issue, IKE is not an appropriate mechanism for setting up the
   security association.  Instead, the SEND security association is used
   [<a href="#ref-Arkko04" title='"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>Arkko04</a>].  ARs MUST include a SEND Signature Option on CARD Reply
   messages.  The format of the signature option is the same for both
   IPv4 and IPv6 CARD, though SEND itself is only defined for IPv6.  A
   Mobile IPv4 ICMP Foreign Agent Advertisement option type code for the
   SEND signature option [<a href="#ref-Ke04" title='"Instructions for Seamoby and Experimental Mobility Protocol IANA Allocations"'>Ke04</a>] has been allocated.

   No authentication is required for CARD Requests since CARD
   information is provided by the AR to optimize link access.  In
   contrast, CARD Reply authentication is required because a bogus AR
   could provide the MN with CARD information that would lead the MN to
   handover to a bogus router, which could steal traffic or propagate a
   denial of service attack on the MN.  The asymmetry of the
   authentication requirement is the same as that involving Router
   Advertisements in IPv6 router discovery [<a href="#ref-Arkko04" title='"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>Arkko04</a>].

   Since CARD is a discovery protocol, confidentiality is not generally
   necessary on the MN-AR interface.  In specific cases where different
   network operators share the same access network infrastructure,
   network operators may want to hide information about operator-
   specific capabilities for business reasons.  The base CARD protocol
   contains no support for such cases.  However, should such a case
   arise in the future, an AVP for an encrypted capability can be
   defined at that time.

   Because SEND is only available in IPv6, the procedures for obtaining
   certificates differ depending on whether CARD is used with IPv4 or
   IPv6.  In IPv6, when the MN receives a CARD reply with signature from
   an AR for which it does not have a certificate, it SHOULD use SEND
   DCS/DCA to obtain the AR's certificate chain.  ARs MUST be configured
   with a certification path for this purpose, and MNs MUST be
   configured with a set of certificates for shared trusted anchors to
   allow verification of the AR certificates.  An MN may not necessarily

   need to use Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) with CARD,
   so CGA support is OPTIONAL for CARD.  A certificate profile for ARs
   is described in the SEND specification [<a href="#ref-Arkko04" title='"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)"'>Arkko04</a>].

   In IPv4, there is no DCS/DCA message for obtaining the certificate.
   If the MN does not have a certificate for the AR, the MN sends a CARD
   Request message containing the L2 ID of its current AP and one
   Trusted Anchor sub-option (<a href="#section-5.1.3.6">Section 5.1.3.6</a>) for each shared trusted
   anchor for which the MN has a certificate, to obtain the
   certification path for the current AR.  The Component field of the
   Trusted Anchor sub-option is set to 65535 to indicate that the entire
   certification path is needed.  No other options should be included in
   the request.  The AR replies by sending a CARD Reply containing the
   L2 ID sub-option sent in the request, an Address sub-option for
   itself, and a Router Certificate sub-option (<a href="#section-5.1.3.7">Section 5.1.3.7</a>)
   containing one certificate in its certification path that matches one
   of the requested trust anchors, and no other sub-options, setting the
   Context-ID of all sub-options to match.  The All Components field is
   set to the path length, and the Component field is set to the number
   of this component in the path.  If the path is longer than one
   certificate, the AR sends the L2 ID sub-option and the Address sub-
   option in the first certificate and the other certificates in
   separate ICMP messages, due to the limitation on ICMP message length,
   with the same Context-ID set on each Route Certificate sub-option,
   and with the Component field properly set.  The router SHOULD NOT
   send the trusted anchor's certificate and SHOULD send certificates in
   order from the certificate after the trusted anchor.  If the trusted
   anchor option does not match any certificate, the AR returns the
   Trusted Anchor sub-options in the reply.  The MN SHOULD immediately
   conduct a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) check on any certificates
   obtained through CARD certificate exchange, to make sure that the
   certificates are still valid.

   Certification paths for CARs may be fetched in advance of handover by
   requesting them as part of the CARD protocol.  In that case, the MN
   includes Trusted Anchor sub-options in the CARD request along with
   the L2 ID sub-option for the AP for which the CAR certificate is
   desired, and the AR replies as above, except that the L2 ID, address,
   and certificates are for the CAR instead of for the AR itself.  This
   allows the MN to skip the DCS/DCA or CARD certificate exchange when
   it moves to a new router.

   Because the amount of space in an ICMP message is limited, the router
   certification paths SHOULD be kept short.

   An AR can be overwhelmed with CARD Request messages.  The AR SHOULD
   implement a rate-limiting policy so that it does not send or process
   more than a certain number of messages per period.  The following is
   a suggested rate limiting policy.  If the number of CARD messages
   exceeds CARD_REQUEST_RATE, the AR SHOULD begin to drop messages
   randomly until the rate is reduced.  MNs SHOULD avoid sending
   messages more frequently than CARD_REQUEST_RATE.  ARs SHOULD also
   avoid sending unsolicited CARD Replies or CARD Requests more
   frequently than CARD_MIN_UPDATE_INTERVAL, but, in this case, the
   existence of an IPsec security association ensures that messages from
   unknown entities will be discarded immediately during IPsec
   processing.

   MNs MUST discard CARD Replies for which there is no outstanding CARD
   Request, as indicated by the sequence number.

   To protect against replay attacks on the AR-AR interface, ARs SHOULD
   enable replay protection when negotiating the IPsec security
   association using IKE.

   On the MN-AR interface, the MN MUST discard any CARD Replies for
   which there is no outstanding request, as determined by the sequence
   number.  For ARs, an attacker can replay a previous request from an
   MN, but the attack is without serious consequence because the MN
   ignores the reply in any case.

   This appendix provides information on two optional CAR table
   maintenance schemes for reverse address mapping in access routers.
   These schemes replace static configuration of the AP L2 ID-to-CAR IP
   address mapping in the CAR table.  Details on these mechanisms are
   out of the scope of this document.  The intention of this appendix is
   to provide only a basic idea on flexible extensions to the CARD
   protocol, as described in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Appendix%20A.1.%20%20Centralized%20Approach%20Using%20a%20Server%20Functional%20Entity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" name="appendix-A.1">Appendix A.1</a>.  Centralized Approach Using a Server Functional Entity</span>

   The centralized approach performs CARD over the MN-AR interface as
   described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> of this document.  Additionally, the
   centralized approach introduces a new entity, the CARD server, to
   assist the current AR in performing reverse address translation.  The
   centralized approach requires that neighboring ARs register with the
   CARD server to populate the reverse address translation table.  The
   registration of AR addresses with the CARD server is performed prior
   to initiation of any reverse address translation request.

   Figure A.1 illustrates a typical scenario of the centralized CARD
   operation.  In this example, ARs have registered their address
   information with a CARD server in advance.  When an MN discovers the
   L2 ID of APs during L2 scanning, it passes one or more L2 IDs to its
   current AR, and the AR resolves them to the IP address of the AR.
   For this, the AR first checks whether the mapping information is
   locally available in its CAR table.  If it is not, the MN's current
   AR queries a CARD server with the L2 ID.  In response, the CARD
   server returns the IP address of the CAR to the current AR.  Then,
   the current AR directly contacts the respective CAR and performs
   capability discovery with it.  The current AR then passes the IP
   address of the CAR and associated capabilities to the MN.  The
   current AR then stores the resolved IP address within its local CAR
   table.  The centralized CARD protocol operation introduces additional
   signaling messages, which are exchanged between the MN's current AR
   and the CARD server.  The signaling messages between an AR and the
   CARD server function are shown with the preceding identifier "AR-
   Server", referring to the associated interface.

   An initial idea of performing reverse address translation using a
   centralized server is described in [<a href="#ref-Funa02" title='"Geographically Adjacent Access Router Discovery Protocol"'>Funa02</a>].

               Handover

   This approach performs CARD over the MN-AR interface as described in
   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  However, it employs one additional message, called the
   Router Identity message, over the MN-AR interface to enable ARs to
   learn about the reverse address translation tables of their
   neighboring ARs, without being dependent on any centralized server.

   In this approach, CAR identities in the CAR table of an AR are
   maintained as soft state.  The entries for CARs are removed from the
   CAR table if they are not refreshed before the timeout period expires
   and are created or refreshed according to the following mechanism.

   The key idea behind the decentralized approach is to bootstrap and
   maintain the association between two ARs as neighbors of each other
   using the actual handover of MNs occurring between them as input.
   The first handover between any two neighboring ARs serves as the
   bootstrap handover to invoke the discovery procedure, and the
   subsequent handover serves to refresh the association between the
   neighboring ARs.  After the bootstrap handover, the MNs can perform

   CARD and thus seamless handover using the CAR information.  This idea
   was presented in [<a href="#ref-ShGi00" title='"Fast Handoff Using Neighbor Information"'>ShGi00</a>] and [<a href="#ref-Tros03" title='"A Dynamic Protocol for Candidate Access-Router Discovery"'>Tros03</a>].

   Maintenance of the CAR table is done by using an additional option
   for the CARD protocol operation performed between an MN and its
   current AR.  This message serves as Router Identity message.

   Upon the completion of an inter-AR handover, the MN SHOULD send a
   Router Identity message to its current AR.  This message contains the
   identity (IP address) of the previous AR (pAR), and can be sent as a
   specific sub-option in the MN-AR CARD Request message.  It SHOULD be
   acknowledged with the MN-AR CARD Reply.  The Router Identity message
   enables the MN's current AR to learn that the pAR (still) has an AP
   whose coverage overlaps with one of the APs of the current AR, and
   vice versa.  With this information, the MN's current AR can create or
   refresh an entry for the pAR as its neighbor.  If handover is no
   longer possible between two ARs, the associated entries eventually
   timeout and are removed from each AR's CAR table.

   Prior to trusting the MN's report, however, the current AR may
   perform a number of checks to ensure the validity of the received
   information.  One simple method is to verify the accuracy of the
   Router Identity message by sending an AR-AR CARD Request message to
   the pAR.  The AR-AR CARD Request includes the identity of the MN.
   Upon receiving this message, the pAR verifies that the MN was indeed
   attached to it during a reasonable past interval and responds to the
   current AR.  In this way, each handover of a MN results in a bi-
   directional discovery process between the two participating ARs.

   Upon receiving a positive verification response, the current AR
   creates or refreshes, as applicable, the entry for the pAR in its
   local CAR table.  In the former case, the current AR and the pAR
   exchange capabilities using the AR-AR CARD Request and AR-AR CARD
   Reply protocol messages.  When a new entry is created, the ARs MUST
   exchange their reverse address translation tables.  They may exchange
   other capabilities at this time or may defer exchange to a later time
   when some MN undergoing handover between them performs CARD as
   described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  In the latter (refresh) case, ARs may
   exchange capabilities or defer exchanges until a later time when
   another MN undergoes handover.

   Finally, note that in a handover-based protocol, a first handover
   between a pAR and an MN's current AR cannot use CARD, as this
   handover bootstraps the CAR table.  However, in the long term, such a
   handover will only amount to a small fraction of total successful
   handover between the two ARs.  Also, if the MN engaging in such a
   first handover is running a non-delay sensitive application at the
   time of handover, the user may not even realize its impact.

   This section provides two examples of application scenarios for CARD
   protocol operation.  One scenario describes a CARD protocol operation
   in a Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) network, providing access to the
   infrastructure via wireless LAN Access Points and associated Access
   Routers.  A second scenario describes CARD protocol operation in a
   Mobile IPv6-enabled network, which has enhanced support for fast
   handover integrated (Fast Mobile IPv6), also providing wireless LAN
   access to the infrastructure.

   This application scenario assumes a moving MN having access to the
   infrastructure through wireless LAN (IEEE802.11) APs.  Mobility
   management is performed using the Mobile IPv6 protocol.  The
   following figure illustrates the assumed access network design.

   A Mobile IPv6 Home Agent (HA) maintains location information for the

   address for the subnet 1, supported by AR1.  As the MN moves, the

   increasing link-quality as candidate APs for a handover.  To

   facilitate decision making, parameters associated with ARs are taken
   into account during the decision process.  The AR-related parameters
   can be, for example, available QoS resources or the type of access
   technologies supported from an AR.  To learn about these candidate
   ARs' capabilities and associated IP address information, the MN
   performs CARD.  This requires retrieving information about candidate
   APs' L2 IDs.  Furthermore, associated link-quality parameters are
   retrieved to ascertain whether approaching APs are eligible
   candidates for a handover.  If AP2 and AP3 are suitable candidate
   APs, the MN encapsulates both L2 IDs (AP2 and AP3) into a CARD
   Request message, using the L2 ID sub-option, and sends the message to
   its current AR (AR1).

   AR1 resolves each L2 ID listed in L2 ID options to the associated IP
   address of the respective CAR, making use of its local CAR table.
   According to the environment illustrated in Figure B.1, the
   associated AR IP address of the candidate AP2 will be the same as the
   MN is currently attached to, which is AR1.  The corresponding IP
   address of the candidate AR, to which AP3 is connected, is the
   address of AR2.  IP addresses of the MN's CARs are now known to AR1,
   which retrieves the CARs' capabilities from the CAR table.  Assuming
   that it has valid entries for respective capability parameters to
   refresh dynamic capabilities, whose associated lifetimes in AR1's CAR
   table have expired, AR1 performs Inter-AR CARD for capability
   discovery.  Since capability information for AR1 is known to AR1, a
   respective Inter-AR CARD Request is sent only to AR2.  In response,
   AR2 sends a CARD Reply message back to AR1, encapsulating the
   requested capability parameters with the signaling message in a
   Capability Container sub-option.

   Next, AR1 sends its own capabilities and the dynamically discovered
   ones of AR2 back to the MN via a CARD Reply message.  Furthermore,
   AR1 stores the capability parameters of AR2 with the associated
   lifetimes in its local CAR table.

   Upon receipt of the CARD Reply message, the MN performs target AR
   selection, taking AR1's and AR2's capability parameters and
   associated APs' link-quality parameters into account.  If the
   selected AP is AP2, no IP handover needs to be performed.  If AP3 and
   the associated AR2 are selected, the MN needs to perform an IP
   handover according to the Mobile IPv6 protocol operation.

   This application scenario assumes that ARs can perform the fast
   handover protocol sequence for Mobile IPv6 [<a href="#ref-Kood03" title='"Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6"'>Kood03</a>].  The MN scans
   for new APs for handover, similar to Figure B.1.  To discover the ARs
   (CARs), the MN attaches a MN-AR CARD Request option to the ICMP-type
   Fast Mobile IPv6 RtSolPr message, which is sent to the MN's current
   AR (pAR, previous AR).

   Candidate APs' L2 IDs are encapsulated using the CARD protocol's L2
   ID sub-options, which allow the MN to send multiple L2 IDs of
   candidate APs to its current AR.  (This potentially replaces the "New
   Attachment Point Link-Layer Address" option of the Fast Mobile IPv6
   protocol.)

   The pAR resolves the received list of candidate APs' L2 IDs to the IP
   addresses of associated CARs.  The pAR checks its local CAR table to
   retrieve information about the CARs' capabilities.  If any table
   entries have expired, the pAR acquires this CAR's capabilities by
   sending an AR-AR CARD Request to the respective CAR.  The CAR replies
   with an AR-AR CARD Reply message, encapsulating all capabilities in a
   Capability Container sub-option and attaching them to the CARD Reply
   option.  On receipt of the CARs' capability information, the pAR
   updates its local CAR table and forwards the address and capability
   information to the MN by attaching a MN-AR CARD Reply option to the
   Fast Mobile IPv6 PrRtAdv message.  When the MN's handover is
   imminent, the MN selects its new AR and the associated new AP from
   the discovered list of CARs.  According to the Fast Mobile IPv6
   protocol, the MN notifies the pAR of the selected new AR with the
   Fast Binding Update (F-BU) message, allowing the pAR to perform a
   fast handover according to the Fast Mobile IPv6 protocol.

   Optionally, the pAR could perform selection of an appropriate new AR
   on behalf of the MN after the pAR has the MN's CARs' addresses and
   associated capabilities available.  The MN must send its requirements
   for the selection process to its pAR together with the MN-AR CARD
   Request message After the pAR has selected the MN's new AR, the
   address and associated capabilities of the chosen new AR are sent to
   the MN with the CARD Reply option in the Fast Mobile IPv6 PrRtAdv
   message.

          Figure B.3. Fast Handover Protocol Sequence with
                      CARD Protocol Options

   * In Figure B.3, the CARD protocol interaction between the pAR and
     CARs is only required if the lifetime of any capability entries in
     the pAR's CAR table have expired.  Otherwise, the pAR can respond
     to the requesting MN immediately after retrieving the CARs'
     addresses and capability information from its CAR table.
