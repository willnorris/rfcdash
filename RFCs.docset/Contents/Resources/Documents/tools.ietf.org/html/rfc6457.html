<meta content='The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path
computation in support of traffic engineering in networks controlled
by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS).
MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed from layered client/server
networks. It is advantageous for overall network efficiency to provide
end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers. PCE is
a candidate solution for such requirements.  Generic requirements for
a communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and
PCEs are presented in RFC 4657, "Path Computation Element (PCE)
Communication Protocol Generic Requirements". Generic requirements for
a PCE discovery protocol are presented in RFC 4674, "Requirements for
Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery".  This document complements
the generic requirements and presents detailed sets of PCC-PCE
communication protocol requirements and PCE discovery protocol
requirements for inter-layer traffic engineering. This document is not

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path
   computation in support of traffic engineering in networks controlled
   by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS).

   MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed from layered client/server
   networks.  It is advantageous for overall network efficiency to
   provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network
   layers.  PCE is a candidate solution for such requirements.

   Generic requirements for a communication protocol between Path
   Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in <a href="rfc4657.html">RFC 4657</a>, "Path
   Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic
   Requirements".  Generic requirements for a PCE discovery protocol are
   presented in <a href="rfc4674.html">RFC 4674</a>, "Requirements for Path Computation Element
   (PCE) Discovery".

   This document complements the generic requirements and presents
   detailed sets of PCC-PCE communication protocol requirements and PCE
   discovery protocol requirements for inter-layer traffic engineering.

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [<a href="rfc4655.html" title='"A Path Computation Element (PCE)-Based Architecture"'>RFC4655</a>] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph and applying computational constraints.

   A network may comprise multiple layers.  These layers may represent
   the separation of technologies (e.g., Packet Switch Capable (PSC),
   Time Division Multiplex (TDM), lambda switch capable (LSC)) into
   GMPLS regions [<a href="rfc3945.html" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Architecture"'>RFC3945</a>], the separation of data plane switching

   granularity levels (e.g., PSC-1 and PSC-2 or Virtual Circuit 4 (VC4)
   and VC12) into GMPLS layers [<a href="rfc5212.html" title='"Requirements for GMPLS-Based Multi- Region and Multi-Layer Networks (MRN/MLN)"'>RFC5212</a>], or a distinction between
   client and server networking roles (e.g., commercial or
   administrative separation of client and server networks).  In this
   multi-layer network, Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in lower layers are
   used to carry upper-layer LSPs.  The network topology formed by
   lower-layer LSPs and advertised to the higher layer is called a
   "Virtual Network Topology (VNT)" [<a href="rfc5212.html" title='"Requirements for GMPLS-Based Multi- Region and Multi-Layer Networks (MRN/MLN)"'>RFC5212</a>].

   In layered networks under the operation of Multiprotocol Label
   Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   protocols, it is important to provide mechanisms to allow global
   optimization of network resources.  That is, to take into account all
   layers, rather than optimizing resource utilization at each layer
   independently.  This allows better network efficiency to be achieved.
   This is what we call "inter-layer traffic engineering".  This
   includes mechanisms allowing computation of end-to-end paths across
   layers (known as "inter-layer path computation") and mechanisms for
   control and management of the VNT by setting up and releasing LSPs in
   the lower layers [<a href="rfc5212.html" title='"Requirements for GMPLS-Based Multi- Region and Multi-Layer Networks (MRN/MLN)"'>RFC5212</a>].

   Inter-layer traffic engineering is included in the scope of the PCE
   architecture [<a href="rfc4655.html" title='"A Path Computation Element (PCE)-Based Architecture"'>RFC4655</a>], and PCE can provide a suitable mechanism for
   resolving inter-layer path computation issues.  The applicability of
   the PCE-based path computation architecture to inter-layer traffic
   engineering is described in [<a href="rfc5623.html" title='"Framework for PCE-Based Inter-Layer MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5623</a>].

   This document presents sets of requirements for communication between
   Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs using the PCE Communication
   Protocol (PCEP) and for PCE discovery for inter-layer traffic

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Motivation%20for%20PCE-Based%20Inter-Layer%20Path%20Computation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Motivation for PCE-Based Inter-Layer Path Computation</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC4206" name="ref-RFC4206">RFC4206</a>] defines a way to signal an MPLS or a GMPLS LSP with an
   explicit route in a higher layer of a network that includes hops
   traversed by LSPs in lower layers of the network.  The computation of
   end-to-end paths across layers is called "inter-layer path
   computation".

   An LSR in the higher layer might not have information on the topology
   of lower layers, particularly in an overlay or augmented model;
   hence, it might not be able to compute an end-to-end path across
   layers.

   PCE-based inter-layer path computation consists of relying on one or
   more PCEs to compute an end-to-end path across layers.  This could
   rely on a single PCE path computation where the PCE has topology
   information about multiple layers and can directly compute an end-to-
   end path across layers considering the topology of all of the layers.
   Alternatively, the inter-layer path computation could be performed as
   a multiple PCE computation, where each member of a set of PCEs has
   information about the topology of one or more layers, but not all
   layers, and they collaborate to compute an end-to-end path.

   Consider a two-layer network where the higher-layer network is a
   packet-based IP/MPLS or GMPLS network and the lower-layer network is
   a GMPLS-controlled optical network.  An ingress LSR in the higher-
   layer network tries to set up an LSP to an egress LSR also in the
   higher-layer network across the lower-layer network, and it needs a
   path in the higher-layer network.  However, suppose that there is no
   TE link between border LSRs, which are located on the boundary
   between the higher-layer and lower-layer networks, and that the
   ingress LSR does not have topology visibility in the lower layer.  If
   a single-layer path computation is applied for the higher layer, the
   path computation fails.  On the other hand, inter-layer path
   computation is able to provide a route in the higher layer and a
   suggestion that a lower-layer LSP be set up between border LSRs,
   considering both layers as TE topologies.

   Further discussion of the application of PCE to inter-layer path
   computation can be found in [<a href="rfc5623.html" title='"Framework for PCE-Based Inter-Layer MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5623</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20PCC-PCE%20Communication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  PCC-PCE Communication</span>

   PCEP MUST allow requests and replies for inter-layer path
   computation.

   This requires no additional messages, but it implies the following
   additional constraints to be added to PCEP.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.1.%20%20Control%20of%20Inter-Layer%20Path%20Computation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" name="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Control of Inter-Layer Path Computation</span>

   A request from a PCC to a PCE MUST support the inclusion of an
   optional indication of whether inter-layer path computation is
   allowed.  In the absence of such an indication, the default is that
   inter-layer path computation is not allowed.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.2.%20%20Control%20of%20the%20Type%20of%20Path%20to%20Be%20Computed"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.2" name="section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  Control of the Type of Path to Be Computed</span>

   The PCE computes and returns a path to the PCC that the PCC can use
   to build a higher-layer or lower-layer LSP once converted to an
   Explicit Route Object (ERO) for use in RSVP - Traffic Engineering
   (RSVP-TE) signaling.  There are two options [<a href="rfc5623.html" title='"Framework for PCE-Based Inter-Layer MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5623</a>].

   -  Option 1: Mono-Layer Path.  The PCE computes a "mono-layer" path,
      i.e., a path that includes only TE links from the same layer.

   -  Option 2: Multi-Layer Path.  The PCE computes a "multi-layer"
      path, i.e., a path that includes TE links from distinct layers
      [<a href="rfc4206.html" title='"Label Switched Paths (LSP) Hierarchy with Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE)"'>RFC4206</a>].

   It may be necessary or desirable for a PCC to control the type of
   path that is produced by a PCE.  For example, a PCC may know that it
   is not possible, for technological or policy reasons, to signal a
   multi-layer path and that a mono-layer path is required, or the PCC
   may know that it does not wish the layer border node to have control
   of path computation.  In order to make this level of control
   possible, PCEP MUST allow the PCC to select the path types to be
   computed, and that may be returned, by choosing one or more from the
   following list:

   -  A mono-layer path that is specified by strict hop(s).  The path
      may include virtual TE link(s).

   -  A mono-layer path that includes loose hop(s).

   -  A multi-layer path that can include the path (as strict or loose
      hops) of one or more lower-layer LSPs not yet established.

   The path computation response from a PCE to a PCC MUST report the
   type of path computed, and where a multi-layer path is returned, PCEP
   MUST support the inclusion, as part of end-to-end path, of the path
   of the lower-layer LSPs to be established.






<span class="grey">Takeda, et al.                Informational                     [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-6" id="page-6" name="page-6"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6457.html">RFC 6457</a>              PCE Inter-Layer Requirements         December 2011</span>


   If a response message from a PCE to PCC carries a mono-layer path
   that is specified by strict hops but includes virtual TE link(s),
   includes loose hop(s), or carries a multi-layer path that can include
   the complete path of one or more lower-layer LSPs not yet
   established, the signaling of the higher-layer LSP may trigger the
   establishment of the lower-layer LSPs (triggered signaling).  The
   triggered signaling may increase the higher-layer connection setup
   latency.  An ingress LSR for the higher-layer LSP, or a PCC, needs to
   know whether or not triggered signaling is required.

   A request from a PCC to a PCE MUST allow indicating whether or not
   triggered signaling is acceptable.

   A response from a PCE to a PCC MUST allow indicating whether or not
   the computed path requires triggered signaling.

   Note that a PCE may not be able to distinguish virtual TE links from
   regular TE links.  In such cases, even if a request from a PCC to a
   PCE indicates that triggered signaling is not acceptable, a PCE may
   choose virtual TE links in path computation.  Therefore, when a
   network uses virtual TE links and a PCE is not able to distinguish
   virtual TE links from regular TE links, a PCE MAY choose virtual TE
   links even if a request from a PCC to a PCE indicates triggered
   signaling is not acceptable.

   Also, note that an ingress LSR of a higher-layer or lower-layer LSP
   may be present in multiple layers.  Thus, even when a mono-layer path
   is requested or supplied, PCEP MUST be able to indicate the
   required/provided path layer.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.3.%20%20Communication%20of%20Inter-Layer%20Constraints"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.3" name="section-3.1.3">3.1.3</a>.  Communication of Inter-Layer Constraints</span>

   A request from a PCC to a PCE MUST support the inclusion of
   constraints for a multi-layer path.  This includes control over which
   network layers may, must, or must not be included in the computed
   path.  Such control may be expressed in terms of the switching types
   of the layer networks.

   Furthermore, it may be desirable to constrain the number of layer
   boundaries crossed (i.e., the number of adaptations in the sense used
   in [<a href="rfc5212.html" title='"Requirements for GMPLS-Based Multi- Region and Multi-Layer Networks (MRN/MLN)"'>RFC5212</a>] performed on the end-to-end path), so PCEP SHOULD
   include a constraint or objective function to minimize or cap the
   number of adaptations on a path and a mechanism to report that number
   when a path is supplied.

   The path computation request MUST also allow for different objective
   functions to be applied within different network layers.  For
   example, the path in a packet-network may need to be optimized for
   least delay using the IGP metric as a measure of delay, while the
   path in an underlying TDM network might be optimized for fewest hops.

   The concept of adaptation is used here as introduced in [<a href="rfc5212.html" title='"Requirements for GMPLS-Based Multi- Region and Multi-Layer Networks (MRN/MLN)"'>RFC5212</a>].

   It MUST be possible for the path computation request to indicate the
   desired adaptation function at the end points of the lower-layer LSP
   that is being computed.  This will be particularly important where
   the ingress and egress LSR participate in more than one layer network
   but may not be capable of all associated adaptations.

   When each layer is in scope of a different PCE, which only has access
   to the topology information of its layer, the PCEs of each layer need
   to cooperate to perform inter-layer path computation.  In this case,
   communication between PCEs is required for inter-layer path
   computation.  A PCE that behaves as a client is defined as a PCC
   [<a href="rfc4655.html" title='"A Path Computation Element (PCE)-Based Architecture"'>RFC4655</a>].

   PCEP MUST allow requests and replies for multiple PCE inter-layer
   path computation.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.6.%20%20Inter-Layer%20Diverse%20Paths"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.6" name="section-3.1.6">3.1.6</a>.  Inter-Layer Diverse Paths</span>

   PCEP MUST allow for the computation of diverse inter-layer paths.  A
   request from a PCC to a PCE MUST support the inclusion of multiple
   path requests, with the desired level of diversity at each layer
   (link, node, Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG)).

   In the case where there are several PCEs with distinct capabilities
   available, a PCC has to select one or more appropriate PCEs.  For
   that purpose, the PCE discovery mechanism MAY support the disclosure
   of some detailed PCE capabilities.  A PCE MAY (to be consistent with
   the above text and <a href="rfc4674.html">RFC 4674</a>) be able to advise the following PCE
   capabilities related to inter-layer path computation:

   -  Support for inter-layer path computation

   -  Support for mono-layer/multi-layer paths

   -  Support for inter-layer constraints

   -  Support for adaptation capability

   -  Support for inter-PCE communication

   An individual PCE MAY elect to support inter-layer computations and
   advertise its capabilities as described in the previous sections.
   PCE implementations MAY provide a configuration switch to allow
   support of inter-layer path computations to be enabled or disabled.
   When the level of support is changed, this SHOULD be re-advertised.

   However, a PCE MAY also elect to support inter-layer computations,
   but not to advertise the fact, so that only those PCCs configured to
   know of the PCE and its capabilities can use it.

   Support for, and advertisement of support for, inter-layer path
   computation MAY be subject to policy and a PCE MAY hide its inter-
   layer capabilities from certain PCCs by not advertising them through
   the discovery protocol and not reporting them to the specific PCCs in
   any PCEP capabilities exchange.  Further, a PCE MAY be directed by
   policy to refuse an inter-layer path computation request for any
   reason including, but not limited to, the identity of the PCC that
   makes the request.

   A further discussion of policy-enabled path computation can be found

   PCEP extensions to support inter-layer computations MUST be

   objects MAY be provided in the same MIB module as used for general
   PCEP control and monitoring [<a href="#ref-PCEP-MIB" title='"PCE communication protocol (PCEP) Management Information Base"'>PCEP-MIB</a>] or MAY be provided in a new

   No changes are necessary to the liveness detection and monitoring
   requirements as already embodied in [<a href="rfc4657.html" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements"'>RFC4657</a>].  It should be noted,
   however, that inter-layer path computations might require extended
   cooperation between PCEs (as is also the case for inter-AS
   (Autonomous System) and inter-area computations), and so the liveness
   detection and monitoring SHOULD be applied to each PCEP communication
   and aggregated to report the behavior of an individual PCEP request
   to the originating PCC.

   In particular, where a request is forwarded between multiple PCEs,
   neither the PCC nor the first PCE can monitor the liveness of all
   PCE-PCE connections or of the PCEs themselves.  In this case,
   suitable performance of the original PCEP request relies on each PCE
   operating correct monitoring procedures and correlating any failures
   back to the PCEP requests that are outstanding.  These requirements
   are no different from those for any cooperative PCE usage, and they
   are expected already to be covered by general, and by inter-AS and
   inter-area, implementations.  Such a procedure is specified in
   [<a href="rfc5441.html" title='"A Backward-Recursive PCE-Based Computation (BRPC) Procedure to Compute Shortest Constrained Inter-Domain Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths"'>RFC5441</a>].  In addition, [<a href="rfc5886.html" title='"A Set of Monitoring Tools for Path Computation Element (PCE)-Based Architecture"'>RFC5886</a>] specifies mechanisms to gather

   There are no additional requirements beyond those expressed in
   [<a href="rfc4657.html" title='"Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements"'>RFC4657</a>] for verifying the correct operation of the PCEP.  Note that
   verification of the correct operation of the PCE and its algorithms

   A PCE operates on a topology graph that may be built using
   information distributed by TE extensions to the routing protocol
   operating within the network.  In order that the PCE can select a
   suitable path for the signaling protocol to use to install the inter-
   layer LSP, the topology graph must include information about the
   inter-layer signaling and forwarding (i.e., adaptation) capabilities
   of each LSR in the network.

   Whatever means are used to collect the information to build the
   topology graph, the graph MUST include the requisite information.  If
   the TE extensions to the routing protocol are used, these SHOULD
   satisfy the requirements as described in [<a href="rfc5212.html" title='"Requirements for GMPLS-Based Multi- Region and Multi-Layer Networks (MRN/MLN)"'>RFC5212</a>].

   This section examines the impact on network operations of the use of
   a PCE for inter-layer traffic engineering.  It does not present any
   further requirements on the PCE or PCC, for the PCEP or for
   deployment.

   The use of a PCE to compute inter-layer paths is not expected to have
   significant impact on network operations if the upper-layer traffic
   engineering practices are aware of the frequent changes that might
   occur in the VNT.  It should also be noted that the introduction of
   inter-layer support to a PCE that already provides mono-layer path
   computation might change the loading of the PCE and that might have
   an impact on the network behavior especially during recovery periods
   immediately after a network failure.

   On the other hand, it is envisioned that the use of inter-layer path
   computation will have significant benefits to the operation of a
   multi-layer network including improving the network resource usage
   and enabling a greater number of higher-layer LSPs to be supported.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Inter-layer traffic engineering with PCE may raise new security
   issues when PCE-PCE communication is used between different layer
   networks for inter-layer path computation.  Security issues may also
   exist when a single PCE is granted full visibility of TE information
   that applies to multiple layers.

   The formal introduction of a VNT Manager component, as described in
   [<a href="rfc5623.html" title='"Framework for PCE-Based Inter-Layer MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5623</a>], provides the basis for the application of inter-layer
   security and policy.

   It is expected that solutions for inter-layer protocol extensions
   will address these issues in detail.
