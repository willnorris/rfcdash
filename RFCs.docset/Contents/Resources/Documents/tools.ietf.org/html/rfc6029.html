Abstract

   A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by
   peer-to-peer (P2P) applications used originally for file sharing, and
   more recently for real-time communications and live media streaming.
   Such applications discover a route to each other through an overlay
   network with little knowledge of the underlying network topology.  As
   a result, they may choose peers based on information deduced from
   empirical measurements, which can lead to suboptimal choices.  This
   document, a product of the P2P Research Group, presents a survey of
   existing literature on discovering and using network topology
   information for Application-Layer Traffic Optimization.

   A significant part of today's Internet traffic is generated by peer-
   to-peer (P2P) applications, used originally for file sharing, and
   more recently for real-time multimedia communications and live media
   streaming.  P2P applications pose serious challenges to the Internet
   infrastructure; by some estimates, P2P systems are so popular that
   they make up anywhere between 40% and 85% of the entire Internet
   traffic [<a href="#ref-Karagiannis" title='"Is P2P dying or just hiding?"'>Karagiannis</a>], [<a href="#ref-LightReading" title='"Controlling P2P traffic"'>LightReading</a>], [<a href="#ref-LinuxReviews" title="&quot;Peer to peer network traffic may account for up to 85% of Internet's bandwidth usage&quot;">LinuxReviews</a>], [<a href="#ref-Parker" title='"The true picture of peer-to-peer filesharing"'>Parker</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-Glasner" title='"P2P fuels global bandwidth binge"'>Glasner</a>].

   P2P systems ensure that popular content is replicated at multiple
   instances in the overlay.  But perhaps ironically, a peer searching
   for that content may ignore the topology of the latent overlay
   network and instead select among available instances based on
   information it deduces from empirical measurements, which in some
   particular situations may lead to suboptimal choices.  For example, a
   shorter round-trip time estimation is not indicative of the bandwidth
   and reliability of the underlying links, which have more of an
   influence than delay for large file transfer P2P applications.

   Most Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) -- the data structures that impose
   a specific ordering for P2P overlays -- use greedy forwarding
   algorithms to reach their destination, making locally optimal
   decisions that may not turn out to be globally optimized [<a href="#ref-Gummadi" title='"The impact of DHT routing geometry on resilience and proximity"'>Gummadi</a>].
   This naturally leads to the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
   (ALTO) problem [<a href="rfc5693.html" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem Statement"'>RFC5693</a>]: how to best provide the topology of the
   underlying network while at the same time allowing the requesting
   node to use such information to effectively reach the node on which
   the content resides.  Thus, it would appear that P2P networks with
   their application-layer routing strategies based on overlay
   topologies are in direct competition against the Internet routing and
   topology.

   One way to solve the ALTO problem is to build distributed
   application-level services for location and path selection [<a href="#ref-Francis" title='"IDMaps: A global Internet host distance estimation service"'>Francis</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-Ng" title='"Predicting internet network distance with coordinates-based approaches"'>Ng</a>], [<a href="#ref-Dabek" title='"Vivaldi: A Decentralized Network Coordinate System"'>Dabek</a>], [<a href="#ref-Costa" title='"PIC: Practical Internet coordinates for distance estimation"'>Costa</a>], [<a href="#ref-Wong" title='"Meridian: A lightweight network location service without virtual coordinates"'>Wong</a>], [<a href="#ref-Madhyastha" title='"iPlane: an information plane for distributed services"'>Madhyastha</a>] in order to enable peers
   to estimate their position in the network and to efficiently select
   their neighbors.  Similar solutions have been embedded into P2P
   applications such as Vuze [<a href="#ref-Vuze" title='"Vuze bittorrent client"'>Vuze</a>].  A slightly different approach is
   to have the Internet service provider (ISP) take a proactive role in
   the routing of P2P application traffic; the means by which this can
   be achieved have been proposed [<a href="#ref-Aggarwal" title='"Can ISPs and P2P users cooperate for improved performance?"'>Aggarwal</a>], [<a href="#ref-Xie" title='"P4P: Explicit Communications for Cooperative Control Between P2P and Network Providers"'>Xie</a>], [<a href="#ref-Saucez" title='"Implementation and Preliminary Evaluation of an ISP- Driven Informed Path Selection"'>Saucez</a>].  There is
   an intrinsic struggle between the layers -- P2P overlay and network
   underlay -- when performing the same service (routing); however,
   there are strategies to mitigate this dichotomy [<a href="#ref-Seetharaman" title='"Preemptive Strategies to Improve Routing Performance of Native and Overlay Layers"'>Seetharaman</a>].

   Gummadi et al. [<a href="#ref-Gummadi" title='"The impact of DHT routing geometry on resilience and proximity"'>Gummadi</a>] compare popular DHT algorithms, and besides
   analyzing their resilience, provide an accurate evaluation of how
   well the logical overlay topology maps on the physical network layer.
   In their paper, relying only on measurements independently performed
   by overlay nodes without the support of additional location
   information provided by external entities, they demonstrate that the
   most efficient algorithms in terms of resilience and proximity
   performance are those based on the simplest geometric concept (i.e.,
   the ring geometry, rather than tree structures, butterfly networks,
   and hybrid geometries).

   Regardless of the geometrical properties of the distributed data
   structures involved, interactions between application-layer overlays
   and the underlying networks are a rich area of investigation.  The
   available literature in this field can be divided into two categories
   (Figure 1): using application-level techniques to estimate topology,
   and using some kind of layer cooperation to estimate topology.

   Estimating network topology information on the application layer has
   been an area of active research.  Early systems used triangulation
   techniques to bound the distance between two hosts using a common
   landmark host.  In such a technique, given a cost function C, a set
   of vertexes V and their corresponding edges, the triangle inequality
   holds if for any triple {a, b, c} in V, C(a, c) is always less than
   or equal to C(a, g) + C(b, c).  The cost function C could be
   expressed in terms of desirable metrics such as bandwidth or latency.

   We note that the techniques presented in this section are only
   representative of the sizable research in this area.  Rather than

   trying to enumerate an exhaustive list, we have chosen certain
   techniques because they represent an advance in the area that further
   led to derivative works.

   Francis et al. proposed IDMaps [<a href="#ref-Francis" title='"IDMaps: A global Internet host distance estimation service"'>Francis</a>], a system where one or more
   special hosts called tracers are deployed near an autonomous system.
   The distance measured in round-trip time (RTT) between hosts A and B
   is estimated as the cumulative distance between A and its nearest
   tracer Ta, plus the distance between B and its nearest tracer Tb,
   plus the shortest distance from Ta to Tb.  To aid in scalability
   beyond that provided by the client-server design of IDMaps, Ng
   et al. proposed a P2P-based Global Network Positioning (GNP)
   architecture [<a href="#ref-Ng" title='"Predicting internet network distance with coordinates-based approaches"'>Ng</a>].  GNP was a network coordinate system based on
   absolute coordinates computed from modeling the Internet as a
   geometric space.  It proposed a two-part architecture: in the first
   part, a small set of finite distributed hosts called landmarks
   compute their own coordinates in a fixed geometric space.  In the
   second part, a host wishing to participate computes its own
   coordinates relative to those of the landmark hosts.  Thus, armed
   with the computed coordinates, hosts can then determine interhost
   distance as soon as they discover each other.

   Both IDMaps and GNP require fixed network infrastructure support in
   the form of tracers or landmark hosts; this often introduces a single
   point of failure and inhibits scalability.  To combat this, new
   techniques were developed that embedded the network topology in a
   low-dimensional coordinate space to enable network distance
   estimation through vector analysis.  Costa et al. introduced
   Practical Internet Coordinates (PIC) [<a href="#ref-Costa" title='"PIC: Practical Internet coordinates for distance estimation"'>Costa</a>].  While PIC used the
   notion of landmark hosts, it did not require explicit network support
   to designate specific landmark hosts.  Any node whose coordinates
   have been computed could act as a landmark host.  When a node joined
   the system, it probed the network distance to some landmark hosts.
   Then, it obtained the coordinates of each landmark host and computed
   its own coordinates relative to each landmark host, subject to the
   constraint of minimizing the error in the predicted distance and
   computed distance.

   Like PIC, Vivaldi [<a href="#ref-Dabek" title='"Vivaldi: A Decentralized Network Coordinate System"'>Dabek</a>] proposed a fully distributed network
   coordinate system without any distinguished hosts.  Whenever a node A
   communicates with another node B, it measures the RTT to that node
   and learns that node's current coordinates.  Node A subsequently
   adjusts its coordinates such that it is closer to, or further from, B
   by computing new coordinates that minimize the squared error.  A
   Vivaldi node is thus constantly adjusting its position based on a
   simulation of interconnected mass springs.  Vivaldi is now being used
   in the popular P2P application Vuze, and studies indicate that it
   scales well to very large networks [<a href="#ref-Ledlie" title='"Network Coordinates in the Wild"'>Ledlie</a>].

   Network coordinate systems require the embedding of the Internet
   topology into a coordinate system.  This is not always possible
   without errors, which impacts the accuracy of distance estimations.
   In particular, it has proved to be difficult to embed the triangular
   inequalities found in Internet path distances [<a href="#ref-Ledlie" title='"Network Coordinates in the Wild"'>Ledlie</a>].  Thus,
   Meridian [<a href="#ref-Wong" title='"Meridian: A lightweight network location service without virtual coordinates"'>Wong</a>] abandons the generality of network coordinate systems
   and provides specific distance evaluation services.  In Meridian,
   each node keeps track of a small fixed number of neighbors and
   organizes them in concentric rings, ordered by distance from the
   node.  Meridian locates the closest node by performing a multi-hop
   search where each hop exponentially reduces the distance to the
   target.  Although less general than virtual coordinates, Meridian
   incurs significantly less error for closest node discovery.

   The Ono project [<a href="#ref-Ono" title='"Northwestern University Ono Project"'>Ono</a>] takes a different approach and uses network
   measurements from Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) such as Akamai
   to find nearby peers.  Used as a plugin to the Vuze bittorrent
   client, Ono provides 31% average download rate improvement [<a href="#ref-Su" title='"Drafting behind Akamai (travelocity- based detouring)"'>Su</a>].

                                  Table 1

   Table 1 summarizes the application-level topology estimation
   techniques.  The salient performance metric is the relative error.
   While all approaches define this metric a bit differently, it can be
   generalized as how close a predicted distance comes to the
   corresponding measured distance.  A value of zero implies perfect
   prediction, and a value of 1 implies that the predicted distance is
   in error by a factor of two.  PIC, Vivaldi, and Meridian compare
   their results with that of GNP, while GNP itself compares its results
   with a precursor technique, IDMaps.  Because each of the techniques
   uses a different Internet topology and a varying number of landmarks
   and dimensions to interpret the data set, it is impossible to

   normalize the relative error across all techniques uniformly.  Thus,
   we present the relative error data in pairs, as reported in the
   literature describing the specific technique.  Readers are urged to
   compare the relative error performance in each column on its own and
   not draw any conclusions by comparing the data across columns.

   Most of the work on estimating topology information focuses on
   predicting network distance in terms of latency and does not provide
   estimates for other metrics such as throughput or packet loss rate.
   However, for many P2P applications latency is not the most important
   performance metric, and these applications could benefit from a
   richer information plane.  Sophisticated methods of active network
   probing and passive traffic monitoring are generally very powerful
   and can generate network statistics indirectly related to performance
   measures of interest, such as delay and loss rate on link-level
   granularity.  Extraction of these hidden attributes can be achieved
   by applying statistical inference techniques developed in the field
   of inferential network monitoring or network tomography subsequent to
   sampling of the network state.  Thus, network tomography enables the
   extraction of a richer set of topology information, but at the same
   time inherently increases complexity of a potential information plane
   and introduces estimation errors.  For both active and passive
   methods, statistical models for the measurement process need to be
   developed, and the spatial and temporal dependence of the
   measurements should be assessed.  Moreover, measurement methodology
   and statistical inference strategy must be considered jointly.  For a
   deeper discussion of network tomography and recent developments in
   the field, we refer the reader to [<a href="#ref-Coates" title='"Internet Tomography"'>Coates</a>].

   One system providing such a service is iPlane [<a href="#ref-Madhyastha" title='"iPlane: an information plane for distributed services"'>Madhyastha</a>], which
   aims at creating an annotated atlas of the Internet that contains
   information about latency, bandwidth, capacity, and loss rate.  To
   determine features of the Internet topology, iPlane bridges and
   builds upon different ideas, such as active probing based on packet
   dispersion techniques to infer available bandwidth along path
   segments.  These ideas are drawn from different fields, including
   network measurement as described by Dovrolis et al. in [<a href="#ref-Dovrolis" title='"What do packet dispersion techniques measure?"'>Dovrolis</a>] and
   network tomography [<a href="#ref-Coates" title='"Internet Tomography"'>Coates</a>].

   Instead of estimating topology information on the application level
   through distributed measurements, this information could be provided
   by the entities running the physical networks -- usually ISPs or
   network operators.  In fact, they have full knowledge of the topology
   of the networks they administer and, in order to avoid congestion on
   critical links, are interested in helping applications to optimize
   the traffic they generate.  The remainder of this section briefly

   describes three recently proposed solutions that follow such an
   approach to address the ALTO problem.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.1.%20%20P4P%20Architecture"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.1" name="section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  P4P Architecture</span>

   The architecture proposed by Xie et al. [<a href="#ref-Xie" title='"P4P: Explicit Communications for Cooperative Control Between P2P and Network Providers"'>Xie</a>] has been adopted by the
   Distributed Computing Industry Association (DCIA) P4P working group
   [<a href="#ref-P4P" title='"DCIA P4P Working group"'>P4P</a>], an open group established by ISPs, P2P software distributors,
   and technology researchers, with the dual goal of defining mechanisms
   to (1) accelerate content distribution and (2) optimize utilization
   of network resources.

   The main role in the P4P architecture is played by servers called
   "iTrackers", deployed by network providers and accessed by P2P
   applications (or, in general, by elements of the P2P system) in order
   to make optimal decisions when selecting a peer to which the element
   will connect.  An iTracker may offer three interfaces:

   1.  Info: Allows P2P elements (e.g., peers or trackers) to get opaque
       information associated to an IP address.  Such information is
       kept opaque to hide the actual network topology, but can be used
       to compute the network distance between IP addresses.

   2.  Policy: Allows P2P elements to obtain policies and guidelines of
       the network, which specify how a network provider would like its
       networks to be utilized at a high level, regardless of P2P
       applications.

   3.  Capability: Allows P2P elements to request network providers'
       capabilities.

   The P4P architecture is under evaluation with simulations,
   experiments on the PlanetLab distributed testbed, and in field tests
   with real users.  Initial simulations and PlanetLab experiment
   results [<a href="#ref-P4P" title='"DCIA P4P Working group"'>P4P</a>] indicate that improvements in BitTorrent download
   completion time and link utilization in the range of 50-70% are
   possible.  Results observed on Comcast's network during a field test
   trial conducted with a modified version of the software used by the
   Pando content delivery network (documented in <a href="rfc5632.html">RFC 5632</a> [<a href="rfc5632.html" title="&quot;Comcast's ISP Experiences in a Proactive Network Provider Participation for P2P (P4P) Technical Trial&quot;">RFC5632</a>])
   show average improvements in download rate in different scenarios
   varying between 57% and 85%, and a 34% to 80% drop in the cross-
   domain traffic generated by such an application.

   In the general solution proposed by Aggarwal et al. [<a href="#ref-Aggarwal" title='"Can ISPs and P2P users cooperate for improved performance?"'>Aggarwal</a>],
   network providers offer host servers, called "oracles", that help P2P
   users choose optimal neighbors.

   The oracle concept uses the following mechanism: a P2P client sends
   the list of potential peers to the oracle hosted by its ISP and
   receives a re-arranged peer list, ordered according to the ISP's
   local routing policies and preferences.  For instance, to keep the
   traffic local, the ISP may prefer peers within its network, or it may
   pick links with higher bandwidth or peers that are geographically
   closer to improve application performance.  Once the client has
   obtained this ordered list, it has enough information to perform
   better-than-random initial peer selection.

   Such a solution has been evaluated with simulations and experiments
   run on the PlanetLab testbed, and the results show both improvements
   in content download time and a reduction of overall P2P traffic, even
   when only a subset of the applications actually query the oracle to
   make their decisions.

   The solution proposed by Saucez et al. [<a href="#ref-Saucez" title='"Implementation and Preliminary Evaluation of an ISP- Driven Informed Path Selection"'>Saucez</a>] is essentially a
   modified version of the oracle-based approach described in
   <a href="#section-2.2.2">Section 2.2.2</a>, intended to provide a network-layer service for
   finding the best source and destination addresses when establishing a
   connection between two endpoints in multi-homed environments (which
   are common in IPv6 networking).  Peer selection optimization in P2P
   systems -- the ALTO problem in today's Internet -- can be addressed
   by the IDIPS solution as a specific sub-case where the options for
   the destination address consist of all the peers sharing a desired
   resource, while the choice of the source address is fixed.  An
   evaluation performed on IDIPS shows that costs for both providing and
   accessing the service are negligible.

   The application-level techniques described in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a> provide
   tools for peer-to-peer applications to estimate parameters of the
   underlying network topology.  Although these techniques can improve
   application performance, there are limitations of what can be
   achieved by operating only on the application level.

   Topology estimation techniques use abstractions of the network
   topology, which often hide features that would be of interest to the
   application.  Network coordinate systems, for example, are unable to
   detect overlay paths shorter than the direct path in the Internet
   topology.  However, these paths frequently exist in the Internet
   [<a href="#ref-Wang" title='"Towards Network Triangle Inequality Violation Aware Distributed Systems"'>Wang</a>].  Similarly, application-level techniques may not accurately
   estimate topologies with multipath routing.

   When using network coordinates to estimate topology information, the
   underlying assumption is that distance in terms of latency determines
   performance.  However, for file sharing and content distribution
   applications, there is more to performance than just the network
   latency between nodes.  The utility of a long-lived data transfer is
   determined by the throughput of the underlying TCP protocol, which
   depends on the round-trip time as well as the loss rate experienced
   on the corresponding path [<a href="#ref-Padhye" title='"Modeling TCP throughput: A simple model and its empirical validation"'>Padhye</a>].  Hence, these applications
   benefit from a richer set of topology information that goes beyond
   latency, including loss rate, capacity, and available bandwidth.

   Some of the topology estimation techniques used by P2P applications
   need time to converge to a result.  For example, current BitTorrent
   clients implement local, passive traffic measurements and a tit-for-
   tat bandwidth reciprocity mechanism to optimize peer selection at a
   local level.  Peers eventually settle on a set of neighbors that
   maximizes their download rate, but because peers cannot reason about
   the value of neighbors without actively exchanging data with them,
   and because the number of concurrent data transfers is limited
   (typically to 5-7), convergence is delayed and easily can be
   sub-optimal.

   Skype's P2P Voice over IP (VoIP) application chooses a relay node in
   cases where two peers are behind NATs and cannot connect directly.
   Measurements taken by Ren et al. [<a href="#ref-Ren" title='"ASAP: An AS-aware peer-relay protocol for high quality VoIP"'>Ren</a>] showed that the relay
   selection mechanism of Skype (1) is not able to discover the best
   possible relay nodes in terms of minimum RTT, (2) requires a long
   setup and stabilization time, which degrades the end user experience,
   and (3) is creating a non-negligible amount of overhead traffic due
   to probing a large number of nodes.  They further showed that the
   quality of the relay paths could be improved when the underlying
   network Autonomous System (AS) topology is considered.

   Some features of the network topology are hard to infer through
   application-level techniques, and it may not be possible to infer
   them at all, e.g., service-provider policies and preferences such as
   the state and cost associated with interdomain peering and transit
   links.  Another example is the traffic engineering policy of a
   service provider, which may counteract the routing objective of the
   overlay network, leading to a poor overall performance [<a href="#ref-Seetharaman" title='"Preemptive Strategies to Improve Routing Performance of Native and Overlay Layers"'>Seetharaman</a>].

   Finally, application-level techniques often require applications to
   perform measurements on the topology.  These measurements create
   traffic overhead, in particular, if measurements are performed
   individually by all applications interested in estimating topology.

   Beyond a significant amount of research work on the topic, we believe
   that there are sizable open issues to address in an infrastructure-
   based approach to traffic optimization.  The following is not an
   exhaustive list, but a representative sample of the pertinent issues.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Coordinate%20Estimation%20or%20Path%20Latencies%3F"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Coordinate Estimation or Path Latencies?</span>

   Despite the many solutions that have been proposed for providing
   applications with topology information in a fully distributed manner,
   there is currently an ongoing debate in the research community
   whether such solutions should focus on estimating nodes' coordinates
   or path latencies.  Such a debate has recently been fed by studies
   showing that the triangle inequality on which coordinate systems are
   based is often proved false in the Internet [<a href="#ref-Ledlie" title='"Network Coordinates in the Wild"'>Ledlie</a>].  Proposed
   systems following both approaches -- in particular, Vivaldi [<a href="#ref-Dabek" title='"Vivaldi: A Decentralized Network Coordinate System"'>Dabek</a>]
   and PIC [<a href="#ref-Costa" title='"PIC: Practical Internet coordinates for distance estimation"'>Costa</a>] following the former, and Meridian [<a href="#ref-Wong" title='"Meridian: A lightweight network location service without virtual coordinates"'>Wong</a>] and iPlane
   [<a href="#ref-Madhyastha" title='"iPlane: an information plane for distributed services"'>Madhyastha</a>] the latter -- have been simulated, implemented, and
   studied in real-world trials, each one showing different points of
   strength and weaknesses.  Concentrated work will be needed to
   determine which of the two solutions will be conducive to the ALTO
   problem.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Malicious%20Nodes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Malicious Nodes</span>

   Another open issue common in most distributed environments consisting
   of a large number of peers is the resistance against malicious nodes.
   Security mechanisms to identify misbehavior are based on triangle
   inequality checks [<a href="#ref-Costa" title='"PIC: Practical Internet coordinates for distance estimation"'>Costa</a>], which, however, tend to fail and thus
   return false positives in the presence of measurement inaccuracies
   induced, for example, by traffic fluctuations that occur quite often
   in large networks [<a href="#ref-Ledlie" title='"Network Coordinates in the Wild"'>Ledlie</a>].  Beyond the issue of using triangle
   inequality checks, authoritatively authenticating the identity of an
   oracle, and preventing an oracle from attacks are also important.
   Existing techniques -- such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
   [<a href="rfc5280.html" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5280</a>] or identity-based encryption [<a href="#ref-Boneh" title='"Identity-Based Encryption from the Weil Pairing"'>Boneh</a>] for authenticating the
   identity and the use of secure multi-party computation techniques to
   prevent an oracle from collusion attacks -- need to be explored and
   studied for judicious use in ALTO-type solutions.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20Information%20Integrity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Information Integrity</span>

   Similarly, even in controlled architectures deployed by network
   operators where system elements may be authenticated [<a href="#ref-Xie" title='"P4P: Explicit Communications for Cooperative Control Between P2P and Network Providers"'>Xie</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-Aggarwal" title='"Can ISPs and P2P users cooperate for improved performance?"'>Aggarwal</a>],[<a href="#ref-Saucez" title='"Implementation and Preliminary Evaluation of an ISP- Driven Informed Path Selection"'>Saucez</a>], it is still possible that the information
   returned to applications is deliberately altered, for example,
   assigning higher priority to financially inexpensive links instead of

   neutrally applying proximity criteria.  What are the effects of such
   deliberate alterations if multiple peers collude to determine a
   different route to the target, one that is not provided by an oracle?
   Similarly, what are the consequences if an oracle targets a
   particular node in another AS by redirecting an inordinate number of
   querying peers to it causing, essentially, a Distributed Denial-of-
   Service (DDoS) [<a href="rfc4732.html" title='"Internet Denial-of-Service Considerations"'>RFC4732</a>] attack on the node?  Furthermore, does an
   oracle broadcast or multicast a response to a query?  If so,
   techniques to protect the confidentiality of the multicast stream
   will need to be investigated to thwart "free riding" peers.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20Richness%20of%20Topological%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Richness of Topological Information</span>

   Many systems already use RTT to account for delay when establishing
   connections with peers (e.g., Content-Addressable Network (CAN)
   [<a href="#ref-Ratnasamy" title='"A Scalable Content-Addressable Network"'>Ratnasamy</a>], Bamboo [<a href="#ref-Rhea" title='"OpenDHT: a public DHT service and its uses"'>Rhea</a>]).  An operator can provide not only the
   delay metric but other metrics that the peer cannot figure out on its
   own.  These metrics may include the characteristics of the access
   links to other peers, bandwidth available to peers (based on
   operators' engineering of the network), network policies, preferences
   such as state and cost associated with intradomain peering links, and
   so on.  Exactly what kinds of metrics an operator can provide to
   stabilize the network throughput will also need to be investigated.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.5.%20%20Hybrid%20Solutions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.5" name="section-4.5">4.5</a>.  Hybrid Solutions</span>

   It is conceivable that P2P users may not be comfortable with operator
   intervention to provide topology information.  To eliminate this
   intervention, alternative schemes to estimate topological distance
   can be used.  For instance, Ono uses client redirections generated by
   Akamai CDN servers as an approximation for estimating distance to
   peers; Vivaldi, GNP, and PIC use synthetic coordinate systems.  A
   neutral third party can make available a hybrid layer-cooperation
   service -- without the active participation of the ISP -- that uses
   alternative techniques discussed in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a> to create a
   topological map.  This map can be subsequently used by a subset of
   users who may not trust the ISP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.6.%20%20Negative%20Impact%20of%20Over-Localization"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.6" name="section-4.6">4.6</a>.  Negative Impact of Over-Localization</span>

   The literature presented in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> shows that a certain level of
   locality-awareness in the peer selection process of P2P algorithms is
   usually beneficial to application performance.  However, an excessive
   localization of the traffic might cause partitioning in the overlay
   interconnecting these peers, which will negatively affect the
   performance experienced by the peers themselves.

   Finding the right balance between localization and randomness in peer
   selection is an open issue.  At the time of writing, it seems that
   different applications have different levels of tolerance and should
   be addressed separately.  Le Blond et al. [<a href="#ref-LeBlond" title='"Pushing BitTorrent Locality to the Limit"'>LeBlond</a>] have studied the
   specific case of BitTorrent, proposing a simple mechanism to prevent
   partitioning in the overlay, yet reach a high level of cross-domain
   traffic reduction without adversely impacting peers.

   This document is a survey of existing literature on topology
   estimation.  As such, it does not introduce any new security
   considerations to be taken into account beyond what is already
   discussed in each paper surveyed.

   Insofar as topology estimation is used to provide a solution to the
   ALTO problem, the issues in Sections <a href="#section-4.2">4.2</a> and <a href="#section-4.3">4.3</a> deserve special
   attention.  There are efforts underway in the IETF ALTO working group
   to design a protocol that protects the privacy of the peer-to-peer
   users as well as the service providers.  [<a href="#ref-Chen" title='"Overview for ALTO Security Issues"'>Chen</a>] provides an overview
   of ALTO security issues, Section 11 of [<a href="#ref-Alimi" title='"ALTO Protocol"'>Alimi</a>] is an exhaustive
   overview of ALTO security, and <a href="rfc5693.html#section-6">Section 6 of RFC 5693</a> [<a href="rfc5693.html" title='"Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Problem Statement"'>RFC5693</a>] also
   lists the privacy and confidentiality aspects of an ALTO solution.
