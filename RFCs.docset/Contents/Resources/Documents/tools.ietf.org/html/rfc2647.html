<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   This document defines terms used in measuring the performance of
   firewalls. It extends the terminology already used for benchmarking
   routers and switches with definitions specific to firewalls.

   Forwarding rate and connection-oriented measurements are the primary
   metrics used in this document.

   Why do we need firewall performance measurements? First, despite the
   rapid rise in firewall deployment, there is no standard method of
   performance measurement. Second, implementations vary widely, making
   it difficult to do direct performance comparisons. Finally, more and
   more organizations are deploying firewalls on internal networks
   operating at relatively high speeds, while most firewall
   implementations remain optimized for use over relatively low-speed
   wide-area connections. As a result, users are often unsure whether
   the products they buy will stand up to relatively heavy loads.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Existing%20definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Existing definitions</span>

   This document uses the conceptual framework established in RFCs 1242
   and 2544 (for routers) and <a href="rfc2285.html">RFC 2285</a> (for switches). The router and
   switch documents contain discussions of several terms relevant to
   benchmarking the performance of firewalls. Readers should consult the
   router and switch documents before making use of this document.

   This document uses the definition format described in <a href="rfc1242.html#section-2">RFC 1242,
   Section 2</a>. The sections in each definition are: definition,
   discussion, measurement units (optional), issues (optional), and
   cross-references.

   Definition:
     Packets forwarded as a result of the rule set of the device under
     test/system under test (DUT/SUT).

   Discussion:
     Firewalls typically are configured to forward only those packets
     explicitly permitted in the rule set. Forwarded packets must be
     included in calculating the bit forwarding rate or maximum bit
     forwarding rate of the DUT/SUT. All other packets must not be
     included in bit forwarding rate calculations.

     This document assumes 1:1 correspondence of allowed traffic offered
     to the DUT/SUT and forwarded by the DUT/SUT. There are cases where
     the DUT/SUT may forward more traffic than it is offered; for
     example, the DUT/SUT may act as a mail exploder or a multicast
     server. Any attempt to benchmark forwarding rates of such traffic
     must include a description of how much traffic the tester expects
     to be forwarded.

   Definition:
     A proxy service that is set up and torn down in response to a
     client request, rather than existing on a static basis.

   Discussion:
     Circuit proxies always forward packets containing a given port
     number if that port number is permitted by the rule set.
     Application proxies, in contrast, forward packets only once a
     connection has been established using some known protocol. When the
     connection closes, a firewall using applicaton proxies rejects
     individual packets, even if they contain port numbers allowed by a
     rule set.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3%20Authentication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a> Authentication</span>

   Definition:
     The process of verifying that a user requesting a network resource
     is who he, she, or it claims to be, and vice versa.

   Discussion:
     Trust is a critical concept in network security. Any network
     resource (such as a file server or printer) typically requires
     authentication before granting access.

     Authentication takes many forms, including but not limited to IP
     addresses; TCP or UDP port numbers; passwords; external token
     authentication cards; and biometric identification such as
     signature, speech, or retina recognition systems.

     The entity being authenticated might be the client machine (for
     example, by proving that a given IP source address really is that
     address, and not a rogue machine spoofing that address) or a user
     (by proving that the user really is who he, she, or it claims to
     be).  Servers might also authenticate themselves to clients.

     Testers should be aware that in an increasingly mobile society,
     authentication based on machine-specific criteria such as an IP
     address or port number is not equivalent to verifying that a given
     individual is making an access request. At this writing systems
     that verify the identity of users are typically external to the
     firewall, and may introduce additional latency to the overall SUT.

   Definition:
     The number of bits per second of allowed traffic a DUT/SUT can be
     observed to transmit to the correct destination interface(s) in
     response to a specified offered load.

   Discussion:
     This definition differs substantially from <a href="rfc1242.html#section-3.17">section 3.17 of RFC 1242</a>
     and <a href="rfc2285.html#section-3.6.1">section 3.6.1 of RFC 2285</a>.

     Unlike both RFCs 1242 and 2285, this definition introduces the
     notion of different classes of traffic: allowed, illegal, and
     rejected (see definitions for each term). For benchmarking
     purposes, it is assumed that bit forwarding rate measurements
     include only allowed traffic.

     Unlike <a href="rfc1242.html">RFC 1242</a>, there is no reference to lost or retransmitted
     data.  Forwarding rate is assumed to be a goodput measurement, in
     that only data successfully forwarded to the destination interface
     is measured.  Bit forwarding rate must be measured in relation to
     the offered load.  Bit forwarding rate may be measured with
     differed load levels, traffic orientation, and traffic
     distribution.

     Unlike <a href="rfc2285.html">RFC 2285</a>, this measurement counts bits per second rather
     than frames per second. Testers interested in frame (or frame-like)
     measurements should use units of transfer.

   Definition:
     A proxy service that statically defines which traffic will be

   Discussion:
     The key difference between application and circuit proxies is that
     the latter are static and thus will always set up a connection if
     the DUT/SUT's rule set allows it. For example, if a firewall's rule
     set permits ftp connections, a circuit proxy will always forward
     traffic on TCP port 20 (ftp-data) even if no control connection was
     first established on TCP port 21 (ftp-control).

   Definition:
     The aggregate number of simultaneous connections between hosts
     across the DUT/SUT, or between hosts and the DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:
     The number of concurrent connections a firewall can support is just
     as important a metric for some users as maximum bit forwarding
     rate.

     While "connection" describes only a state and not necessarily the
     transfer of data, concurrency assumes that all existing connections
     are in fact capable of transferring data. If a data cannot be sent
     over a connection, that connection should not be counted toward the
     number of concurrent connections.

     Further, this definition assumes that the ability (or lack thereof)
     to transfer data on a given connection is solely the responsibility
     of the DUT/SUT. For example, a TCP connection that a DUT/SUT has

     another connection that has temporarily stopped transferring data
     because some external device has restricted the flow of data is not

   Definition:
     A state in which two hosts, or a host and the DUT/SUT, agree to
     exchange data using a known protocol.

   Discussion:
     A connection is an abstraction describing an agreement between two
     nodes: One agrees to send data and the other agrees to receive it.

     Connections might use TCP, but they don't have to. Other protocols
     such as ATM also might be used, either instead of or in addition to
     TCP connections.

     What constitutes a connection depends on the application. For a
     native ATM application, connections and virtual circuits may be
     synonymous. For TCP/IP applications on ATM networks (where multiple
     TCP connections may ride over a single ATM virtual circuit), the
     number of TCP connections may be the most important consideration.

     Additionally, in some cases firewalls may handle a mixture of
     native TCP and native ATM connections. In this situation, the
     wrappers around user data will differ. The most meaningful metric
     describes what an end-user will see.

     Data connections describe state, not data transfer. The existence
     of a connection does not imply that data travels on that connection
     at any given time, although if data cannot be forwarded on a
     previously established connection that connection should not be
     considered in any aggregrate connection count (see concurrent
     connections).

     A firewall's architecture dictates where a connection terminates.
     In the case of application or circuit proxy firewalls, a connection
     terminates at the DUT/SUT. But firewalls using packet filtering or
     stateful packet filtering designs act only as passthrough devices,
     in that they reside between two connection endpoints. Regardless of
     firewall architecture, the number of data connections is still
     relevant, since all firewalls perform some form of connection
     maintenance; at the  very least, all check connection requests
     against their rule sets.

     Further, note that connection is not an atomic unit of measurement
     in that it does not describe the various steps involved in
     connection setup, maintenance, and teardown. Testers may wish to
     take separate measurements of each of these components.

     When benchmarking firewall performance, it's important to identify
     the connection establishment and teardown procedures, as these must
     not be included when measuring steady-state forwarding rates.
     Further, forwarding rates must be measured only after any security
     associations have been established.

     Though it seems paradoxical, connectionless protocols such as UDP
     may also involve connections, at least for the purposes of firewall
     performance measurement. For example, one host may send UDP packets
     to another across a firewall. If the destination host is listening
     on the correct UDP port, it receives the UDP packets. For the
     purposes of firewall performance measurement, this is considered a
     connection.

   Definition:
     The data exchanged between hosts, or between a host and the

   Discussion:
     Some implementations of TCP and other connection-oriented protocols
     use "keep-alive" data to maintain a connection during periods where
     no user data is exchanged.

     When benchmarking firewall performance, it is useful to identfy
     connection maintenance traffic as distinct from UOTs per second.
     Given that maintenance traffic may be characterized by short bursts
     at periodical intervals, it may not be possible to describe a
     steady-state forwarding rate for maintenance traffic. One possible
     approach is to identify the quantity of maintenance traffic, in
     bytes or bits, over a given interval, and divide through to derive
     a measurement of maintenance traffic forwarding rate.

   Definition:
     A device or group of devices that enforces an access control policy
     between networks.

   Discussion:
     While there are many different ways to accomplish it, all firewalls
     do the same thing: control access between networks.

     The most common configuration involves a firewall connecting two
     segments (one protected and one unprotected), but this is not the
     only possible configuration. Many firewalls support tri-homing,
     allowing use of a DMZ network. It is possible for a firewall to
     accommodate more than three interfaces, each attached to a
     different network segment.

     The criteria by which access are controlled are not specified here.
     Typically this has been done using network- or transport-layer
     criteria (such as IP subnet or TCP port number), but there is no

     The number of bits per unit of time forwarded to the correct

   Discussion:
     Firewalls are generally insensitive to packet loss in the network.
     As such, measurements of gross bit forwarding rates are not
     meaningful since (in the case of proxy-based and stateful packet
     filtering firewalls) a receiving endpoint directly attached to a
     DUT/SUT would not receive any data dropped by the DUT/SUT.

     The type of traffic lost or retransmitted is protocol-dependent.
     TCP and ATM, for example, request different types  of
     retransmissions.  Testers must observe retransmitted data for the
     protocol in use, and subtract this quantity from measurements of

   Definition:
     The number of logical interfaces a DUT/SUT contains.

   Discussion:
     Firewalls typically contain at least two logical interfaces. In
     network topologies where a DMZ is used, the firewall usually
     contains at least three interfaces and is said to be tri-homed.
     Additional interfaces would make a firewall quad-homed, quint-

     It is theoretically possible for a firewall to contain one physical
     interface and multiple logical interfaces. This configuration is
     discouraged for testing purposes because of the difficulty in
     verifying that no leakage occurs between protected and unprotected
     segments.

     Packets specified for rejection in the rule set of the DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:
     A buggy or misconfigured firewall might forward packets even though
     its rule set specifies that these packets be dropped. Illegal
     traffic differs from rejected traffic in that it describes all
     traffic specified for rejection by the rule set, while rejected
     traffic specifies only those packets actually dropped by the

   Definition:
     The recording of user requests made to the firewall.

   Discussion:
     Firewalls typically log all requests they handle, both allowed and
     rejected. For many firewall designs, logging requires a significant
     amount of processing overhead, especially when complex rule sets
     are in use.

     The type and amount of data logged varies by implementation.
     Testers may find it desirable to log equivalent data when comparing
     different DUT/SUTs.

     Some systems allow logging to take place on systems other than the
     DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:
     In the interest of conserving the IPv4 address space, <a href="rfc1918.html">RFC 1918</a>
     proposed the use of certain private (reserved) blocks of IP
     addresses. Connections to public networks are made by use of a
     device that translates one or more <a href="rfc1918.html">RFC 1918</a> addresses to one or

   Discussion:
     Security policies generally do not spell out specific
     configurations for firewalls; rather, they set general guidelines
     for what is and is not acceptable network access.

     The actual mechanism for controlling access is usually the rule set

   Definition:
     A network segment or segments to which access is controlled by the
     DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:
     Firewalls are intended to prevent unauthorized access either to or
     from the protected network. Depending on the configuration
     specified by the policy and rule set, the DUT/SUT may allow hosts
     on the protected segment to act as clients for servers on either
     the DMZ or the unprotected network, or both.

     Protected networks are often called "internal networks." That term
     is not used here because firewalls increasingly are deployed within
     an organization, where all segments are by definition internal.

   Discussion:
     Proxy-based firewalls do not allow direct connections between
     hosts.  Instead, two connections are established: one between the
     client host and the DUT/SUT, and another between the DUT/SUT and
     server host.

     As with packet-filtering firewalls, proxy-based devices use a rule
     set to determine which traffic should be forwarded and which should
     be rejected.

     There are two types of proxies: application proxies and circuit
     proxies.

   Definition:
     The collection of access control rules that determines which
     packets the DUT/SUT will forward and which it will reject.

   Discussion:
     Rule sets control access to and from the network interfaces of the

     DUT/SUT. By definition, rule sets do not apply equally to all
     network interfaces; otherwise there would be no need for the
     firewall. For benchmarking purposes, a specific rule set is
     typically applied to each network interface in the DUT/SUT.

     The tester must describe the complete contents of the rule set of
     each DUT/SUT.

     To ensure measurements reflect only traffic forwarded by the
     DUT/SUT, testers are encouraged to include a rule denying all
     access except for those packets allowed by the rule set.

     The process of forwarding or rejecting traffic based on the

     Packet filtering and proxy firewalls are essentially static, in
     that they always forward or reject packets based on the contents of
     the rule set.

     In contrast, devices using stateful packet filtering will only
     forward packets if they correspond with state information
     maintained by the device about each connection. For example, a
     stateful packet filtering device will reject a packet on port 20
     (ftp-data) if no connection has been established over the ftp
     control port (usually port 21).

   Definition:
     A firewall with three network interfaces.

   Discussion:
     Tri-homed firewalls connect three network segments with different
     network addresses. Typically, these would be protected, DMZ, and
     unprotected segments.

     A tri-homed firewall may offer some security advantages over
     firewalls with two interfaces. An attacker on an unprotected
     network may compromise hosts on the DMZ but still not reach any
     hosts on the protected network.

     Usually the differentiator between one segment and another is its

   Definition:
     A discrete collection of bytes comprising at least one header and
     optional user data.

   Discussion:
     This metric is intended for use in describing steady-state
     forwarding rate of the DUT/SUT.

     The unit of transfer (UOT) definition is deliberately left open to
     interpretation, allowing the broadest possible application.
     Examples of UOTs include TCP segments, IP packets, Ethernet frames,
     and ATM cells.

     While the definition is deliberately broad, its interpretation must
     not be. The tester must describe what type of UOT will be offered
     to the DUT/SUT, and must offer these UOTs at a consistent rate.
     Traffic measurement must begin after all connection establishment
     routines complete and before any connection completion routine
     begins.  Further, measurements must begin after any security
     associations (SAs) are established and before any SA is revoked.

     Testers also must compare only like UOTs. It is not appropriate,
     for example, to compare forwarding rates by offering 1,500-byte

     Firewalls are deployed between protected and unprotected segments.
     The unprotected network is not protected by the DUT/SUT.

     Note that a DUT/SUT's policy may specify hosts on an unprotected

     permitted to access an FTP server on an unprotected network. But

   Discussion:
     "User" is a problematic term in the context of firewall performance
     testing, for several reasons. First, a user may in fact be a
     process or processes requesting services through the DUT/SUT.
     Second, different "user" requests may require radically different
     amounts of DUT/SUT resources. Third, traffic profiles vary widely
     from one organization to another, making it difficult to
     characterize the load offered by a typical user.

     For these reasons, testers should not attempt to measure DUT/SUT
     performance in terms of users supported. Instead, testers should
     describe performance in terms of maximum bit forwarding rate and
     maximum number of connections sustained. Further, testers should
     use the term "data source" rather than user to describe traffic
     generator(s).

   The primary goal of this memo is to describe terms used in
   benchmarking firewall performance. However, readers should be aware
   that there is some overlap between performance and security issues.
   Specifically, the optimal configuration for firewall performance may
   not be the most secure, and vice-versa.

   Further, certain forms of attack may degrade performance. One common
   form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack bombards a firewall with so
   much rejected traffic that it cannot forward allowed traffic. DoS
   attacks do not always involve heavy loads; by definition, DoS
   describes any state in which a firewall is offered rejected traffic
   that prohibits it from forwarding some or all allowed traffic. Even a
   small amount of traffic may significantly degrade firewall
   performance, or stop the firewall altogether. Further, the safeguards
   in firewalls to guard against such attacks may have a significant
   negative impact on performance.

   Since the library of attacks is constantly expanding, no attempt is
   made here to define specific attacks that may affect performance.
   Nonetheless, any reasonable performance benchmark should take into

   safeguards should be in place when comparing performance of different
