IESG Note

   This MIB module uses an unconventional scheme for modeling management
   information (on top of the SNMP model) which is unique to this MIB.
   The IESG recommends against using this document as an example for the
   design of future MIBs.

   The "Printer Working Group" industry consortium is not an IETF
   working group, and the IETF does not recognize the Printer Working
   Group as a standards-setting body.  This document is being published
   solely to provide information to the Internet community regarding a
   MIB that might be deployed in the marketplace. Publication of this
   document as an RFC is not an endorsement of this MIB.

Abstract

   This document provides a printer industry standard SNMP MIB for (1)
   monitoring the status and progress of print jobs (2) obtaining
   resource requirements before a job is processed, (3) monitoring
   resource consumption while a job is being processed and (4)
   collecting resource accounting data after the completion of a job.
   This MIB is intended to be implemented (1) in a printer or (2) in a
   server that supports one or more printers.  Use of the object set is
   not limited to printing.  However, support for services other than
   printing is outside the scope of this Job Monitoring MIB.  Future

   This specification defines an official Printer Working Group (PWG)
   [PWG] standard SNMP MIB for the monitoring of jobs on network
   printers.  This specification is being published as an IETF
   Information Document for the convenience of the Internet community.
   In consultation with the IETF Application Area Directors, it was
   concluded that this MIB specification properly belongs as an
   Information document, because this MIB monitors a service node on the
   network, rather than a network node proper.

   The Job Monitoring MIB is intended to be implemented by an agent
   within a printer or the first server closest to the printer, where
   the printer is either directly connected to the server only or the
   printer does not contain the job monitoring MIB agent.  It is
   recommended that implementations place the SNMP agent as close as
   possible to the processing of the print job.  This MIB applies to
   printers with and without spooling capabilities.  This MIB is
   designed to be compatible with most current commonly-used job
   submission protocols.  In most environments that support high
   function job submission/job control protocols, like ISO DPA [iso-
   dpa], those protocols would be used to monitor and manage print jobs
   rather than using the Job Monitoring MIB.

   The Job Monitoring MIB consists of a General Group, a Job Submission
   ID Group, a Job Group, and an Attribute Group.  Each group is a
   table.  All accessible objects are read-only.  The General Group
   contains general information that applies to all jobs in a job set.
   The Job Submission ID table maps the job submission ID that the
   client uses to identify a job to the jmJobIndex that the Job
   Monitoring Agent uses to identify jobs in the Job and Attribute
   tables.  The Job table contains the MANDATORY integer job state and
   status objects.  The Attribute table consists of multiple entries per
   job that specify (1) job and document identification and parameters,
   (2) requested resources, and (3) consumed resources during and after
   job processing/printing.  A larger number of job attributes are
   defined as textual conventions that an agent SHALL return if the
   server or device implements the functionality so represented and the
   agent has access to the information.

   The job MIB is intended to provide the following information for the
   indicated Role Models in the Printer MIB [<a href="#ref-print-mib" title='"Printer MIB"'>print-mib</a>] (Appendix D -
   Roles of Users).

      User:

         Provide the ability to identify the least busy printer.  The
         user will be able to determine the number and size of jobs
         waiting for each printer.  No attempt is made to actually
         predict the length of time that jobs will take.

         Provide the ability to identify the current status of the
         user's job (user queries).

         Provide a timely indication that the job has completed and
         where it can be found.

         Provide error and diagnostic information for jobs that did not
         successfully complete.

      Operator:

         Provide a presentation of the state of all the jobs in the
         print system.

         Provide the ability to identify the user that submitted the
         print job.

         Provide the ability to identify the resources required by each
         job.

         Provide the ability to define which physical printers are
         candidates for the print job.

         Provide some idea of how long each job will take.  However,
         exact estimates of time to process a job is not being
         attempted.  Instead, objects are included that allow the
         operator to be able to make gross estimates.

      Capacity Planner:

         Provide the ability to determine printer utilization as a
         function of time.

         Provide the ability to determine how long jobs wait before
         starting to print.

      Accountant:

         Provide information to allow the creation of a record of
         resources consumed and printer usage data for charging users or
         groups for resources consumed.

         Provide information to allow the prediction of consumable usage
         and resource need.

   The MIB supports printers that can contain more than one job at a
   time, but still be usable for low end printers that only contain a
   single job at a time.  In particular, the MIB supports the needs of
   Windows and other PC environments for managing low-end direct-connect
   (serial or parallel) and networked devices without unnecessary
   overhead or complexity, while also providing for higher end systems
   and devices.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2%20Types%20of%20Job%20Monitoring%20Applications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a> Types of Job Monitoring Applications</span>

   The Job Monitoring MIB is designed for the following types of
   monitoring applications:

        1. Monitor a single job starting when the job is submitted and
           ending a defined period after the job completes.  The Job
           Submission ID table provides the map to find the specific job
           to be monitored.

        2. Monitor all 'active' jobs in a queue, which this
           specification generalizes to a "job set".  End users may use
           such a program when selecting a least busy printer, so the
           MIB is designed for such a program to start up quickly and
           find the information needed quickly without having to read



<span class="grey">Bergman, et al.              Informational                      [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-7" id="page-7" name="page-7"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2707.html">RFC 2707</a>               Job Monitoring MIB - V1.0           November 1999</span>


           all (completed) jobs in order to find the active jobs.
           System operators may also use such a program, in which case
           it would be running for a long period of time and may also be
           interested in the jobs that have completed.  Finally such a
           program may be used to provide an enhanced console and
           logging capability.

        3. Collect resource usage for accounting or system utilization
           purposes that copy the completed job statistics to an
           accounting system. It is recognized that depending on
           accounting programs to copy MIB data during the job-retention
           period is somewhat unreliable, since the accounting program
           may not be running (or may have crashed).  Such a program is
           also expected to keep a shadow copy of the entire Job
           Attribute table including completed, canceled, and aborted
           jobs which the program updates on each polling cycle.  Such a
           program polls at the rate of the persistence of the Attribute
           table.  The design is not optimized to help such an
           application determine which jobs are completed, canceled, or
           aborted.  Instead, the application SHOULD query each job that
           the application's shadow copy shows was not complete,
           canceled, or aborted at the previous poll cycle to see if it
           is now complete or canceled, plus any new jobs that have been
           submitted.

   The MIB provides a set of objects that represent a compatible subset
   of job and document attributes of the ISO DPA standard [<a href="#ref-iso-dpa">iso-dpa</a>] and
   the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) [<a href="#ref-ipp-model" title='"The Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>ipp-model</a>], so that coherence
   is maintained between these two protocols and the information
   presented to end users and system operators by monitoring
   applications.  However, the job monitoring MIB is intended to be used
   with printers that implement other job submitting and management
   protocols, such as IEEE 1284.1 (TIPSI) [<a href="#ref-tipsi">tipsi</a>], as well as with ones
   that do implement ISO DPA.  Thus the job monitoring MIB does not
   require implementation of either the ISO DPA or IPP protocols.

   The MIB is designed so that an additional MIB(s) can be specified in
   the future for monitoring multi-function (scan, FAX, copy) jobs as an
   augmentation to this MIB.

   This section defines the terms that are used in this specification
   and the general model for jobs in alphabetical order.

      NOTE - Existing systems use conflicting terms, so these terms are
      drawn from the ISO 10175 Document Printing Application (DPA)
      standard [<a href="#ref-iso-dpa">iso-dpa</a>].  For example, PostScript systems use the term
      session for what is called a job in this specification and the
      term job to mean what is called a document in this specification.

   Accounting Application:  The SNMP management application that copies
   job information to some more permanent medium so that another
   application can perform accounting on the data for Accountants, Asset
   Managers, and Capacity Planners use.

   Agent:  The network entity that accepts SNMP requests from a monitor
   or accounting application and provides access to the instrumentation
   for managing jobs modeled by the management objects defined in the
   Job Monitoring MIB module for a server or a device.

   Attribute:  A name, value-pair that specifies a job or document
   instruction, a status, or a condition of a job or a document that has
   been submitted to a server or device.  A particular attribute NEED
   NOT be present in each job instance.  In other words, attributes are
   present in a job instance only when there is a need to express the
   value, either because (1) the client supplied a value in the job
   submission protocol, (2) the document data contained an embedded
   attribute, or (3) the server or device supplied a default value.  An
   agent MAY represent an attribute as an entry (row) in the Attribute
   table in this MIB in which entries are present only when necessary.
   Attributes are identified in this MIB by an enum.

   Client:  The network entity that end users use to submit jobs to
   spoolers, servers, or printers and other devices, depending on the
   configuration, using any job submission protocol over a serial or
   parallel port to a directly-connected device or over the network to a
   networked-connected device.

   Device:  A hardware entity that (1) interfaces to humans, such as a
   device that produces marks on paper or scans marks on paper to
   produce an electronic representation, (2) accesses digital media,
   such as CD-ROMs, or (3) interfaces electronically to another device,
   such as sends FAX data to another FAX device.

   Document:  A sub-section within a job that contains print data and
   document instructions that apply to just the document.

   Document Instruction:  An instruction specifying how to process the
   document.  Document instructions MAY be passed in the job submission
   protocol separate from the actual document data, or MAY be embedded
   in the document data or a combination, depending on the job
   submission protocol and implementation.

   End User:  A user that uses a client to submit a print job.  See
   "user".

   Impression:  For a print job, an impression is the passage of the
   entire side of a sheet by the marker, whether or not any marks are
   made and independent of the number of passes that the side makes past
   the marker.  Thus a four pass color process counts as a single
   impression, as does highlight color.  Impression counters count all
   kinds:  monochrome, highlight color, and full process color, while
   full color counters only count full color impressions, and high light
   color counters only count high light color impressions.

   One-sided processing involves one impression per sheet.  Two-sided
   processing involves two impressions per sheet.  If a two-sided
   document has an odd number of pages, the last sheet still counts as
   two impressions, if that sheet makes two passes through the marker or
   the marker marks on both sides of a sheet in a single pass.  Two-up
   printing is the placement of two logical pages on one side of a sheet
   and so is still a single impression.  See "page" and "sheet".

   NOTE - Since impressions include blank sides, it is suggested that
   accounting application implementers consider charging for sheets,
   rather than impressions, possibly using the value of the sides
   attribute to select different charges for one-sided versus two-sided
   printing, since some users may think that impressions don't include
   blank sides.

   Internal Collation: The production of the sheets for each document
   copy performed within the printing device by making multiple passes
   over either the source or an intermediate representation of the
   document.

   Job:  A unit of work whose results are expected together without
   interjection of unrelated results.  A job contains one or more
   documents.

   Job Accounting:  The activity of a management application of
   accessing the MIB and recording what happens to the job during and
   after the processing of the job.

   Job Instruction:  An instruction specifying how, when, or where the
   job is to be processed.  Job instructions MAY be passed in the job
   submission protocol or MAY be embedded in the document data or a
   combination depending on the job submission protocol and
   implementation.

   Job Monitoring (using SNMP):  The activity of a management
   application of accessing the MIB and (1) identifying jobs in the job
   tables being processed by the server, printer or other devices, and
   (2) displaying information to the user about the processing of the
   job.

   Job Monitoring Application:  The SNMP management application that End
   Users, and System Operators use to monitor jobs using SNMP.  A
   monitor MAY be either a separate application or MAY be part of the
   client that also submits jobs.  See "monitor".

   Job Set:  A group of jobs that are queued and scheduled together
   according to a specified scheduling algorithm for a specified device
   or set of devices.  For implementations that embed the SNMP agent in
   the device, the MIB job set normally represents all the jobs known to
   the device, so that the implementation only implements a single job
   set.  If the SNMP agent is implemented in a server that controls one
   or more devices, each MIB job set represents a job queue for (1) a
   specific device or (2) set of devices, if the server uses a single
   queue to load balance between several devices.  Each job set is
   disjoint; no job SHALL be represented in more than one MIB job set.

   Monitor:  Short for Job Monitoring Application.

   Page:  A page is a logical division of the original source document.
   Number up is the imposition of more than one page on a single side of
   a sheet.  See "impression" and "sheet" and "two-up".

   Proxy:  An agent that acts as a concentrator for one or more other
   agents by accepting SNMP operations on the behalf of one or more
   other agents, forwarding them on to those other agents, gathering
   responses from those other agents and returning them to the original
   requesting monitor.

   Queuing:  The act of a device or server of ordering (queuing) the
   jobs for the purposes of scheduling the jobs to be processed.

   Printer:  A device that puts marks on media.

   Server:  A network entity that accepts jobs from clients and in turn
   submits the jobs to printers and other devices that may be directly
   connected to the server via a serial or parallel port or may be on
   the network.  A server MAY be a printer supervisor control program,
   or a print spooler.

   Sheet:  A sheet is a single instance of a medium, whether printing on
   one or both sides of the medium.  See "impression" and "page".

   SNMP Information Object:  A name, value-pair that specifies an
   action, a status, or a condition in an SNMP MIB.  Objects are
   identified in SNMP by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER.

   Spooler:  A server that accepts jobs, spools the data, and decides
   when and on which printer to print the job.  A spooler is a client to
   a printer or a printer supervisor, depending on implementation.

   Spooling:  The act of a device or server of (1) accepting jobs and
   (2) writing the job's attributes and document data on to secondary
   storage.

   Stacked:  When a media sheet is placed in an output bin of a device.

   Supervisor:  A server that contains a control program that controls a
   printer or other device.  A supervisor is a client to the printer or
   other device.

   System Operator:  A user that uses a monitor to monitor the system
   and carries out tasks to keep the system running.

   System Administrator:  A user that specifies policy for the system.

   Two-up:  The placement of two pages on one side of a sheet so that
   each side or impressions counts as two pages.  See "page" and
   "sheet".

   User:  A person that uses a client or a monitor.  See "end user".

   Figure 2-1 - Configuration 1 - client-printer - agent in the printer

   The Job Monitoring MIB is designed to support the following
   relationships (not shown in Figure 2-1):
        1. Multiple clients MAY submit jobs to a printer.
        2. Multiple clients MAY monitor a printer.
        3. Multiple monitors MAY monitor a printer.
        4. A client MAY submit jobs to multiple printers.
        5. A monitor MAY monitor multiple printers.

   jobs that the server has submitted to the printer.  The Job
   Monitoring MIB agent obtains the required information from the
   printer by a method that is beyond the scope of this document.  The

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/agent%20and%20server"></a>      agent and server</span>

   In the client-server-printer configuration 3, the client(s) submit
   jobs to an intermediate server by some network connection, not
   directly to the printer.  That server does not contain a Job
   Monitoring MIB agent.

   The job submitting client and/or monitoring application monitor jobs
   by communicating directly with:

        1. The server using some undefined protocol to monitor jobs in
           the server (that does not contain the Job Monitoring MIB) AND

        2. A Job Monitoring MIB agent that is part of the printer to
           monitor jobs after the server passes the jobs to the printer.

           In such configurations, the server deletes its copy of the
           job from the server after submitting the job to the printer
           usually almost immediately (before the job does much
           processing, if any).

   In configuration 3, the agent (in the printer) SHALL keep the values
   of the objects in the Job Monitoring MIB that the agent implements
   updated for a job that the server has submitted to the printer.  The
   agent SHALL obtain information about the jobs submitted to the
   printer from the server (either in the job submission protocol, in
   the document data, or by direct query of the server), in order to
   populate some of the objects the Job Monitoring MIB in the printer.
   The agent in the printer SHALL keep the job in the Job Monitoring MIB
   as long as the job is in the Printer, and longer in order to
   implement the completed state in which monitoring programs can copy
   out the accounting data from the Job Monitoring MIB.

   [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Keywords for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] as follows:

      "SHALL":  indicates an action that the subject of the sentence
      must implement in order to claim conformance to this specification

      "MAY":  indicates an action that the subject of the sentence does
      not have to implement in order to claim conformance to this
      specification, in other words that action is an implementation
      option

      "NEED NOT":  indicates an action that the subject of the sentence
      does not have to implement in order to claim conformance to this
      specification.  The verb "NEED NOT" is used instead of "may not",
      since "may not" sounds like a prohibition.

      "SHOULD":  indicates an action that is recommended for the subject
      of the sentence to implement, but is not required, in order to
      claim conformance to this specification.

   A conforming agent:

      1. SHALL implement all MANDATORY groups in this specification.

      2. SHALL implement any attributes if (1) the server or device
         supports the functionality represented by the attribute and (2)
         the information is available to the agent.

      3. SHOULD implement both forms of an attribute if it implements an
         attribute that permits a choice of INTEGER and OCTET STRING
         forms, since implementing both forms may help management
         applications by giving them a choice of representations, since
         the representation are equivalent.  See the JmAttributeTypeTC
         textual-convention.

   NOTE - This MIB, like the Printer MIB, is written following the
   subset of SMIv2 that can be supported by SMIv1 and SNMPv1
   implementations.

   [<a href="#ref-print-mib" title='"Printer MIB"'>print-mib</a>] and all the objects in other MIBs that conformance to the
   Printer MIB requires, such as the Host Resources MIB [<a href="#ref-hr-mib" title='"Host Resources MIB"'>hr-mib</a>].  If

   A conforming job monitoring application:

        1. SHALL accept the full syntactic range for all objects in all
           MANDATORY groups and all MANDATORY attributes that are
           required to be implemented by an agent according to <a href="#section-3.1.2">Section</a>

           them.

        2. SHALL accept the full syntactic range for all attributes,
           including enum and bit values specified in this specification
           and additional ones that may be registered with the PWG and
           SHALL either present them to the user or ignore them.  In
           particular, a conforming job monitoring application SHALL not
           malfunction when receiving any standard or registered enum or
           bit values.  See <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a> entitled "IANA and PWG

        3. SHALL NOT fail when operating with agents that materialize
           attributes after the job has been submitted, as opposed to
           when the job is submitted.

        4. SHALL, if it supports a time attribute, accept either form of
           the time attribute, since agents are free to implement either
           time form.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2%20The%20Job%20Tables%20and%20the%20Oldest%20Active%20and%20Newest%20Active%20Indexes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a> The Job Tables and the Oldest Active and Newest Active Indexes</span>

   The jmJobTable and jmAttributeTable contain objects and attributes,
   respectively, for each job in a job set.  These first two indexes
   are:
        1. jmGeneralJobSetIndex - which job set
        2. jmJobIndex - which job in the job set

   In order for a monitoring application to quickly find that active
   jobs (jobs in the pending, processing, or processingStopped states),
   the MIB contains two indexes:

        1. jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex - the index of the active job
           that has been in the tables the longest.

        2. jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex - the index of the active job
           that has been most recently added to the tables.

   The agent SHALL assign the next incremental value of jmJobIndex to
   the job, when a new job is accepted by the server or device to which
   the agent is providing access.  If the incremented value of
   jmJobIndex would exceed the implementation-defined maximum value for
   jmJobIndex, the agent SHALL 'wrap' back to 1.  An agent uses the
   resulting value of jmJobIndex for storing information in the
   jmJobTable and the jmAttributeTable about the job.

   It is recommended that the largest value for jmJobIndex be much
   larger than the maximum number of jobs that the implementation can
   contain at a single time, so as to minimize the premature re-use of a
   jmJobIndex value for a newer job while clients retain the same '
   stale' value for an older job.

   It is recommended that agents that are providing access to
   servers/devices that already allocate job-identifiers for jobs as
   integers use the same integer value for the jmJobIndex.  Then
   management applications using this MIB and applications using other
   protocols will see the same job identifiers for the same jobs.
   Agents providing access to systems that contain jobs with a job
   identifier of 0 SHALL map the job identifier value 0 to a jmJobIndex
   value that is one higher than the highest job identifier value that
   any job can have on that system.  Then only job 0 will have a
   different job-identifier value than the job's jmJobIndex value.

   NOTE - If a server or device accepts jobs using multiple job
   submission protocols, it may be difficult for the agent to meet the
   recommendation to use the job-identifier values that the server or

   device assigns as the jmJobIndex value, unless the server/device
   assigns job-identifiers for each of its job submission protocols from
   the same job-identifier number space.

   Each time a new job is accepted by the server or device that the
   agent is providing access to AND that job is to be 'active' (pending,
   processing, or processingStopped, but not pendingHeld), the agent
   SHALL copy the value of the job's jmJobIndex to the
   jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex object.  If the new job is to be '
   inactive' (pendingHeld state), the agent SHALL not change the value
   of jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex object (though the agent SHALL
   assign the next incremental jmJobIndex value to the job).

   When a job transitions from one of the 'active' job states (pending,
   processing, processingStopped) to one of the 'inactive' job states
   (pendingHeld, completed, canceled, or aborted), with a jmJobIndex
   value that matches the jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex object, the
   agent SHALL advance (or wrap) the value to the next oldest 'active'
   job, if any.  See the JmJobStateTC textual-convention for a
   definition of the job states.

   Whenever a job transitions from one of the 'inactive' job states to
   one of the 'active' job states (from pendingHeld to pending or
   processing), the agent SHALL update the value of either the
   jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex or the jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex
   objects, or both, if the job's jmJobIndex value is outside the range
   between jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex and
   jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex.

   When all jobs become 'inactive', i.e., enter the pendingHeld,
   completed, canceled, or aborted states, the agent SHALL set the value
   of both the jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex and
   jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex objects to 0.

   NOTE - Applications that wish to efficiently access all of the active
   jobs MAY use jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex value to start with the
   oldest active job and continue until they reach the index value equal
   to jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex, skipping over any pendingHeld,
   completed, canceled, or aborted jobs that might intervene.

   If an application detects that the jmGeneralNewestActiveJobIndex is
   smaller than jmGeneralOldestActiveJobIndex, the job index has
   wrapped.  In this case, the application SHALL reset the index to 1
   when the end of the table is reached and continue the GetNext
   operations to find the rest of the active jobs.

   NOTE - Applications detect the end of the jmAttributeTable table when
   the OID returned by the GetNext operation is an OID in a different
   MIB.  There is no object in this MIB that specifies the maximum value
   for the jmJobIndex supported by the implementation.

   When the server or device is power-cycled, the agent SHALL remember
   the next jmJobIndex value to be assigned, so that new jobs are not
   assigned the same jmJobIndex as recent jobs before the power cycle.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3%20The%20Attribute%20Mechanism%20and%20the%20Attribute%20Table%28s%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a> The Attribute Mechanism and the Attribute Table(s)</span>

   Attributes are similar to information objects, except that attributes
   are identified by an enum, instead of an OID, so that attributes may
   be registered without requiring a new MIB.  Also an implementation
   that does not have the functionality represented by the attribute can
   omit the attribute entirely, rather than having to return a
   distinguished value.  The agent is free to materialize an attribute
   in the jmAttributeTable as soon as the agent is aware of the value of
   the attribute.

   The agent materializes job attributes in a four-indexed
   jmAttributeTable:

        1. jmGeneralJobSetIndex - which job set

        2. jmJobIndex - which job in the job set

        3. jmAttributeTypeIndex - which attribute

        4. jmAttributeInstanceIndex - which attribute instance for those
           attributes that can have multiple values per job.

   Some attributes represent information about a job, such as a file-
   name, a document-name, a submission-time or a completion time.  Other
   attributes represent resources required, e.g., a medium or a
   colorant, etc. to process the job before the job starts processing OR
   to indicate the amount of the resource consumed during and after
   processing, e.g., pages completed or impressions completed.  If both
   a required and a consumed value of a resource is needed, this
   specification assigns two separate attribute enums in the textual
   convention.

   NOTE - The table of contents lists all the attributes in order.  This
   order is the order of enum assignments which is the order that the
   SNMP GetNext operation returns attributes.  Most attributes apply to
   all three configurations covered by this MIB specification (see

   <a href="#section-2.1">section 2.1</a> entitled "System Configurations for the Job Monitoring

   An agent SHALL implement any attribute if (1) the server or device
   supports the functionality represented by the attribute and (2) the
   information is available to the agent.  The agent MAY create the
   attribute row in the jmAttributeTable when the information is
   available or MAY create the row earlier with the designated 'unknown'
   value appropriate for that attribute.  See next section.

   If the server or device does not implement or does not provide access
   to the information about an attribute, the agent SHOULD NOT create
   the corresponding row in the jmAttributeTable.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.2%20Useful%2C%20%27Unknown%27%2C%20and%20%27Other%27%20Values%20for%20Objects%20and%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.2" name="section-3.3.2">3.3.2</a> Useful, 'Unknown', and 'Other' Values for Objects and Attributes</span>

   Some attributes have a 'useful' Integer32 value, some have a 'useful'
   OCTET STRING value, some MAY have either or both depending on
   implementation, and some MUST have both.  See the JmAttributeTypeTC
   textual convention for the specification of each attribute.

   SNMP requires that if an object cannot be implemented because its
   values cannot be accessed, then a compliant agent SHALL return an
   SNMP error in SNMPv1 or an exception value in SNMPv2.  However, this
   MIB has been designed so that 'all' objects can and SHALL be
   implemented by an agent, so that neither the SNMPv1 error nor the
   SNMPv2 exception value SHALL be generated by the agent.  This MIB has
   also been designed so that when an agent materializes an attribute,
   the agent SHALL materialize a row consisting of both the
   jmAttributeValueAsInteger and jmAttributeValueAsOctets objects.

   In general, values for objects and attributes have been chosen so
   that a management application will be able to determine whether a '
   useful', 'unknown', or 'other' value is available.  When a useful
   value is not available for an object, that agent SHALL return a
   zero-length string for octet strings, the value 'unknown(2)' for
   enums, a '0' value for an object that represents an index in another
   table, and a value '-2' for counting integers.

   Since each attribute is represented by a row consisting of both the
   jmAttributeValueAsInteger and jmAttributeValueAsOctets MANDATORY
   objects, SNMP requires that the agent SHALL always create an
   attribute row with both objects specified.  However, for most
   attributes the agent SHALL return a "useful" value for one of the

   objects and SHALL return the 'other' value for the other object.  For
   integer only attributes, the agent SHALL always return a zero-length
   string value for the jmAttributeValueAsOctets object.  For octet
   string only attributes, the agent SHALL always return a '-1' value
   for the jmAttributeValueAsInteger object.

   A number of attributes are indexes in other tables.  Such attribute
   names end with the word 'Index'.  If the agent has not (yet) assigned
   an index value for a particular index attribute for a job, the agent
   SHALL either: (1) return the value 0 or (2) not add this attribute to
   the jmAttributeTable until the index value is assigned.  In the
   interests of brevity, the semantics for 0 is specified once here and
   is not repeated for each index attribute specification and a DEFVAL
   of 0 is implied, even though the DEFVAL for jmAttributeValueAsInteger
   is -2.

   Many attributes are sub-typed to give a more specific data type than
   Integer32 or OCTET STRING.  The data sub-type of each attribute is
   indicated on the first line(s) of the description.  Some attributes
   have several different data sub-type representations.  When an
   attribute has both an Integer32 data sub-type and an OCTET STRING
   data sub-type, the attribute can be represented in a single row in
   the jmAttributeTable.  In this case, the data sub-type name is not
   included as the last part of the name of the attribute, e.g.,
   documentFormat(38) which is both an enum and/or a name.  When the
   data sub-types cannot be represented by a single row in the
   jmAttributeTable, each such representation is considered a separate
   attribute and is assigned a separate name and enum value.  For these
   attributes, the name of the data sub-type is the last part of the
   name of the attribute: Name, Index, DateAndTime, TimeStamp, etc.  For
   example, documentFormatIndex(37) is an index.

   NOTE: The Table of Contents also lists the data sub-type and/or data
   sub-types of each attribute, using the textual-convention name when
   such is defined.  The following abbreviations are used in the Table
   of Contents as shown:

   Most attributes have only one row per job.  However, a few attributes
   can have multiple values per job or even per document, where each
   value is a separate row in the jmAttributeTable.  Unless indicated
   with 'MULTI-ROW:' in the JmAttributeTypeTC description, an agent
   SHALL ensure that each attribute occurs only once in the
   jmAttributeTable for a job.  Most of the 'MULTI-ROW' attributes do
   not allow duplicate values, i.e., the agent SHALL ensure that each
   value occurs only once for a job.  Only if the specification of the '
   MULTI-ROW' attribute also says "There is no restriction on the same
   xxx occurring in multiple rows" can the agent allow duplicate values
   to occur for the job.

   NOTE - Duplicates are allowed for 'extensive' 'MULTI-ROW' attributes,
   such as fileName(34) or documentName(35) which are specified to be '
   per-document' attributes, but are not allowed for 'intensive' '

   A number of objects and attributes record requirements for the job.
   Such object and attribute names end with the word 'Requested'.  In
   the interests of brevity, the phrase 'requested' means: (1) requested
   by the client (or intervening server) in the job submission protocol
   and may also mean (2) embedded in the submitted document data, and/or
   (3) defaulted by the recipient device or server with the same
   semantics as if the requester had supplied, depending on
   implementation.  Also if a value is supplied by the job submission
   client, and the server/device determines a better value, through
   processing or other means, the agent MAY return that better value for
   such object and attribute.

   This section specifies the job attributes.

   In the following definitions of the attributes, each description
   indicates whether the useful value of the attribute SHALL be
   represented using the jmAttributeValueAsInteger or the
   jmAttributeValueAsOctets objects by the initial tag: 'INTEGER:' or '
   OCTETS:', respectively.

   Some attributes allow the agent implementer a choice of useful values
   of either an integer, an octet string representation, or both,
   depending on implementation.  These attributes are indicated with '
   INTEGER:' AND/OR 'OCTETS:' tags.

   A very few attributes require both objects at the same time to
   represent a pair of useful values (see mediumConsumed(171)).  These
   attributes are indicated with 'INTEGER:' AND 'OCTETS:' tags.  See the
   jmAttributeGroup for the descriptions of these two MANDATORY objects.

   NOTE - The enum assignments are grouped logically with values
   assigned in groups of 20, so that additional values may be registered
   in the future and assigned a value that is part of their logical
   grouping.

   Values in the range 2**30 to 2**31-1 are reserved for private or
   experimental usage.  This range corresponds to the same range
   reserved in IPP.  Implementers are warned that use of such values may
   conflict with other implementations.  Implementers are encouraged to
   request registration of enum values following the procedures in

    jobStateReasons2(3),              JmJobStateReasons2TC
        INTEGER:  Additional information about the job's current state
        that augments the jmJobState object.  See the description under
        the JmJobStateReasons1TC textual-convention.

    jobStateReasons3(4),              JmJobStateReasons3TC
        INTEGER:  Additional information about the job's current state
        that augments the jmJobState object.  See the description under
        JmJobStateReasons1TC textual-convention.

    jobStateReasons4(5),              JmJobStateReasons4TC
        INTEGER:  Additional information about the job's current state
        that augments the jmJobState object.  See the description under
        JmJobStateReasons1TC textual-convention.

    processingMessage(6),             JmUTF8StringTC (SIZE(0..63))
        OCTETS:  MULTI-ROW:  A coded character set message that is
        generated by the server or device during the processing of the
        job as a simple form of processing log to show progress and any
        problems.  The natural language of each value is specified by
        the corresponding processingMessageNaturalLangTag(7) value.

        NOTE - This attribute is intended for such conditions as
        interpreter messages, rather than being the printable form of
        the jmJobState and jmJobStateReasons1 objects and
        jobStateReasons2, jobStateReasons3, and jobStateReasons4
        attributes.  In order to produce a localized printable form of
        these job state objects/attribute, a management application
        SHOULD produce a message from their enum and bit values.

        NOTE - There is no job description attribute in IPP/1.0 that
        corresponds to this attribute and this attribute does not
        correspond to the IPP/1.0 'job-state-message' job description
        attribute, which is just a printable form of the IPP 'job-state'
        and 'job-state-reasons' job attributes.

        There is no restriction for the same message occurring in
        multiple rows.

    processingMessageNaturalLangTag(7),   OCTET STRING(SIZE(0..63))
        OCTETS:  MULTI-ROW:  The natural language of the corresponding
        processingMessage(6) attribute value.  See <a href="#section-3.6.1">section 3.6.1</a>,
        entitled 'Text generated by the server or device'.

        If the agent does not know the natural language of the job
        processing message, the agent SHALL either (1) return a zero
        length string value for the processingMessageNaturalLangTag(7)
        attribute or (2) not return the
        processingMessageNaturalLangTag(7) attribute for the job.

        There is no restriction for the same tag occurring in multiple
        rows, since when this attribute is implemented, it SHOULD have a
        value row for each corresponding processingMessage(6) attribute
        value row.

    jobCodedCharSet(8),               CodedCharSet
        INTEGER:  The MIBenum identifier of the coded character set that
        the agent is using to represent coded character set objects and
        attributes of type 'JmJobStringTC'.  These coded character set
        objects and attributes are either: (1) supplied by the job
        submitting client or (2) defaulted by the server or device when
        omitted by the job submitting client.  The agent SHALL represent
        these objects and attributes in the MIB either (1) in the coded
        character set as they were submitted or (2) MAY convert the
        coded character set to another coded character set or encoding
        scheme as identified by the jobCodedCharSet(8) attribute.  See
        <a href="#section-3.6.2">section 3.6.2</a>, entitled 'Text supplied by the job submitter'.

        These MIBenum values are assigned by IANA [<a href="#ref-IANA-charsets">IANA-charsets</a>] when
        the coded character sets are registered.  The coded character
        set SHALL be one of the ones registered with IANA [IANA] and the
        enum value uses the CodedCharSet textual-convention from the
        Printer MIB.  See the JmJobStringTC textual-convention.

        If the agent does not know what coded character set was used by
        the job submitting client, the agent SHALL either (1) return the
        'unknown(2)' value for the jobCodedCharSet(8) attribute or (2)
        not return the jobCodedCharSet(8) attribute for the job.

    jobNaturalLanguageTag(9),         OCTET STRING(SIZE(0..63))
        OCTETS: The natural language of the job attributes supplied by
        the job submitter or defaulted by the server or device for the
        job, i.e., all objects and attributes represented by the '

    + Job Identification attributes (20 - 49 decimal)
    +
    + The following attributes help an end user, a system
    + operator, or an accounting program identify a job.
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    jobURI(20),                       OCTET STRING(SIZE(0..63))
        OCTETS:  MULTI-ROW:  The job's Universal Resource
        Identifier (URI) [<a href="rfc1738.html" title='"Uniform Resource Locators (URL)"'>RFC1738</a>].  See IPP [<a href="#ref-ipp-model" title='"The Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>ipp-model</a>] for
        example usage.

        NOTE - The agent may be able to generate this value on each
        SNMP Get operation from smaller values, rather than having
        to store the entire URI.

        If the URI exceeds 63 octets, the agent SHALL use multiple
        values, with the next 63 octets coming in the second value,
        etc.

        NOTE - IPP [<a href="#ref-ipp-model" title='"The Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>ipp-model</a>] has a 1023-octet maximum length for
        a URI, though the URI standard itself and HTTP/1.1 specify
        no maximum length.

    jobAccountName(21),               OCTET STRING(SIZE(0..63))
        OCTETS:  Arbitrary binary information which MAY be coded
        character set data or encrypted data supplied by the
        submitting user for use by accounting services to allocate
        or categorize charges for services provided, such as a
        customer account name or number.

        NOTE: This attribute NEED NOT be printable characters.

    serverAssignedJobName(22),        JmJobStringTC (SIZE(0..63))
        OCTETS:  Configuration 3 only:  The human readable string
        name, number, or ID of the job as assigned by the server
        that submitted the job to the device that the agent is
        providing access to with this MIB.

        NOTE - This attribute is intended for enabling a user to
        find his/her job that a server submitted to a device when
        either the client does not support the jmJobSubmissionID or
        the server does not pass the jmJobSubmissionID through to
        the device.

    jobName(23),                      JmJobStringTC (SIZE(0..63))
        OCTETS:  The human readable string name of the job as
        assigned by the submitting user to help the user
        distinguish between his/her various jobs.  This name does
        not need to be unique.

        This attribute is intended for enabling a user or the
        user's application to convey a job name that MAY be printed
        on a start sheet, returned in a query result, or used in
        notification or logging messages.

        In order to assist users to find their jobs for job
        submission protocols that don't supply a jmJobSubmissionID,
        the agent SHOULD maintain the jobName attribute for the
        time specified by the jmGeneralJobPersistence object,
        rather than the (shorter) jmGeneralAttributePersistence
        object.

        If this attribute is not specified when the job is
        submitted, no job name is assumed, but implementation
        specific defaults are allowed, such as the value of the
        documentName attribute of the first document in the job or
        the fileName attribute of the first document in the job.

        The jobName attribute is distinguished from the jobComment
        attribute, in that the jobName attribute is intended to
        permit the submitting user to distinguish between different
        jobs that he/she has submitted.  The jobComment attribute
        is intended to be free form additional information that a
        user might wish to use to communicate with himself/herself,
        such as a reminder of what to do with the results or to
        indicate a different set of input parameters were tried in
        several different job submissions.

    jobServiceTypes(24),              JmJobServiceTypesTC
        INTEGER:  Specifies the type(s) of service to which the job
        has been submitted (print, fax, scan, etc.).  The service
        type is bit encoded with each job service type so that more
        general and arbitrary services can be created, such as
        services with more than one destination type, or ones with
        only a source or only a destination.  For example, a job
        service might scan, faxOut, and print a single job.  In
        this case, three bits would be set in the jobServiceTypes
        attribute, corresponding to the hexadecimal values: 0x8 +
        0x20 + 0x4, respectively, yielding: 0x2C.

        Whether this attribute is set from a job attribute supplied
        by the job submission client or is set by the recipient job
        submission server or device depends on the job submission
        protocol.  This attribute SHALL be implemented if the
        server or device has other types in addition to or instead
        of printing.

        One of the purposes of this attribute is to permit a
        requester to filter out jobs that are not of interest.  For
        example, a printer operator may only be interested in jobs
        that include printing.

    jobSourceChannelIndex(25),        Integer32 (0..2147483647)
        INTEGER:  The index of the row in the associated Printer
        MIB [<a href="#ref-print-mib" title='"Printer MIB"'>print-mib</a>] of the channel which is the source of the
        print job.

    jobSourcePlatformType(26),        JmJobSourcePlatformTypeTC
        INTEGER:  The source platform type of the immediate
        upstream submitter that submitted the job to the server
        (configuration 2) or device (configuration 1 and 3) to
        which the agent is providing access.  For configuration 1,
        this is the type of the client that submitted the job to
        the device;  for configuration 2, this is the type of the
        client that submitted the job to the server; and for
        configuration 3, this is the type of the server that
        submitted the job to the device.

    submittingServerName(27),         JmJobStringTC (SIZE(0..63))
        OCTETS:  For configuration 3 only:  The administrative name
        of the server that submitted the job to the device.

    submittingApplicationName(28),    JmJobStringTC (SIZE(0..63))
        OCTETS:  The name of the client application (not the server
        in configuration 3) that submitted the job to the server or
        device.

        server or device.

    deviceNameRequested(30),          JmJobStringTC (SIZE(0..63))
        OCTETS:  The administratively defined coded character set
        name of the target device requested by the submitting user.
        For configuration 1, its value corresponds to the Printer
        MIB [<a href="#ref-print-mib" title='"Printer MIB"'>print-mib</a>]: prtGeneralPrinterName object.  For
        configuration 2 and 3, its value is the name of the logical
        or physical device that the user supplied to indicate to
        the server on which device(s) they wanted the job to be
        processed.

    queueNameRequested(31),           JmJobStringTC (SIZE(0..63))
        OCTETS:  The administratively defined coded character set
        name of the target queue requested by the submitting user.
        For configuration 1, its value corresponds to the queue in
        the device for which the agent is providing access.  For
        configuration 2 and 3, its value is the name of the queue
        that the user supplied to indicate to the server on which
        device(s) they wanted the job to be processed.

        NOTE - typically an implementation SHOULD support either

    jobPriority(50),                  Integer32 (-2..100)
        INTEGER:  The priority for scheduling the job.  It is used by
        servers and devices that employ a priority-based scheduling
        algorithm.

        A higher value specifies a higher priority.  The value 1 is
        defined to indicate the lowest possible priority (a job which a
        priority-based scheduling algorithm SHALL pass over in favor of
        higher priority jobs).  The value 100 is defined to indicate the
        highest possible priority.  Priority is expected to be evenly or
        'normally' distributed across this range.  The mapping of

   The JmJobStateReasonsNTC (N=1..4) textual-conventions are used with
   the jmJobStateReasons1 object and jobStateReasonsN (N=2..4),
   respectively, to provide additional information regarding the current
   jmJobState object value.  These values MAY be used with any job state
   or states for which the reason makes sense.

   NOTE - While values cannot be added to the jmJobState object without
   impacting deployed clients that take actions upon receiving
   jmJobState values, it is the intent that additional
   JmJobStateReasonsNTC enums can be defined and registered without
   impacting such deployed clients.  In other words, the
   jmJobStateReasons1 object and jobStateReasonsN attributes are
   intended to be extensible.

   NOTE - The Job Monitoring MIB contains a superset of the IPP values
   [<a href="#ref-ipp-model" title='"The Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>ipp-model</a>] for the IPP 'job-state-reasons' attribute, since the Job
   Monitoring MIB is intended to cover other job submission protocols as
   well.  Also some of the names of the reasons have been changed from '
   printer' to 'device', since the Job Monitoring MIB is intended to
   cover additional types of devices, including input devices, such as
   scanners.

   The following standard values are defined (in hexadecimal) as powers
   of two, since multiple values MAY be used at the same time.  For ease
   of understanding, the JmJobStateReasons1TC reasons are presented in
   the order in which the reasons are likely to occur (if implemented),
   starting with the 'jobIncoming' value and ending with the '
   jobCompletedWithErrors' value.

    other                             0x1
        The job state reason is not one of the standardized or
        registered reasons.

    unknown                           0x2
        The job state reason is not known to the agent or is
        indeterminent.

    jobIncoming                       0x4
        The job has been accepted by the server or device, but the
        server or device is expecting (1) additional operations from the
        client to finish creating the job and/or (2) is
        accessing/accepting document data.

    submissionInterrupted             0x8
        The job was not completely submitted for some unforeseen reason,
        such as: (1) the server has crashed before the job was closed by
        the client, (2) the server or the document transfer method has
        crashed in some non-recoverable way before the document data was
        entirely transferred to the server, (3) the client crashed or
        failed to close the job before the time-out period.

    jobOutgoing                       0x10
        Configuration 2 only:  The server is transmitting the job to the
        device.

    jobHoldSpecified                  0x20
        The value of the job's jobHold(52) attribute is TRUE.  The job
        SHALL NOT be a candidate for processing until this reason is
        removed and there are no other reasons to hold the job.

    jobHoldUntilSpecified             0x40
        The value of the job's jobHoldUntil(53) attribute specifies a
        time period that is still in the future.  The job SHALL NOT be a
        candidate for processing until this reason is removed and there
        are no other reasons to hold the job.

    jobProcessAfterSpecified          0x80
        The value of the job's jobProcessAfterDateAndTime(51) attribute
        specifies a time that is still in the future.  The job SHALL NOT
        be a candidate for processing until this reason is removed and
        there are no other reasons to hold the job.

    resourcesAreNotReady              0x100
        At least one of the resources needed by the job, such as media,
        fonts, resource objects, etc., is not ready on any of the
        physical devices for which the job is a candidate.  This
        condition MAY be detected when the job is accepted, or
        subsequently while the job is pending or processing, depending
        on implementation.

    deviceStoppedPartly               0x200
        One or more, but not all, of the devices to which the job is
        assigned are stopped.  If all of the devices are stopped (or the
        only device is stopped), the deviceStopped reason SHALL be used.

    deviceStopped                     0x400
        The device(s) to which the job is assigned is (are all) stopped.

    jobInterpreting                   0x800
        The device to which the job is assigned is interpreting the
        document data.

    jobPrinting                       0x1000
        The output device to which the job is assigned is marking media.
        This value is useful for servers and output devices which spend
        a great deal of time processing (1) when no marking is happening
        and then want to show that marking is now happening or (2) when
        the job is in the process of being canceled or aborted while the
        job remains in the processing state, but the marking has not yet
        stopped so that impression or sheet counts are still increasing
        for the job.

    jobCanceledByUser                 0x2000
        The job was canceled by the owner of the job, i.e., by a user
        whose name is the same as the value of the job's jmJobOwner
        object, or by some other authorized end-user, such as a member
        of the job owner's security group.

    jobCanceledByOperator             0x4000
        The job was canceled by the operator, i.e., by a user who has
        been authenticated as having operator privileges (whether local
        or remote).

    jobCanceledAtDevice               0x8000
        The job was canceled by an unidentified local user, i.e., a user
        at a console at the device.

    abortedBySystem                   0x10000
        The job (1) is in the process of being aborted, (2) has been
        aborted by the system and placed in the 'aborted' state, or (3)
        has been aborted by the system and placed in the 'pendingHeld'
        state, so that a user or operator can manually try the job
        again.

    processingToStopPoint             0x20000
        The requester has issued an operation to cancel or interrupt the
        job or the server/device has aborted the job, but the
        server/device is still performing some actions on the job until
        a specified stop point occurs or job termination/cleanup is
        completed.

        This reason is recommended to be used in conjunction with the
        processing job state to indicate that the server/device is still
        performing some actions on the job while the job remains in the
        processing state.  After all the job's resources consumed
        counters  have stopped incrementing, the server/device moves the
        job from the processing state to the canceled or aborted job
        states.

    serviceOffLine                    0x40000
        The service or document transform is off-line and accepting no
        jobs.  All pending jobs are put into the pendingHeld state.
        This situation could be true if the service's or document
        transform's input is impaired or broken.

    jobCompletedSuccessfully          0x80000
        The job completed successfully.

    jobCompletedWithWarnings          0x100000
        The job completed with warnings.

    jobCompletedWithErrors            0x200000
        The job completed with errors (and possibly warnings too).


   The following additional job state reasons have been added to
   represent job states that are in ISO DPA [<a href="#ref-iso-dpa">iso-dpa</a>] and other job
   submission protocols:

    jobPaused                         0x400000
        The job has been indefinitely suspended by a client issuing an
        operation to suspend the job so that other jobs may proceed
        using the same devices.  The client MAY issue an operation to
        resume the paused job at any time, in which case the agent SHALL
        remove the jobPaused values from the job's jmJobStateReasons1
        object and the job is eventually resumed at or near the point
        where the job was paused.

    jobInterrupted                    0x800000 The job has been
        interrupted while processing by a client
        issuing an operation that specifies another job to be run
        instead of the current job.  The server or device will
        automatically resume the interrupted job when the interrupting
        job completes.

    jobRetained                       0x1000000
        The job is being retained by the server or device with all of
        the job's document data (and submitted resources, such as fonts,
        logos, and forms, if any).  Thus a client could issue an
        operation to the server or device to either (1) re-do the job
        (or a copy of the job) on the same server or device or (2)
        resubmit the job to another server or device.  When a client
        could no longer re-do/resubmit the job, such as after the
        document data has been discarded, the agent SHALL remove the
        jobRetained value from the jmJobStateReasons1 object.

        These bit definitions are the equivalent of a type 2 enum except
        that combinations of bits may be used together.  See <a href="#section-3.7.1.2">section</a>

        An outbound gateway has transmitted all of the job's job and
        document attributes and data to another spooling system.

    deletedByAdministrator            0x2
        The administrator has deleted the job.

    discardTimeArrived                0x4
        The job has been deleted due to the fact that the time specified
        by the job's job-discard-time attribute has arrived.

        The post-processing agent failed while trying to log accounting
        attributes for the job; therefore the job has been placed into
        the completed state with the jobRetained jmJobStateReasons1
        object value for a system-defined period of time, so the
        administrator can examine it, resubmit it, etc.

        time-out value.

    needsKeyOperatorTimeOut           0x80
        One or more devices or document transforms that the job is using
        need a specially trained operator (who may need a key to unlock
        the device and gain access) in order for the job to make
        progress, but the key operator intervention did not occur within
        the site-settable time-out value.

    jobStartWaitTimeOut               0x100
        The server/device has stopped the job at the beginning of
        processing to await human action, such as installing a special
        cartridge or special non-standard media, but the job was not
        resumed within the site-settable time-out value and the
        server/device has transitioned the job to the pendingHeld state.

    jobEndWaitTimeOut                 0x200
        The server/device has stopped the job at the end of processing

        specified by the device's site-settable attribute.

    connectingToDeviceTimeOut         0x1000
        The server is attempting to connect to one or more devices which
        may be dial-up, polled, or queued, and so may be busy with
        traffic from other systems, but server was unable to connect to
        the device within the site-settable time-out value.

    transferring                      0x2000

    jobPasswordWait                   0x20000
        The server/device has selected the job to be next to process,
        but instead of assigning resources and starting the job
        processing, the server/device has transitioned the job to the
        pendingHeld state to await entry of a password (and dispatched
        another job, if there is one).

    validating                        0x40000
        The server/device is validating the job after accepting the job.

    noSpaceOnServer                   0x800000
        There is no room on the server to store all of the job.

    pinRequired                       0x1000000
        The System Administrator settable device policy is (1) to
        require PINs, and (2) to hold jobs that do not have a pin
        supplied as an input parameter when the job was created.

    exceededAccountLimit              0x2000000
        The account for which this job is drawn has exceeded its limit.
        This condition SHOULD be detected before the job is scheduled so
        that the user does not wait until his/her job is scheduled only
        to find that the account is overdrawn.  This condition MAY also
        occur while the job is processing either as processing begins or
        part way through processing.

    heldForRetry                      0x4000000
        The job encountered some errors that the server/device could not
        recover from with its normal retry procedures, but the error
        might not be encountered if the job is processed again in the
        future.  Example cases are phone number busy or remote file
        system in-accessible.  For such a situation, the server/device
        SHALL transition the job from the processing to the pendingHeld,
        rather than to the aborted state.

    The following values are from the X/Open PSIS draft standard:

    canceledByShutdown                0x8000000
        The job was canceled because the server or device was shutdown
        before completing the job.

    deviceUnavailable                 0x10000000
        This job was aborted by the system because the device is
        currently unable to accept jobs.

    wrongDevice                       0x20000000
        This job was aborted by the system because the device is unable
        to handle this particular job; the spooler SHOULD try another
        device or the user should submit the job to another device.

    badJob                            0x40000000
        This job was aborted by the system because this job has a major
        problem, such as an ill-formed PDL; the spooler SHOULD not even
        try another device.

   There are a number of objects and attributes for monitoring the
   progress of a job.  These objects and attributes count the number of
   K octets, impressions, sheets, and pages requested or completed.  For
   impressions and sheets, "completed" means stacked, unless the
   implementation is unable to detect when each sheet is stacked, in
   which case stacked is approximated when processing of each sheet
   completes.  There are objects and attributes for the overall job and
   for the current copy of the document currently being stacked.  For
   the latter, the rate at which the various objects and attributes
   count depends on the sheet and document collation of the job.

   Job Collation included sheet collation and document collation.  Sheet
   collation is defined to be the ordering of sheets within a document
   copy.  Document collation is defined to be ordering of document
   copies within a multi-document job.  There are three types of job
   collation (see terminology definitions in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>):

     1.uncollatedSheets(3) - No collation of the sheets within each
       document copy, i.e., each sheet of a document that is to produce
       multiple copies is replicated before the next sheet in the
       document is processed and stacked.  If the device has an output
       bin collator, the uncollatedSheets(3) value may actually produce
       collated sheets as far as the user is concerned (in the output
       bins).  However, when the job collation is the to a monitoring
       application between a device that has an output bin collator and
       one that does not.

     2.collatedDocuments(4) - Collation of the sheets within each
       document copy is performed within the printing device by making
       multiple passes over either the source or an intermediate
       representation of the document.  In addition, when there are
       multiple documents per job, the i'th copy of each document is
       stacked before the j'th copy of each document, i.e., the
       documents are collated within each job copy.  For example, if a
       job is submitted with documents, A and B, the job is made
       available to the end user as: A, B, A, B, ....  The '
       collatedDocuments(4)' value corresponds to the IPP [<a href="#ref-ipp-model" title='"The Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>ipp-model</a>] '
       separate-documents-collated-copies' value of the "multiple-
       document-handling" attribute.

       If jobCopiesRequested or documentCopiesRequested = 1, then
       jobCollationType is defined as 4.

     3.uncollatedDocuments(5) - Collation of the sheets within each
       document copy is performed within the printing device by making
       multiple passes over either the source or an intermediate
       representation of the document.  In addition, when there are
       multiple documents per job, all copies of the first document in
       the job are stacked before the any copied of the next document in
       the job, i.e., the documents are uncollated within the job.  For
       example, if a job is submitted with documents, A and B, the job
       is mad available to the end user as:  A, A, ..., B, B, ....  The
       'uncollatedDocuments(5)' value corresponds to the IPP [<a href="#ref-ipp-model" title='"The Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>ipp-model</a>]
       'separate-documents-uncollated-copies' value of the "multiple-
       document-handling" attribute.

   Consider the following four variables that are used to monitor the
   progress of a job's impressions:

     1.jmJobImpressionsCompleted - counts the total number of
       impressions stacked for the job

     2.impressionsCompletedCurrentCopy - counts the number of
       impressions stacked for the current document copy

     3.sheetCompletedCopyNumber - identifies the number of the copy for
       the current document being stacked where the first copy is 1.

     4.sheetCompletedDocumentNumber - identifies the current document
       within the job that is being stacked where the first document in
       a job is 1.  NOTE: this attribute SHOULD NOT be implemented for
       implementations that only support one document per job.

   For each of the three types of job collation, a job with three copies
   of two documents (1, 2), where each document consists of 3
   impressions, the four variables have the following values as each
   sheet is stacked for one-sided printing:

   There are a number of attributes that permit a user, operator or
   system administrator to identify jobs of interest, such as jobURI,
   jobName, jobOriginatingHost, etc.  In addition, there is a
   jmJobSubmissionID object that is a text string table index.  Being a
   table index allows a monitoring application to quickly locate and
   identify a particular job of interest that was submitted from a
   particular client by the user invoking the monitoring application
   without having to scan the entire job table.  The Job Monitoring MIB
   needs to provide for identification of the job at both sides of the
   job submission process.  The primary identification point is the
   client side.  The jmJobSubmissionID allows the monitoring application
   to identify the job of interest from all the jobs currently "known"
   by the server or device.  The value of jmJobSubmissionID can be
   assigned by either the client's local system or a downstream server
   or device.  The point of assignment depends on the job submission
   protocol in use.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2707.html">RFC 2707</a>               Job Monitoring MIB - V1.0           November 1999</span>


   The server/device-side identifier, called the jmJobIndex object,
   SHALL be assigned by the SNMP Job Monitoring MIB agent when the
   server or device accepts the jobs from submitting clients.  The
   jmJobIndex object allows the interested party to obtain all objects
   desired that relate to a particular job.  See <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>, entitled '
   The Job Tables and the Oldest Active and Newest Active Indexes' for
   the specification of how the agent SHALL assign the jmJobIndex
   values.

   The MIB provides a mapping table that maps each jmJobSubmissionID
   value to a corresponding jmJobIndex value generated by the agent, so
   that an application can determine the correct value for the
   jmJobIndex value for the job of interest in a single Get operation,
   given the Job Submission ID.  See the jmJobIDGroup.

   In some configurations there may be more than one application program
   that monitors the same job when the job passes from one network
   entity to another when it is submitted.  See configuration 3.  When
   there are multiple job submission IDs, each entity MAY supply an
   appropriate jmJobSubmissionID value.  In this case there would be a
   separate entry in the jmJobSubmissionID table, one for each
   jmJobSubmissionID.  All entries would map to the same jmJobIndex that
   contains the job data.  When the job is deleted, it is up to the
   agent to remove all entries that point to the job from the
   jmJobSubmissionID table as well.

   The jobName attribute provides a name that the user supplies as a job
   attribute with the job.  The jobName attribute is not necessarily
   unique, even for one user, let alone across users.

   This section specifies the formats for each of the registered Job
   Submission Ids.  This format is used by the JmJobSubmissionIDTypeTC.
   Each job submission ID is a fixed-length, 48-octet printable US-ASCII
   [<a href="#ref-US-ASCII">US-ASCII</a>] coded character string containing no control characters,
   consisting of the following fields:

          octet  1:  The format letter identifying the format.  The
            US-ASCII characters '0-9', 'A-Z', and 'a-z' are assigned
            in order giving 62 possible formats.
          octets 2-40:  A 39-character, US-ASCII trailing SPACE
            filled field specified by the format letter, if the data
            is less than 39 ASCII characters.
          octets 41-48:  A sequential or random US-ASCII number to
            make the ID quasi-unique.

   If the client does not supply a job submission ID in the job
   submission protocol, then the agent SHALL assign a job submission ID
   using any of the standard formats that are reserved for the agent.
   Clients SHALL not use formats that are reserved for agents and agents
   SHALL NOT use formats that are reserved for clients, in order to
   reduce conflicts in ID generation.  See the description for which
   formats are reserved for clients or for agents.

   Registration of additional formats may be done following the
   procedures described in <a href="#section-3.7.3">Section 3.7.3</a>.

   The format values defined at the time of completion of this
   specification are:

        'G' IPDS on the OS/400 platform
        octets 2-40:  Contains bytes 2-36 of the XOH Define Group
            Boundary Group ID triplet.  Octet position 2 MUST carry
            the value x'03'.  Bytes 37-40 MUST be filled with spaces.

        This format is reserved for agents, since the agent supplies
            octets 41-48, though the client supplies the job name.

   NOTE - the job submission id is only intended to be unique between a
   limited set of clients for a limited duration of time, namely, for
   the life time of the job in the context of the server or device that
   is processing the job.  Some of the formats include something that is
   unique per client and a random number so that the same job submitted
   by the same client will have a different job submission id.  For
   other formats, where part of the id is guaranteed to be unique for
   each client, such as the MAC address or URL, a sequential number
   SHOULD suffice for each client (and may be easier for each client to
   manage).  Therefore, the length of the job submission id has been
   selected to reduce the probability of collision to an extremely low
   number, but is not intended to be an absolute guarantee of
   uniqueness.  None-the-less, collisions are remotely possible, but

   There are a few objects and attributes generated by the server or
   device that SHALL be represented using the Universal Multiple-Octet
   Coded Character Set (UCS) [<a href="#ref-ISO-10646" title='"Information technology -- Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set (UCS) - Part 1: Architecture and Basic Multilingual Plane'>ISO-10646</a>].  These objects and attributes
   are always supplied (if implemented) by the agent, not by the job
   submitting client:
      1. jmGeneralJobSetName object
      2. processingMessage(6) attribute
      3. physicalDevice(32) (name value) attribute

   The character encoding scheme for representing these objects and
   attributes SHALL be UTF-8 as REQUIRED by <a href="rfc2277.html">RFC 2277</a> [<a href="rfc2277.html" title='"IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages"'>RFC2277</a>].  The '
   JmUTF8StringTC' textual convention is used to indicate UTF-8 text
   strings.

   NOTE - For strings in 7-bit US-ASCII, there is no impact since the
   UTF-8 representation of 7-bit ASCII is identical to the US-ASCII
   [<a href="#ref-US-ASCII">US-ASCII</a>] encoding.

   The text contained in the processingMessage(6) attribute is generated
   by the server/device.  The natural language for the
   processingMessage(6) attribute is identified by the
   processingMessageNaturalLangTag(7) attribute.  The
   processingMessageNaturalLangTag(7) attribute uses the
   JmNaturalLanguageTagTC textual convention which SHALL conform to the
   language tag mechanism specified in <a href="rfc1766.html">RFC 1766</a> [<a href="rfc1766.html" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>RFC1766</a>].  The
   JmNaturalLanguageTagTC value is the same as the IPP [<a href="#ref-ipp-model" title='"The Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>ipp-model</a>] '
   naturalLanguage' attribute syntax.  <a href="rfc1766.html">RFC 1766</a> specifies that a US-
   ASCII string consisting of the natural language followed by an
   optional country field. Both fields use the same two-character codes
   from ISO 639 [<a href="#ref-ISO-639" title="1st edition">ISO-639</a>] and ISO 3166 [<a href="#ref-ISO-3166" title="3rd edition">ISO-3166</a>], respectively, that
   are used in the Printer MIB for identifying language and country.

   Examples of the values of the processingMessageNaturalLangTag(7)
   attribute include:
        1. 'en'    for English
        2. 'en-us' for US English
        3. 'fr'    for French
        4. 'de'    for German

   All of the objects and attributes represented by the 'JmJobStringTC'
   textual-convention are either (1) supplied in the job submission

   objects and attributes in the MIB either (1) in the coded character
   set as they were submitted or (2) MAY convert the coded character set
   to another coded character set or encoding scheme.  In any case, the
   resulting coded character set representation SHOULD be UTF-8 [<a href="#ref-UTF-8" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>UTF-8</a>],
   but SHALL be one in which the code positions from 0 to 31 is not
   used, 32 to 127 is US-ASCII [<a href="#ref-US-ASCII">US-ASCII</a>], 127 is not unused, and the
   remaining code positions 128 to 255 represent single-byte or multi-
   byte graphic characters structured according to ISO 2022 [<a href="#ref-ISO-2022" title='"Information technology -- Character code structure and extension techniques"'>ISO-2022</a>]
   or are unused.

   The coded character set SHALL be one of the ones registered with IANA
   [IANA] and SHALL be identified by the jobCodedCharSet attribute in
   the jmJobAttributeTable for the job.  If the agent does not know what
   coded character set was used by the job submitting client, the agent
   SHALL either (1) return the 'unknown(2)' value for the
   jobCodedCharSet attribute or (2) not return the jobCodedCharSet
   attribute for the job.

   Examples of coded character sets which meet this criteria for use as
   the value of the jobCodedCharSet job attribute are: US-ASCII [US-
   ASCII], ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) [<a href="#ref-ISO-8859-1" title='"Information technology -- 8-bit single byte coded graphic character sets - Part 1: Latin alphabet No. 1'>ISO-8859-1</a>], any ISO 8859-n, HP Roman8,
   IBM Code Page 850, Windows Default 8-bit set, UTF-8 [<a href="#ref-UTF-8" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>UTF-8</a>], US-ASCII
   plus JIS X0208-1990 Japanese [JIS X0208], US-ASCII plus GB2312-1980
   PRC Chinese [<a href="#ref-GB2312">GB2312</a>].  See the IANA registry of coded character sets
   [IANA charsets].

   Examples of coded character sets which do not meet this criteria are:
   national 7-bit sets conforming to ISO 646 (except US-ASCII), EBCDIC,
   and ISO 10646 (Unicode) [<a href="#ref-ISO-10646" title='"Information technology -- Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set (UCS) - Part 1: Architecture and Basic Multilingual Plane'>ISO-10646</a>].  In order to represent Unicode
   characters, the UTF-8 [<a href="#ref-UTF-8" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>UTF-8</a>] encoding scheme SHALL be used which has
   been assigned the MIBenum value of '106' by IANA.

   The jobCodedCharSet attribute uses the imported 'CodedCharSet'
   textual-convention from the Printer MIB [printmib].

   The natural language for attributes represented by the textual-
   convention JmJobStringTC is identified either (1) by the
   jobNaturalLanguageTag(9) attribute or is keywords in US-English (as
   in IPP).  A monitoring application SHOULD attempt to localize
   keywords into the language of the user by means of some lookup
   mechanism.  If the keyword value is not known to the monitoring
   application, the monitoring application SHOULD assume that the value
   is in the natural language specified by the job's
   jobNaturalLanguageTag(9) attribute and SHOULD present the value to
   its user as is.  The jobNaturalLanguageTag(9) attribute value SHALL
   have the same syntax and semantics as the
   processingMessageNaturalLangTag(7) attribute, except that the
   jobNaturalLanguageTag(9) attribute identifies the natural language of

   This MIB does not require any additional registration schemes for
   IANA, but does depend on registration schemes that other Internet
   standards track specifications have set up.  The names of these IANA
   registration assignments under the /in-notes/iana/assignments/ path:

   1.printer-language-numbers - used as enums in the documentFormat(38)
       attribute

   2.media-types - uses as keywords in the documentFormat(38) attribute

   3.character-sets - used as enums in the jobCodedCharSet(8) attribute

   The Printer Working Group (PWG) will handle registration of
   additional enums after approving this standard, according to the
   procedures described in this section:

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.7.1%20PWG%20Registration%20of%20enums"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.7.1" name="section-3.7.1">3.7.1</a> PWG Registration of enums</span>

   This specification uses textual conventions to define enumerated
   values (enums) and bit values.  Enumerations (enums) and bit values
   are sets of symbolic values defined for use with one or more objects
   or attributes.  All enumeration sets and bit value sets are assigned
   a symbolic data type name (textual convention).  As a convention the
   symbolic name ends in "TC" for textual convention.  These
   enumerations are defined at the beginning of the MIB module
   specification.

   The PWG has defined several type of enumerations for use in the Job
   Monitoring MIB and the Printer MIB [<a href="#ref-print-mib" title='"Printer MIB"'>print-mib</a>].  These types differ
   in the method employed to control the addition of new enumerations.
   Throughout this document, references to "type n enum", where n can be
   1, 2 or 3 can be found in the various tables.  The definitions of
   these types of enumerations are:

   These textual-conventions are defined as bits in an Integer so that
   they can be used with SNMPv1 SMI.  The jobStateReasonsN (N=1..4)
   attributes are defined as bit values using the corresponding
   JmJobStateReasonsNTC textual-conventions.

   The registration of JmJobServiceTypesTC and JmJobStateReasonsNTC bit
   values follow the procedures for a type 2 enum as specified in
   <a href="#section-3.7.1.2">Section 3.7.1.2</a>.

   In addition to enums and bit values, this specification assigns a
   single ASCII digit or letter to various job submission ID formats.
   See the JmJobSubmissionIDTypeTC textual-convention and the  object.
   The registration of JobSubmissionID format numbers follows the

   The documentFormat(38) attribute has MIME type/sub-type values for

   All objects are read-only, greatly simplifying the security
   considerations.  If another MIB augments this MIB, that MIB might
   accept SNMP Write operations to objects in that MIB whose effect is
   to modify the values of read-only objects in this MIB.  However, that
   MIB SHALL have to support the required access control in order to
   achieve security, not this MIB.

   The security policy of some sites MAY be that unprivileged users can
   only get the objects from jobs that they submitted, plus a few
   minimal objects from other jobs, such as the
   jmJobKOctetsPerCopyRequested and jmJobKOctetsProcessed objects, so
   that a user can tell how busy a printer is.  Other sites MAY allow
   all unprivileged users to see all objects of all jobs.  This MIB does
   not require, nor does it specify how, such restrictions would be
   implemented.  A monitoring application SHOULD enforce the site
   security policy with respect to returning information to an
   unprivileged end user that is using the monitoring application to
   monitor jobs that do not belong to that user, i.e., the jmJobOwner
   object in the jmJobTable does not match the user's user name.

   An operator is a privileged user that would be able to see all
   objects of all jobs, independent of the policy for unprivileged
   users.

   This MIB does not specify any notifications.  For simplicity,
   management applications are expected to poll for status.  The
   jmGeneralJobPersistence and jmGeneralAttributePersistence objects
   assist an application to determine the polling rate.  The resulting
   network traffic is not expected to be significant.

        NOTE - JmTimeStampTC is defined in units of seconds, rather
        than 100ths of seconds, so as to be simpler for agents to
        implement (even if they have to implement the 100ths of a
        second to comply with implementing sysUpTime in MIB-II[mib-
        II].)

        NOTE - JmTimeStampTC is defined as an Integer32 so that it can
        be used as a value of an attribute, i.e., as a value of the
        jmAttributeValueAsInteger object.  The TimeStamp textual-
        convention defined in SNMPv2-TC [<a href="#ref-SMIv2-TC" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>SMIv2-TC</a>] is defined as an
        APPLICATION 3 IMPLICIT INTEGER tag, not an Integer32 which is
        defined in SNMPv2-SMI [<a href="#ref-SMIv2-TC" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>SMIv2-TC</a>] as UNIVERSAL 2 IMPLICIT

            One or more of:

            1.  the job is using, or is attempting to use, one or
            more purely software processes that are analyzing,
            creating, or interpreting a PDL, etc.,

            2.  the job is using, or is attempting to use, one or
            more hardware devices that are interpreting a PDL,
            making mark on a medium, and/or performing finishing,
            such as stapling, etc.,  OR

            3. (configuration 2) the server has made the job ready
            for printing, but the output device is not yet printing
            it, either because the job hasn't reached the output
            device or because the job is queued in the output
            device or some other spooler, awaiting the output
            device to print it.

            When the job is in the processing state, the entire job
            state includes the detailed status represented in the
            device MIB indicated by the hrDeviceIndex value of the
            job's physicalDevice attribute, if the agent implements
            such a device MIB.

            Implementations MAY, though they NEED NOT, include

            additional values in the job's jmJobStateReasons1 object
            to indicate the progress of the job, such as adding the
            jobPrinting value to indicate when the device is actually
            making marks on a medium and/or the processingToStopPoint
            value to indicate that the server or device is in the
            process of canceling or aborting the job.

        processingStopped(6),
            The job has stopped while processing for any number of
            reasons and will return to the processing state as soon
            as the reasons are no longer present.

            The job's jmJobStateReasons1 object and/or the job's
            jobStateReasonsN (N=2..4) attributes MAY indicate why the
            job has stopped processing.  For example, if the output
            device is stopped, the deviceStopped value MAY be
            included in the job's jmJobStateReasons1 object.

            NOTE - When an output device is stopped, the device
            usually indicates its condition in human readable form
            at the device.  The management application can obtain
             more complete device status remotely by querying the
            appropriate device MIB using the job's deviceIndex
            attribute(s), if the agent implements such a device MIB

        canceled(7),
            A client has canceled the job and the server or device
            has completed canceling the job AND all MIB objects and
            attributes have reached their final values for the job.
            While the server or device is canceling the job, the
            job's jmJobStateReasons1 object SHOULD contain the
            processingToStopPoint value and one of the
            canceledByUser, canceledByOperator, or canceledAtDevice
            values.  The canceledByUser, canceledByOperator, or
            canceledAtDevice values remain while the job is in the
            canceled state.

        aborted(8),
            The job has been aborted by the system, usually while the
            job was in the processing or processingStopped state and
            the server or device has completed aborting the job AND
            all MIB objects and attributes have reached their final
            values for the job.  While the server or device is
            aborting the job, the job's jmJobStateReasons1 object MAY
            contain the processingToStopPoint and abortedBySystem
            values.  If implemented, the abortedBySystem value SHALL
            remain while the job is in the aborted state.

            The job has completed successfully or with warnings or

        this case, three bits would be set in the jobServiceTypes
        attribute, corresponding to the hexadecimal values: 0x8 + 0x20
        + 0x4, respectively, yielding: 0x2C.

        Whether this attribute is set from a job attribute supplied by
        the job submission client or is set by the recipient job
        submission server or device depends on the job submission
        protocol.  With either implementation, the agent SHALL return a
        non-zero value for this attribute indicating the type of the
        job.

        One of the purposes of this attribute is to permit a requester
        to filter out jobs that are not of interest.  For example, a
        printer operator MAY only be interested in jobs that include
        printing.  That is why the attribute is in the job
        identification category.

        The following service component types are defined (in
        hexadecimal) and are assigned a separate bit value for use with
        the jobServiceTypes attribute:

        other                             0x1
            The job contains some instructions that are not one of the

            The job contains some instructions whose type is unknown to

            The job contains some instructions that specify printing

        scan                              0x8

        Depending on the enum definition, this object value MAY be an
        integer, a counter, an index, or an enum, depending on the
        jmAttributeTypeIndex value.  The units of this value are
        specified in the enum description.

        For those attributes that are accumulating job consumption as
        the job is processed as specified in the JmAttributeTypeTC
        textual-convention, SHALL contain the final value after the job
        completes processing, i.e., this value SHALL indicate the total
        usage of this resource made by the job.

        A monitoring application is able to copy this value to a
        suitable longer term storage for later processing as part of an
        accounting system.

        Since the agent MAY add attributes representing resources to
        this table while the job is waiting to be processed or being
        processed, which can be a long time before any of the resources
        are actually used, the agent SHALL set the value of the

        Attributes for which the concept of an integer value is
        meaningless, such as fileName(34), jobName, and
        processingMessage, do not have the 'INTEGER:' tag in the
        JmAttributeTypeTC definition and so an agent SHALL always
        return a value of '-1' to indicate 'other' for the value of the
        jmAttributeValueAsInteger object for these attributes.

        For attributes which do have the 'INTEGER:' tag in the

   The job object has well-defined states and client operations that
   affect the transition between the job states.  Internal server and
   device actions also affect the transitions of the job between the job
   states.  These states and transitions are referred to as the job's
   life cycle.

   Not all implementations of job submission protocols have all of the
   states of the job model specified here.  The job model specified here
   is intended to be a superset of most implementations.  It is the
   purpose of the agent to map the particular implementation's job life
   cycle onto the one specified here.  The agent MAY omit any states not
   implemented.  Only the processing and completed states are required
   to be implemented by an agent.  However, a conforming management
   application SHALL be prepared to accept any of the states in the job
   life cycle specified here, so that the management application can
   interoperate with any conforming agent.

   The job states are intended to be user visible.  The agent SHALL make
   these states visible in the MIB, but only for the subset of job
   states that the implementation has.  Some implementations MAY need to
   have sub-states of these user-visible states.  The jmJobStateReasons1
   object and the jobStateReasonsN (N=2..4) attributes can be used to
   represent the sub-states of the jobs.

   Job states are intended to last a user-visible length of time in most
   implementations.  However, some jobs may pass through some states in
   zero time in some situations and/or in some implementations.

   The job model does not specify how accounting and auditing is
   implemented, except to assume that accounting and auditing logs are
   separate from the job life cycle and last longer than job entries in
   the MIB.  Jobs in the completed, aborted, or canceled states are not
   logs, since jobs in these states are accessible via SNMP protocol
   operations and SHALL be removed from the Job Monitoring MIB tables
   after a site-settable or implementation-defined period of time.  An
   accounting application MAY copy accounting information incrementally
   to an accounting log as a job processes, or MAY be copied while the
   job is in the canceled, aborted, or completed states, depending on
   implementation.  The same is true for auditing logs.

   The jmJobState object specifies the standard job states.  The normal
   job state transitions are shown in the state transition diagram
   presented in Figure 4.

   A companion PWG document, entitled "Job Submission Protocol Mapping
   Recommendations for the Job Monitoring MIB" [<a href="#ref-protomap" title='"Job Submission Protocol Mapping Recommendations for the Job Monitoring MIB"'>protomap</a>] contains the
   recommended usage of each of the objects and attributes in this MIB
   with a number of job submission protocols.  In particular, which job
   submission ID format should be used is indicated for each job
   submission protocol.

   Some job submission protocols have support for the client to specify
   a job submission ID.  A second approach is to enhance the document
   format to embed the job submission ID in the document data.  This
   second approach is independent of the job submission protocol.  This
   appendix lists some examples of these approaches.

   Some PJL implementations wrap a banner page as a PJL job around a job
   submitted by a client.  If this results in multiple job submission
   IDs, the agent SHALL create multiple jmJobIDEntry rows in the
   jmJobIDTable that each point to the same job entry in the job tables.
   See the specification of the jmJobIDEntry.
