Status of This Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
   not specify an Internet standard.  Distribution of this memo is
   unlimited.

Introduction

   This memo is being distributed to members of the Internet community
   to fully document an Apple protocol that may be running over the
   Internet.  While the issues discussed may not be directly relevant to
   the research problems of the Internet, they may be interesting to a
   number of researchers and implementers.

About This Document

   This document provides detailed information about the AppleTalk
   Update-based Routing Protocol (AURP) and wide area routing. AURP
   provides wide area routing enhancements to the AppleTalk routing
   protocols and is fully compatible with AppleTalk Phase 2. The
   organization of this document has as its basis the three major
   components of AURP:

      AppleTalk tunneling, which allows AppleTalk data to pass through
      foreign networks and over point-to-point links

      the propagation of AppleTalk routing information between internet
      routers connected through foreign networks or over point-to-point
      links

      the presentation of AppleTalk network information by an internet
      router to nodes and other Phase 2-compatible routers on its local
      internet

What This Document Contains

   The chapters of this document contain the following information:

      Chapter 1, "Introduction to the AppleTalk Update-Based Routing
      Protocol," introduces the three major components of AURP and the



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                     [Page 1]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-2" id="page-2" name="page-2"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


      key wide area routing enhancements that AURP provides to the
      AppleTalk routing protocols.

      Chapter 2, "Wide Area AppleTalk Connectivity," provides
      information about AppleTalk tunneling through IP internets and over
      point-to-point links.

      Chapter 3, "Propagating Routing Information With the AppleTalk
      Update-Based Routing Protocol," describes the essential elements of
      AURP, including the architectural model for update-based routing.
      This chapter provides detailed information about the methods that
      AURP uses to propagate routing information between internet routers
      connected through tunnels.

      Chapter 4, "Representing Wide Area Network Information," describes
      optional features of AURP-some of which can also be implemented on
      routers that use RTMP rather than AURP for routing-information
      propagation. It gives detailed information about how an exterior
      router represents imported network information to its local
      internet and to other exterior routers. It describes network
      hiding, device hiding, network-number remapping, clustering, loop
      detection, hop-count reduction, hop-count weighting, and backup
      paths.

      The Appendix, "Implementation Details," provides information about
      implementing AURP.

What You Need to Know

   This document is intended for developers of AppleTalk wide area
   routing products. It assumes familiarity with the AppleTalk network
   system, internet routing, and wide area networking terms and
   concepts.

   The AppleTalk Update-based Routing Protocol (AURP) provides wide area
   routing enhancements to the AppleTalk routing protocols and is fully
   compatible with AppleTalk Phase 2. AURP consists of three major
   components:

      AppleTalk tunneling through foreign network systems-for example,
      TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and over
      point-to-point links

      the propagation of routing information between internet routers
      connected through foreign network systems or over point-to-point
      links

      the presentation of AppleTalk network information by an internet
      router to nodes or to other Phase 2-compatible routers on its local
      internet-in other words, on the AppleTalk internet connected
      directly to the router

   Chapter 3, "Propagating Routing Information With the AppleTalk
   Update-Based Routing Protocol," describes the elements of AURP that
   are essential for a minimal implementation of AURP. AURP includes
   many optional features for the presentation of network information.
   You can implement many of these optional features on routers that use
   either AURP or RTMP (Routing Table Maintenance Protocol) for
   routing-information propagation.

   Figure 1-1 shows how the three major components of AURP interact.

                 &lt;&lt;Figure 1-1  Major components of AURP&gt;&gt;

   Wide Area Routing Enhancements Provided by AURP

   AURP provides AppleTalk Phase 2-compatible routing for large wide
   area networks (WANs). Key wide area routing enhancements provided by
   AURP include:

      tunneling through TCP/IP internets and other foreign network
      systems

      point-to-point tunneling

      basic security-including device hiding and network hiding

      remapping of remote network numbers to resolve numbering conflicts

   This chapter describes the wide area connectivity capabilities
   provided by the AppleTalk Update-based Routing Protocol (AURP),
   including:

      AppleTalk tunneling

      tunneling through TCP/IP internets

      tunneling over point-to-point links

   AppleTalk Tunneling

   Tunneling allows a network administrator to connect two or more
   native internets through a foreign network system to form a large
   wide area network (WAN). For example, an AppleTalk WAN might consist
   of two or more native AppleTalk internets connected through a tunnel
   built on a TCP/IP internet. In such an AppleTalk WAN, native
   internets use AppleTalk protocols, while the foreign network system
   uses a different protocol family.

   A tunnel connecting AppleTalk internets functions as a single,
   virtual data link between the internets. A tunnel can be either a
   foreign network system or a point-to-point link. Figure 2-1 shows an
   AppleTalk tunnel.

                     &lt;&lt;Figure 2-1  AppleTalk tunnel&gt;&gt;

   There are two types of tunnels:

      dual-endpoint tunnels, which have only two routers on a tunnel-for
      example, point-to-point tunnels

      multiple-endpoint tunnels-herein referred to as multipoint tunnels-
      which have two or more routers on a tunnel

   AURP implements multipoint tunneling by providing mechanisms for data
   encapsulation and the propagation of routing information to specific
   routers.

   Exterior Routers

   An AppleTalk router with a port that connects an AppleTalk internet
   to a tunnel is an exterior router. An exterior router always sends
   split-horizoned routing information to the other exterior routers on
   a multipoint tunnel. That is, an exterior router on a multipoint
   tunnel sends routing information for only its local internet to other
   exterior routers on that tunnel. An exterior router never exports
   routing information obtained from other exterior routers on the
   tunnel, because the exterior routers communicate their own routing
   information to one another.

   As shown in Figure 2-2, the absence or presence of redundant paths,
   or loops, across a tunnel changes the way an exterior router defines
   its local internet. For more information about redundant paths, see
   the section "Redundant Paths" in Chapter 4. If no loops exist across
   a tunnel, an exterior router's local internet comprises all networks
   connected directly or indirectly to other ports on the exterior
   router.  When loops exist across a tunnel, an exterior router's local
   internet comprises only those networks for which the next internet
   router is not across a tunnel. Using this definition of a local
   internet, two exterior routers' local internets might overlap if
   loops existed across a tunnel.  For more information about routing
   loops, see the section "Routing Loops" in Chapter 4.

            &lt;&lt;Figure 2-2  An exterior router's local internet&gt;&gt;

   An exterior router functions as an AppleTalk router within its local
   internet and as an end node in the foreign network system connecting
   AppleTalk internets. An exterior router uses RTMP to communicate
   routing information to its local internet, and uses AURP and the
   network-layer protocol of the tunnel's underlying foreign network
   system to communicate with other exterior routers connected to the
   tunnel. An exterior router encapsulates AppleTalk data packets using
   the headers required by the foreign network system, then forwards the
   packets to another exterior router connected to the tunnel.

   FORWARDING DATA: When forwarding AppleTalk data packets across a
   multipoint tunnel, an exterior router

      encapsulates the AppleTalk data packets in the packets of the
      tunnel's underlying foreign network system by adding the headers
      required by that network system

      adds an AURP-specific header-called a domain header-immediately
      preceding each AppleTalk data packet





<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                     [Page 8]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-9" id="page-9" name="page-9"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   A domain header contains additional addressing information-including
   a source domain identifier and destination domain identifier. For
   more information about domain headers, see the sections "AppleTalk
   Data-Packet Format" and "AppleTalk Data-Packet Format for IP
   Tunneling" later in this chapter. For detailed information about
   domain identifiers, see the section "Domain Identifiers" later in
   this chapter.

   Before forwarding a data packet to a network in another exterior
   router's local internet, an exterior router must obtain the foreign-
   protocol address of the exterior router that is the next internet
   router in the path to the packet's destination network. The exterior
   router then sends the packet to that exterior router's foreign-
   protocol address using the network-layer protocol of the foreign
   network system. The exterior router need not know anything further
   about how the packet traverses this virtual data link.

   Once the destination exterior router receives the packet, it removes
   the headers required by the foreign network system and the domain
   header, then forwards the packet to its destination in the local
   AppleTalk internet.

   If the length of an AppleTalk data packet in bytes is greater than
   that of the data field of a foreign-protocol packet, a forwarding
   exterior router must fragment the AppleTalk data packet into multiple
   foreign-protocol packets, then forward these packets to their
   destination. Once the destination exterior router receives all of the
   fragments that make up the AppleTalk data packet, it reassembles the
   packet.

   CONNECTING MULTIPLE TUNNELS TO AN EXTERIOR ROUTER: An exterior router
   can also connect two or more multipoint tunnels. As shown in Figure
   2-3, when an exterior router connects more than one multipoint
   tunnel, the tunnels can be built on any of the following:

      the same foreign network system

      different foreign network systems

      similar, but distinct foreign network systems

     &lt;&lt;Figure 2-3  Connecting multiple tunnels to an exterior router&gt;&gt;

   Whether the tunnels connected to an exterior router are built on
   similar or different foreign network systems, each tunnel acts as an
   independent, virtual data link. As shown in Figure 2-4, an exterior
   router connected to multiple tunnels functions logically as though it
   were two or more exterior routers connected to the same AppleTalk

   network, with each exterior router connected to a different tunnel.

     &lt;&lt;Figure 2-4  An exterior router connected to multiple tunnels&gt;&gt;

   Fully Connected and Partially Connected Tunnels

   An AppleTalk multipoint tunnel functions as a virtual data link. AURP
   assumes full connectivity across a multipoint tunnel-that is, all
   exterior routers on such a tunnel can communicate with one another.
   An exterior router always sends split-horizoned routing information
   to other exterior routers on a multipoint tunnel. That is, an
   exterior router on a multipoint tunnel sends routing information for
   only its local internet to other exterior routers on that tunnel. An
   exterior router never exports routing information obtained from other
   exterior routers on the tunnel, because exterior routers communicate
   their routing information to one another.

   If all exterior routers connected to a multipoint tunnel are aware of
   and can send packets to one another, that tunnel is fully connected.
   If some of the exterior routers on a multipoint tunnel are not aware
   of one another, the tunnel is only partially connected. Figure 2-5
   shows examples of a fully connected tunnel, a partially connected
   tunnel, and two fully connected tunnels.

      &lt;&lt;Figure 2-5  Fully connected and partially connected tunnels&gt;&gt;

   In the second example shown in Figure 2-5, the network administrator
   may have connected the tunnel partially for one of these reasons:

      to prevent the local internets connected to exterior routers A and
      C from communicating with one another, while providing full
      connectivity between the local internets connected to exterior
      router

      B and the local internets connected to both exterior routers A and
      C

      because local internets connected to exterior routers A and C need
      access only to local internets connected to exterior router B-not
      to each other's local internets

      because exterior routers A and C-which should be aware of one
      another-were misconfigured

   Generally, an exterior router cannot determine whether a multipoint
   tunnel is fully connected or partially connected. In the second
   example in Figure 2-5, exterior router B does not know whether
   exterior routers A and C are aware of one another. However, exterior



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 10]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   router B must assume that the tunnel is fully connected, and that
   exterior routers A and C can exchange routing information. An
   exterior router should never forward routing information received
   from other exterior routers back across the tunnel. It should always
   send split-horizoned routing information to other exterior routers.

   If connecting exterior routers A and C directly would be either
   expensive or slow, a network administrator could instead establish
   two independent multipoint tunnels-one connecting exterior routers A
   and B, another connecting exterior routers B and C-as shown in the
   third example in Figure 2-5. Exterior routers A and C could then
   establish connectivity by routing all data packets forwarded by one
   to the other through exterior router B.

   Hiding Local Networks From Tunnels

   When configuring a tunneling port on an exterior router, a network
   administrator can provide network-level security to a network in the
   exterior router's local internet by hiding that network. Hiding a
   specific network in the exterior router's local internet prevents
   internets across a multipoint tunnel from becoming aware of the
   presence of that network. When the exterior router exchanges routing
   information with other exterior routers connected to the tunnel, it
   exports no information about any hidden networks to the exterior
   routers from which the networks are hidden.

   An administrator can specify that certain networks in the exterior
   router's local internet be hidden from a specific exterior router
   connected to the tunnel or from all exterior routers on the tunnel.

   Nodes on the local internet of an exterior router from which a
   network is hidden cannot access that network. Neither the zones on a
   hidden network nor the names of devices in those zones appear in the
   Chooser on computers connected to such an internet. When a network is
   hidden, its nodes are also unable to access internets from which the
   network is hidden. If a node on a hidden network sends a packet
   across a tunnel to a node on an internet from which it is hidden,
   even if the packet arrives at its destination, the receiving node
   cannot respond. The exterior router connected to the receiving node's
   internet does not know the return path to the node on the hidden
   network. Thus, it appears to the node on the hidden network that the
   node to which it sent the packet is inaccessible.

   ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF NETWORK HIDING: Network hiding
   provides the following advantages:

      On large, global WANs, a network administrator can configure
      network-level security for an organization's internets.



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 11]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-12" id="page-12" name="page-12"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>



      It reduces the amount of network traffic across both a tunnel and
      the internets connected to that tunnel.

   Network hiding has the following disadvantages:

      Nodes on hidden networks have limited access to internets across a
      tunnel.

      AppleTalk networking software running on a node on a hidden network
      lists all of the AppleTalk zone names exported by exterior routers
      connected to a tunnel, but may list the names of only some or none
      of the devices in those zones. It cannot list the names of devices
      that are unable to respond to Name Binding Protocol (NBP) lookups
      originating from a node on a hidden network.

   Domain Identifiers

   Exterior routers assign a unique domain identifier to each AppleTalk
   internet, or domain. Domain identifiers enable exterior routers on a
   multipoint tunnel to distinguish individual AppleTalk internets in a
   wide area internet from one another.

   The definition of an AppleTalk domain identifier is extensible to
   allow for future use when many additional types of AppleTalk tunnels
   and tunneling topologies may exist:

      Under the current version of AURP, each exterior router connected
      to a multipoint tunnel assigns a domain identifier to its local
      AppleTalk internet that uniquely identifies that internet on the
      tunnel. If redundant paths connect an AppleTalk internet through
      more than one exterior router on a tunnel, each exterior router can
      assign a different domain identifier to that internet, or AppleTalk
      domain, as shown in Figure 2-6.

      Under future routing protocols, a domain identifier will define the
      boundaries of an AppleTalk domain globally-for all exterior
      routers.  Thus, a domain identifier will be unique among all
      domains in a wide area internet. All exterior routers within a wide
      area internet will use the same domain identifier for a given
      AppleTalk internet, as shown in Figure 2-6.

                    &lt;&lt;Figure 2-6  Domain identifiers&gt;&gt;

   To simplify an exterior router's port configuration, a parameter that
   is already administrated-such as a node address-can serve as the
   basis for an exterior router's domain identifier.

   GENERAL DOMAIN-IDENTIFIER FORMAT: Figure 2-7 shows the general form
   of a domain identifier.

             &lt;&lt;Figure 2-7  General domain-identifier format&gt;&gt;

   The general domain identifier (DI) consists of the following fields:

   Length:  Byte 1 represents the length of the DI in bytes, not
   including the length byte. A DI must consist of an even number of
   bytes. Thus, the length byte is always an odd-numbered byte. The
   length field permits tunneling through foreign network systems that
   have addresses of any length-including the long addresses
   characteristic of X.25 and OSI. The value of the length byte varies,
   depending on the format of the DI.

   Authority:  Byte 2 indicates the authority that administrates the
   identifier bytes of the DI. At present, Apple has defined only two
   authority-byte values:

      $01-indicates that the subsequent bytes correspond to a unique,
      centrally administrated IP address

      $00-the null DI-indicates that no additional bytes follow

   All other authority-byte values are reserved and should not be used.

   Identifier:  The identifier field starts at byte 3 and consists of a
   variable number of bytes of the type indicated by the authority byte.

   NULL DOMAIN-IDENTIFIER FORMAT: The use of a null domain identifier is
   appropriate only when there is no need to distinguish the domains
   connected to a tunnel-for example, where a tunnel exists within a
   single internet-or for a point-to-point link. Figure 2-8 shows the
   null form of a domain identifier.

               &lt;&lt;Figure 2-8  Null domain-identifier format&gt;&gt;

   A null domain identifier consists of the following bytes:

   Length:  Byte 1 contains the value $01, defining the length of the
   null DI as one byte.

   Authority:  Byte 2 contains the value $00, indicating a null DI.

   AppleTalk Data-Packet Format

   Part of the format of an AppleTalk data packet sent across a
   multipoint tunnel or a point-to-point link depends on the underlying

   foreign network system. The headers required by a foreign-network
   protocol always precede an AppleTalk data packet sent across a
   multipoint tunnel.  A domain header generally immediately precedes
   the AppleTalk data packet. Figure 2-9 shows the format of an
   AppleTalk data packet preceded by a domain header.

     &lt;&lt;Figure 2-9  AppleTalk data-packet format with a domain header&gt;&gt;

   A domain header consists of the following fields:

   Destination DI:  The length of the destination DI field in bytes
   depends on the type of DI.

   Source DI:  The length of the source DI field in bytes depends on the
   type of DI.

   Version number:  The version number field is two bytes in length and
   currently contains the value 0001.

   Reserved:  The two-byte field that follows the version number field
   is reserved for future use and is set to 0000.

   Packet type:  The two-byte packet type field contains the value 0002
   to identify the data that follows as AppleTalk data-distinguishing it
   from other data, such as routing data. In the future, Apple may
   define other values for this field.

   An AppleTalk data packet does not require a domain header if

      it is sent across a multipoint tunnel or point-to-point link that
      provides separate channels for data and routing packets

      the domain header's destination DI and source DI fields would both
      contain null DIs

   Omitting a domain header reduces overhead associated with the
   exchange of routing information, without any loss of routing
   information. Figure 2-10 shows the format of an AppleTalk data packet
   without a domain header.

   &lt;&lt;Figure 2-10  AppleTalk data-packet format without a domain header&gt;&gt;

   IP Tunneling

   The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol
   suite is a widely used communications standard that provides
   interoperability among computers from various vendors, including
   Apple, IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation, Sun, and Hewlett-Packard.



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 14]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   Descriptions of three of the most important TCP/IP protocols follow:

      The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport-layer
      protocol that provides reliable data transmission between
      processes-that is, between programs that communicate with one
      another. This connection-oriented, byte-stream protocol ensures
      error-free, sequential data delivery, without loss or duplication.

      The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a transport-layer protocol
      that provides best-effort, low-overhead interprocess data
      transmission.  This datagram-oriented protocol allows higher-layer
      protocols that do not require reliability to transmit data without
      incurring the overhead associated with TCP. UDP does no error
      checking, does not acknowledge its successful receipt of data,
      and does not sequence incoming messages. UDP messages may be lost,
      duplicated, or improperly sequenced.

      The Internet Protocol (IP) is a network-layer protocol that
      provides connectionless, best-effort datagram delivery across
      multiple networks. Each host on a TCP/IP network has a unique,
      centrally administrated internet address, called an IP address,
      that identifies the node. The header of an IP datagram contains its
      source and destination IP addresses, allowing any host to route a
      datagram to its destination. TCP/IP provides connectivity between
      many different network types that use data frames of various sizes.
      Therefore, IP can fragment a datagram before sending it across an
      internet.  Datagram fragments can fit into data frames of any size.
      Once all of a datagram's fragments reach their destination, IP
      reassembles the datagram.

   Protocols in higher layers pass data to TCP or UDP for delivery to
   peer processes. TCP and UDP encapsulate the data in segments, using
   the appropriate headers, then pass the segments to IP. IP further
   encapsulates the data in IP datagrams, determines each datagram's
   path to its destination, and sends the datagrams across the internet.

   Figure 2-11 shows how the TCP/IP family of protocols conforms to the
   Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.

         &lt;&lt;Figure 2-11  TCP/IP protocol stack and the OSI model&gt;&gt;

   Exterior routers that connect AppleTalk internets through a TCP/IP
   tunnel are configured as nodes on both an AppleTalk internet and on
   the TCP/IP internet. Thus, an exterior router on a TCP/IP tunnel is
   also an IP end node in the TCP/IP network system. Exterior routers
   use the TCP/IP internet only to exchange AppleTalk routing
   information and AppleTalk data packets with one another. An exterior
   router encapsulates AppleTalk data packets in IP datagrams before



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 15]</span></pre>

   sending them across the TCP/IP internet to a forwarding exterior
   router, which decapsulates the packets, then forwards them to their
   destination AppleTalk networks.

   IP Domain-Identifier Format

   Under the current version of AURP, exterior routers on IP tunnels
   must use domain identifiers that are based on IP addresses. An
   exterior router on an IP tunnel derives its domain identifier from
   its IP address. Thus, a network administrator does not need to
   configure an exterior router's domain identifier. Figure 2-12 shows
   the IP form of a domain identifier.

               &lt;&lt;Figure 2-12  IP domain-identifier format&gt;&gt;

   An IP domain identifier consists of the following fields:

   Length:  Byte 1 contains the value $07, defining the length of the IP
   DI as seven bytes.

   Authority:  Byte 2 contains the value $01, indicating that the
   remainder of the DI is based on an IP address.

   Distinguisher:  Bytes 3 and 4 are reserved for future use and are set
   to 0 ($00).

   IP address:  Bytes 5 through 8 contain the four-byte IP address of
   either the sending or the receiving exterior router.

   NOTE:  Future versions of AURP will allow exterior routers to
   usealternative formats for domain identifiers, even on IP tunnels.

   AppleTalk Data-Packet Format for IP Tunneling

   The following protocol headers precede an AppleTalk data packet that
   is forwarded across an IP tunnel by an exterior router:

      a data-link header

      an IP header

      a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) header

      a domain header

   An exterior router encapsulates AppleTalk data packets in UDP packets
   when forwarding them through its UDP port 387, across an IP tunnel,
   to UDP port 387 on another exterior router. When encapsulating data



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 16]</span></pre>

   packets, an exterior router should always use UDP checksums. When a
   destination exterior router receives the UDP packets at UDP port 387,
   it decapsulates the packets.

   A domain header consists of the following fields:

   Destination DI:  This field contains the DI of the exterior router to
   which a packet is being forwarded.

   Source DI:  This field contains the DI of the exterior router that is
   forwarding a packet.

   Version number:  The version number field is two bytes in length and
   currently contains the value 0001.

   Reserved:  The two-byte field that follows the version number field
   is reserved for future use and is set to 0000.

   Packet type:  The two-byte packet type field contains the value 0002
   to identify the data that follows as AppleTalk data-distinguishing it
   from other data, such as routing data.

   An AppleTalk data packet consists of a domain header and AppleTalk
   data.  Figure 2-13 shows the format of an AppleTalk data packet
   forwarded across an IP tunnel.

   &lt;&lt;Figure 2-13  AppleTalk data packet forwarded across an IP tunnel&gt;&gt;

   Point-to-Point Tunneling

   In point-to-point tunneling, two remote AppleTalk local area networks
   (LANs) connected to half-routers communicate with one another over a
   point-to-point link. A point-to-point link may consist of modems
   communicating over a standard telephone line or a leased line, such
   as a T1 line. Figure 2-14 shows an example of point-to-point
   tunneling.

                 &lt;&lt;Figure 2-14  Point-to-point tunneling&gt;&gt;

   Generally, exterior routers use null domain identifiers on point-to-
   point links, because there is no IP address to be administrated and
   the opposite end of the tunnel is already uniquely identified.
   However, an exterior router may use other domain-identifier formats.

   Point-to-Point Protocol

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data-link-layer protocol that
   provides a standard method of encapsulating and decapsulating



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 17]</span></pre>

   network-layer protocol information, and transmitting that information
   over point-to-point links. PPP includes an extensible Link Control
   Protocol (LCP) and a suite of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) that
   configure, enable, and disable various network-layer protocols.

   The AppleTalk Control Protocol (ATCP) is a PPP NCP for AppleTalk
   protocols. ATCP configures, enables, and disables the AppleTalk
   network-layer protocol DDP on the half-router at each end of a
   point-to-point link. ATCP also specifies the protocol that a half-
   router uses to propagate routing information-for example, AURP.  When
   using AURP for routing-information propagation, a half-router uses a
   specific PPP protocol type to identify AURP routing-information
   packets-that is, packets preceded by a domain header. PPP provides
   separate channels for AppleTalk data packets and AppleTalk routing-
   information packets. Thus, a half-router can use DDP encapsulation to
   send AppleTalk data packets without including their domain headers.
   When using AURP, a half-router should accept both AppleTalk data
   packets that are preceded by domain headers and DDP-encapsulated
   packets.

   NOTE:  The Request for Comments (RFC) <a href="rfc1378.html">1378</a>, "The PPP AppleTalk
   Control Protocol (ATCP)," provides a detailed specification of ATCP,
   as well as information about using PPP to send AppleTalk data.

   AURP Architectural Model

   AURP provides the functionality of the Routing Table Maintenance
   Protocol (RTMP) and the Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) while
   eliminating most of the routing traffic generated by these protocols.
   Figure 3-1 shows the architectural model for AURP.

                 &lt;&lt;Figure 3-1  AURP architectural model&gt;&gt;

   Generally, an AppleTalk router uses RTMP and ZIP to maintain routing
   information, and sends RTMP data packets, ZIP Queries, and ZIP
   Replies out its ports. However, if one of the router's ports is
   connected to an AppleTalk tunnel, the architectural model for the
   router's central routing module becomes more complex. Logically, the
   central routing module in an exterior router communicates RTMP and
   ZIP information to an RTMP/ZIP-to-AURP conversion module, which sends
   AURP data packets out the tunneling port.

   RTMP/ZIP-to-AURP Conversion Module

   The RTMP/ZIP-to-AURP conversion module maintains split-horizoned
   routing-table information and network number-to-zone name mappings
   for each exterior router on the tunnel-that is, a copy of the routing
   information for each exterior router's local internet. Figure 3-2
   shows the architectural components of the RTMP/ZIP-to-AURP conversion
   module.

      &lt;&lt;Figure 3-2  RTMP/ZIP-to-AURP conversion module architecture&gt;&gt;

   The AURP module of the conversion module obtains routing information
   from the other exterior routers on the tunnel, then periodically
   updates the routing-table information and the mappings in the
   conversion module.  The RTMP module passes this routing-table
   information to the exterior router's central routing module.
   Logically, the RTMP module generates an RTMP data packet for each
   exterior router on the tunnel every ten seconds-the RTMP
   retransmission time-then passes the packet to the central routing
   module.

   The RTMP/ZIP-to-AURP conversion module also maintains a split-
   horizoned copy of the routing information maintained by the exterior
   router in which it resides. Logically, the conversion module obtains
   the routing information from RTMP data packets and ZIP Replies sent
   by the exterior router's central routing module, then updates the
   routing information in the conversion module.




<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 19]</span></pre>

   The AURP module exports routing information about its local AppleTalk
   internet to other exterior routers on the tunnel.

   AURP Transport Layering

   AURP can propagate routing information between exterior routers using

      a simple, reliable transport based on an underlying datagram
      service-such as the default transport-layer service for AURP,
      AURP-Tr. See the section "AURP-Tr," later in this chapter,
      for more information.

      a more complex transport-layer service-such as TCP

   Figure 3-3 shows the AURP transport-layering model.

               &lt;&lt;Figure 3-3  AURP transport-layering model&gt;&gt;

   Maintaining Current Routing Information With AURP

   AURP allows exterior routers to maintain current routing information
   for other exterior routers on a tunnel by supporting

      the reliable, initial exchange of split-horizoned routing
      information - that is, the routing information for an exterior
      router's local internet

      reliable updates to that information whenever it changes

   If an internet topology does not change, AURP generates significantly
   less routing traffic than RTMP and ZIP. Thus, an administrator can
   connect very large AppleTalk internets through a tunnel, and the
   resulting internet generates little or no routing traffic on the
   tunnel.

   When an exterior router discovers another exterior router on the
   tunnel-that is, a peer exterior router-it can request that exterior
   router to send its routing information. In a reliable, initial
   exchange of split-horizoned routing information, the peer exterior
   router returns its network-number list. The peer exterior router also
   returns each connected network's zone information in an unsequenced
   series of zone-information packets. If the exterior router requesting
   the routing information does not receive complete zone information
   for a network, it must retransmit requests for zone information until
   it receives the information.

   Once an exterior router requesting routing information from a peer
   exterior router has received that exterior router's network-number



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 20]</span></pre>

   list and complete zone information, it typically requests the peer
   exterior router to notify it of any changes to that routing
   information. The peer exterior router then provides the requesting
   exterior router with reliable updates to its routing information-
   however, it sends no other routing information.

   Notifying Other Exterior Routers of Events

   If an exterior router has requested notification of changes in
   another exterior router's split-horizoned routing information, that
   exterior router must notify the requesting exterior router of any
   event that changes its routing information. Thus, an exterior router
   must send updated routing information to the requesting exterior
   router whenever any of the following events occur:

      the addition of a new, exported network-that is, a network that is
      not hidden-to the exterior router's local internet and,
      consequently, to its routing table

      a change in the path to an exported network that causes the
      exterior router to access that network through its local internet
      rather than through a tunneling port

      the removal of an exported network from the exterior router's
      routing table because a network in the exterior router's local
      internet has gone down

      a change in the path to an exported network that causes the
      exterior router to access that network through a tunneling port
      rather than through its local internet

      a change in the distance to an exported network

      a change to a zone name in the zone list of an exported network-
      an event not currently supported by ZIP or the current version of
      AURP

      the exterior router goes down or is shut down

   Routing-information updates allow an exterior router to maintain
   accurate, split-horizoned routing information for a peer exterior
   router on a tunnel.

   AURP-Tr

   AURP-Tr, the default transport-layer service for AURP, provides a
   simple, reliable transport that is based on an underlying datagram
   service. When using AURP-Tr, only one sequenced transaction can be



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 21]</span></pre>

   outstanding, or unacknowledged, at a time-greatly simplifying the
   implementation of AURP, without limiting its functionality.

   One-Way Connections

   A one-way connection is an asymmetrical link between a data sender
   and a data receiver that are using AURP-Tr, in which an exterior
   router functioning as a data sender sends a sequenced, reliable,
   unidirectional data stream to an exterior router functioning as a
   data receiver.  An exterior router can send routing information over
   a one-way connection as

      sequenced data

      transaction data

   Sequenced data is data sent in sequence by the data sender and
   delivered reliably to the data receiver. Typically, the sending of
   sequenced data is unprovoked-that is, it is not requested by a data
   receiver. However, a data receiver can request sequenced data. Figure
   3-4 shows sequenced data being sent across a one-way connection.

          &lt;&lt;Figure 3-4  Sequenced data on a one-way connection&gt;&gt;

   Transaction data-also referred to as out-of-band data-is data sent
   unsequenced by the data sender through a linked request/response
   transaction that is initiated by the data receiver.

   The data receiver can use a one-way connection to request transaction
   data from the data sender. If the data receiver does not receive a
   response, it must retransmit its request. Figure 3-5 shows a one-way
   connection on which the data receiver requests transaction data from
   the data sender.

   &lt;&lt;Figure 3-5  Request for transaction data on a one-way connection&gt;&gt;

   Generally, communication between two exterior routers is
   bidirectional-that is, two one-way connections exist between the
   exterior routers, with each exterior router acting as the data sender
   on one connection and the data receiver on the other. Thus, each
   exterior router can send its routing information to the other.

   Initial Information Exchange

   When an AppleTalk exterior router discovers another exterior router
   on the tunnel, it uses the underlying transport-layer service to open
   a connection with that exterior router. When using AURP-Tr, an
   exterior router opens this connection as a one-way connection.

   Open Request Packet

   Once the data receiver opens a connection using the underlying
   transport, the data receiver sends an Open Request packet, or Open-
   Req, to the data sender. An Open-Req packet includes the following
   information:

   Send update information flags:  The states of the four send update
   information (SUI) flags indicate whether the data sender should send
   various types of update information over the connection. Typically,
   the four SUI flags are set to 1.

   Version number:  The version number field indicates the version of
   AURP used by the data receiver. The current version number of AURP is
   1.

   Data field:  The optional data field allows exterior routers with
   capabilities beyond those described in this document to notify other
   exterior routers about such options, by initiating option
   negotiation.  An exterior router that has similar capabilities
   indicates that it accepts the options, completing option negotiation.
   An exterior router that lacks such options ignores the information in
   the data field.

   Open Response Packet

   When an exterior router receives an Open-Req, it becomes the data
   sender and responds with an Open Response packet, or Open-Rsp, as
   follows:

      If the exterior router accepts the connection, it returns
      information about its setup in the Open-Rsp. An Open-Rsp also
      contains an optional data field. This data field indicates whether
      the exterior router accepts the options in the data field of the
      Open-Req to which it is responding.

      If the exterior router cannot accept the connection-for example,
      because the Open-Req does not contain the correct version number-it
      returns an error in the Open-Rsp and closes the transport-layer
      connection.

   Figure 3-6 shows a connection-opening dialog between a data sender
   and a data receiver.

   Routing Information Request Packet

   Under AURP, once two exterior routers establish a connection, the
   data receiver can request the data sender to send its routing
   information by sending it a Routing Information Request packet, or
   RI-Req.

   Routing Information Response Packets

   When the data sender receives an RI-Req, it reliably sends a sequence
   of Routing Information Response packets, or RI-Rsp, to the exterior
   router requesting the information.

   The RI-Rsp packets provide a list of exported networks on the data
   sender's local internet and the distance of each network from the
   data sender. The data sender must finish sending RI-Rsp packets to
   the exterior router requesting routing information before it can send
   any other sequenced data over the connection. Figure 3-7 shows a
   routing-information request/response dialog between a data sender and
   a data receiver.

        &lt;&lt;Figure 3-7  Routing-information request/response dialog&gt;&gt;

   Zone Information Request Packet

   The data receiver can obtain zone information for known networks on
   the data sender's local internet at any time, by sending it a Zone
   Information Request packet, or ZI-Req. A ZI-Req lists the numbers of
   networks for which the data receiver is requesting zone information.

   IMPORTANT: To prevent other exterior routers on a tunnel from sending
   endless streams of ZI-Req packets across the tunnel-causing what is
   referred to as a ZIP storm-an exterior router must not export
   information about a network until it has a complete zone list for
   that network.

   Zone Information Response Packets

   When the data sender receives a ZI-Req, it responds by sending
   unsequenced Zone Information Response packets, or ZI-Rsp, to the data
   receiver. Zone information is transaction data-thus, its reliable
   delivery is not guaranteed. Figure 3-8 shows a zone-information
   request/response dialog between a data sender and a data receiver.

         &lt;&lt;Figure 3-8  Zone-information request/response dialog&gt;&gt;

   Recovering Lost Zone Information

   A data receiver enters a network-to-zone list association in its
   routing table for each network for which it receives a ZI-Rsp packet.
   If a data receiver that requested zone information for a network does
   not receive a complete zone list for that network, it must retransmit
   ZI-Req packets, requesting zone information for that network, until
   it receives that network's complete zone information.

   To determine if any ZI-Rsp packets were lost, the data receiver
   periodically scans its routing table for networks for which the
   associated zone lists are incomplete-that is, for zone lists that do
   not include all zones associated with the networks. The data receiver
   sends a ZI-Req to each data sender from which it received incomplete
   zone information, listing the numbers of networks for which it has
   incomplete zone lists. The data sender responds to zone information
   requests by sending ZI-Rsp packets containing the requested
   information to the data receiver.

   Using AURP-Tr for Initial Information Exchange

   The following sections describe the use of AURP-Tr-the default
   transport-layer service for AURP-for initial information exchange.

   OPEN REQUEST PACKET: An exterior router sends an Open-Req packet to

      request that an AURP-Tr one-way connection with another exterior
      router be established

      specify the connection ID for that connection

      pass the AURP version number, SUI flags, and optional data to the
      other exterior router

   If the exterior router does not receive an Open-Rsp from the exterior
   router to which it sent an Open-Req, it must retransmit the Open-Req.

   OPEN RESPONSE PACKET: When using AURP-Tr, an exterior router sends an
   Open-Rsp to

      acknowledge that a one-way connection has been established

      reject a connection

      return information about its environment, as well as any optional
      data, to the exterior router from which it received an Open-Req





<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 25]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   If an exterior router receives an Open-Req on a one-way connection
   that is already open-that is, if it receives an Open-Req with the
   same connection ID as an open one-way connection-an Open-Rsp sent
   previously may have been lost. The exterior router receiving the
   duplicate Open-Req should send a duplicate Open-Rsp to the sending
   exterior router, unless it has already received some other packet on
   the connection-such as an RI-Req-indicating the existence of a fully
   established connection.

   ROUTING INFORMATION RESPONSE PACKETS: When responding to a request
   for routing information using AURP-Tr, an exterior router sends a
   sequence of RI-Rsp packets to the exterior router requesting the
   information.  However, an exterior router's complete list of network
   numbers often fits in a single RI-Rsp packet. Each RI-Rsp packet
   contains the following information:

   Connection ID:  The connection ID identifies the specific one-way
   connection to which a packet belongs.

   Sequence number:  The sequence number identifies an individual packet
   on a connection. Packets on a connection are numbered starting with
   the number 1.

   The data sender sending routing information must wait for the data
   receiver to acknowledge that it has received each RI-Rsp packet in
   the sequence-by sending an RI-Ack packet-before sending the next RI-
   Rsp packet. Each RI-Rsp contains a flag that indicates whether it is
   the last packet in the sequence. In the last RI-Rsp in the sequence,
   this flag is set to 1. If the data sender receives no acknowledgment
   of an RI-Rsp from the data receiver within a specified period of
   time, it must retransmit the RI-Rsp.

   ROUTING INFORMATION RESPONSE PACKETS: When an exterior router
   receives an RI-Rsp, it verifies the packet's connection ID and
   sequence number.  The connection ID must be the same as that in the
   Open-Req. The sequence number must be either

      the last sequence number received, indicating that the previous
      acknowledgment was lost or delayed, and that this is a duplicate
      RI-Rsp the next number in the sequence, indicating that this
      RI-Rsp contains new routing information

   If the connection ID or sequence number is invalid, the data receiver
   discards the packet. Figure 3-9 shows a dialog between a data sender
   and a data receiver in which the data receiver requests routing
   information, the data sender responds by sending its routing
   information, and the data receiver acknowledges the data sender's
   response. If the data sender receives no acknowledgment, it sends

   duplicate RI-Rsp packets until the data receiver responds with an
   acknowledgment.

     &lt;&lt;Figure 3-9 Routing-information request/response/acknowledgment
                                 dialog&gt;&gt;

   Once the data receiver has verified the information in the RI-Rsp, it
   responds with a Routing Information Acknowledgment packet, or RI-Ack,
   which contains the following information:

   Connection ID:  The connection ID is the same as that in the RI-Rsp
   packet.

   Sequence number:  The sequence number is the same as that in the RI-
   Rsp packet.

   Send zone information flag:  The state of the send zone information
   (SZI) flag in an RI-Ack packet indicates whether the RI-Ack packet
   doubles as a ZI-Req packet. If the SZI flag is set to 1, the data
   receiver sends the zone information associated with the networks
   about which it sent routing information in the previous RI-Rsp.

   Figure 3-10 shows a data receiver sending zone information to a data
   sender in response to a ZI-Req and in response to an RI-Ack, which
   optimizes the data flow.

   When the data sender receives an RI-Ack, it verifies that the RI-Ack
   corresponds to the outstanding RI-Rsp-that is, both packets have the
   same connection ID and sequence number. Once the data sender has
   verified the information in the RI-Ack, it responds by sending the
   next RI-Rsp in the sequence, if any.

   &lt;&lt;Figure 3-10  Nonoptimized and optimized flows of zone information&gt;&gt;

   ZONE INFORMATION RESPONSE PACKETS: If the data sender receives an
   RI-Ack with its SZI flag set to 1, it responds by sending ZI-Rsp
   packets that contain the zone information associated with the
   networks about which it sent routing information in the RI-Rsp being
   acknowledged-just as it would if it received a ZI-Req for those
   networks.

   The data sender sends RI-Rsp and ZI-Rsp packets as independent data
   streams. It sends RI-Rsp packets as sequenced data and ZI-Rsp packets
   as transaction data. If the data sender receives an RI-Ack with its
   SZI flag set to 1, it sends an unsequenced series of ZI-Rsp packets
   that contain the following information:

   Connection ID:  The connection ID is the same as that in the

   associated RI-Req.

   Network number and zone list tuples: The exterior router sends the
   zone information associated with each network number in the
   corresponding RI-Rsp.

   Reobtaining Routing Information

   An exterior router can reobtain another exterior router's complete
   routing information at any time, by sending an RI-Req packet. An
   exterior router might need to reobtain complete routing information
   for a one-way connection on which it is the data receiver under the
   following circumstances:

      During the initial routing-information exchange, the exterior
      router set the SUI flags in the Open-Req to disable updates. The
      exterior router can subsequently poll the other exterior router on
      the connection by sending an RI-Req to that exterior router to
      determine whether any of its routing information has changed.

      The exterior router set the SUI flags to request updates, but
      suspects that the routing information for the other exterior router
      on the connection is incorrect or obsolete. The exterior router
      should send an RI-Req to the other exterior router to obtain its
      complete, updated routing information.

   Whenever an exterior router receives an RI-Req from an exterior
   router requesting updated routing information, it responds by sending
   RI-Rsp packets, just as it does when it first receives an RI-Req. The
   data sender also resets the SUI flags for that one-way connection, so
   they correspond to those in the RI-Req.

   If the data sender is sending other sequenced update information when
   it receives an RI-Req, it cannot respond to the RI-Req until the data
   receiver acknowledges the last outstanding packet in the sequence.
   If AURP uses an underlying transport-layer service that does not
   provide reliable delivery, such as AURP-Tr, it may be necessary for
   the data receiver to retransmit an RI-Req.

   Updating Routing Information

   Once an exterior router receives the routing and zone information for
   another exterior router's local internet, if the receiving exterior
   router has set the SUI flags in the Open-Req to request updates, the
   data sender notifies the data receiver of any subsequent changes to
   that information.

   Informed-Routers List

   An exterior router maintains an informed-routers list containing the
   network address of each exterior router that has requested dynamic
   updating of routing information. Once an exterior router has sent
   routing information for its local internet to other exterior routers
   on the tunnel, it must reliably send updated routing information to
   all accessible exterior routers in its informed-routers list whenever
   its routing information changes.

   Sending Routing Information Update Packets

   An exterior router communicates changes in its routing information by
   sending Routing Information Update, or RI-Upd, packets to another
   exterior router. When the routing information for an exterior
   router's local internet changes, the exterior router need not send an
   RI-Upd immediately. Generally, an exterior router buffers the update
   information, then sends updates periodically. The exterior router
   must wait at least an update interval between sending updates. The
   value of this update interval

      cannot be less than ten seconds

      should be specifiable by a network administrator

   It is possible that more than one update event for a particular
   network might occur within one update interval. One of these events
   might supercede another-for example, a Network Added event followed
   by a Network Deleted event for the same network. In this case, the
   exterior router can represent the two events logically as one event.
   Under AURP, an exterior router can have only one event pending for a
   given network.  An exterior router can combine any series of events
   for a network into a single pending event. In Figure 3-11, a state
   diagram shows the update event that an exterior router should have
   pending for a network, based on the other events that have occurred
   during the update interval.

      &lt;&lt;Figure 3-11  A state diagram showing pending update events&gt;&gt;

   Four of the states correspond to four pending update events. Two
   states indicate that no update event is pending:

      Net Up-indicates that no update event is pending for a network
      in the exterior router's local internet

      Net Down-indicates that no update event is pending for a network in
      another exterior router's local internet or the network does not
      exist



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 29]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>



   A single RI-Upd packet may contain different types of update events-
   for example, several Network Added events and several Network Deleted
   events. For information about update events, see the section
   "Routing-Information Update Events" later in this chapter.

   A data sender should send an RI-Upd packet to an exterior router in
   its informed-routers list only if the packet contains one or more
   update events of a type indicated by the SUI flags of the last Open-
   Req or RI-Req received from that exterior router. Because an RI-Upd
   that contains one or more events of a type requested by an exterior
   router may also contain events of types not requested, an exterior
   router must be able to handle events of all types. Thus, a data
   sender can send an RI-Upd that contains various types of update
   events to all exterior routers that have requested update events of
   any of those types.

   Sending Updates Following the Initial Exchange of Routing Information

   While a data sender has update events pending-that is, when update
   events have occurred but the data sender has not yet sent RI-Upd
   packets for those events-another exterior router may establish a new
   connection with the data sender. The data sender must present
   consistent routing information to all exterior routers on the tunnel,
   on both existing connections and any new connections. For example, if
   a pending update event indicated that a new network had become
   available, the newly connected exterior router could be informed of
   that network's presence on the internet either by

      sending it an RI-Rsp packet including routing information for the
      new network

      sending it an RI-Rsp packet that does not include routing
      information for the new network, then sending it the RI-Upd packet
      that includes the pending update event

   AURP does not specify a scheme for sending update information
   following the initial exchange of routing information on a new
   connection.  However, the Appendix, "Implementation Details,"
   describes one possible method of doing this.

   Using AURP-Tr to Update Routing Information

   The following sections describe the use of AURP-Tr for sending
   routing-information updates.

   ROUTING INFORMATION UPDATE PACKETS: Each RI-Upd packet contains the
   following information:



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 30]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-31" id="page-31" name="page-31"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   Connection ID:  The connection ID identifies the specific one-way
   connection to which the RI-Upd belongs.

   Sequence number:  The sequence number identifies an individual RI-Upd
   on a connection.

   If an update cannot be contained in one RI-Upd packet, the data
   sender must send a sequence of RI-Upd packets. While the data sender
   need not wait for the duration of an update interval before sending
   each RI-Upd packet in a sequence, it must wait for the data receiver
   to acknowledge that it has received the RI-Upd packet that is
   currently outstanding before sending the next RI-Upd packet in the
   sequence.

   If the data sender sending an RI-Upd does not receive an
   acknowledgment, or RI-Ack, from the data receiver within a specified
   period of time, the data sender should periodically retransmit the
   RI-Upd until it receives an acknowledgment from the data receiver.
   Once the data sender retransmits the RI-Upd a specified number of
   times, if it does not receive an RI-Ack, it should assume that the
   one-way connection on which it is the data sender is down. For more
   information about routers going down, see the section "Using AURP-Tr
   to Detect Routers Going Down" later in this chapter.

   ROUTING INFORMATION ACKNOWLEDGMENT PACKET: When a data receiver
   receives an RI-Upd, it verifies the packet's connection ID and
   sequence number.  The connection ID must be the same as that in the
   Open-Req for the connection. The sequence number must be either:

      the last sequence number received, indicating that the previous
      acknowledgment was lost or delayed, and that this is a duplicate
      RI-Upd

      the next number in the sequence, indicating that the RI-Upd
      contains new routing information

   If the sequence number has any other value, the data receiver ignores
   the RI-Upd. Once the data receiver has verified the RI-Upd packet's
   connection ID and sequence number, it responds by sending a Routing
   Information Acknowledgment packet, or RI-Ack, which contains the
   following information:

   Connection ID:  The connection ID is the same as that in the RI-Upd
   packet.

   Sequence number:  The sequence number is the same as that in the RI-
   Upd packet.

   Figure 3-12 shows a data receiver responding to an RI-Upd by sending
   an RI-Ack.

    &lt;&lt;Figure 3-12  A routing-information update/acknowledgment dialog&gt;&gt;

   When a data sender receives an RI-Ack, it verifies that the RI-Ack
   corresponds to the outstanding RI-Upd-that is, both packets have the
   same connection ID and sequence number. Once the data sender has
   verified the information in the RI-Ack, it responds by sending the
   next RI-Upd in the sequence, if any.

   Routing-Information Update Events

   An RI-Upd packet may contain any of five different types of routing-
   information update events. The following sections describe these
   events.

   NETWORK ADDED EVENT: An exterior router sends a Network Added (NA)
   event under the following circumstances:

      A new network that appears in the exterior router's routing table
      is in the exterior router's local internet and is not hidden-that
      is, it is an exported network.

      The port through which an exterior router accesses a network
      changes from a tunneling port to another port on the router
      and the network is not hidden.

   If a network in an exterior router's routing table becomes accessible
   across the tunnel, the exterior router does not send an NA event. An
   exterior router sends only split-horizoned routing information to
   other exterior routers on the tunnel.

   An NA event lists the network numbers associated with the new network
   and the network's distance in hops. Another exterior router can
   request the zone information associated with the new network at any
   time by sending a ZI-Req, once it receives an RI-Upd containing an NA
   event for the network.

   When using AURP-Tr, an exterior router can request zone information
   for new networks by setting the SZI bit in an RI-Ack that it sends in
   response to an RI-Upd. If a data sender receives an RI-Ack with its
   SZI flag set to 1, the data sender sends the zone information
   associated with each new network for which it sent an NA event in the
   RI-Upd.

   Figure 3-13 shows a data receiver responding to an RI-Upd by sending
   an RI-Ack in which the SZI bit is set to 1, optimizing the flow of

   zone information by causing the data sender to respond with a ZI-Rsp.

          &lt;&lt;Figure 3-13  An optimized flow of zone information&gt;&gt;

   NETWORK DELETED EVENT: An exterior router sends a Network Deleted
   (ND) event if an exported network that was formerly accessible
   through its local internet no longer appears in its routing table. An
   ND event lists the network numbers associated with the deleted
   network.

   NETWORK ROUTE CHANGE EVENT: An exterior router sends a Network Route
   Change (NRC) event if the path to an exported network through its
   local internet changes to a path through a tunneling port, causing
   split-horizoned processing to eliminate that network's routing
   information. An NRC event lists the network numbers associated with
   the network to which the path changed.

   NETWORK DISTANCE CHANGE EVENT: An exterior router sends a Network
   Distance Change (NDC) event if the distance to an exported network
   accessible through its local internet changes. An NDC event indicates
   the network to which the distance changed and the network's distance
   in hops. An exterior router must send an NDC event even if the
   distance to a network changes to 15 hops. The exterior router that
   receives an NDC event with a hop count of 15 should process that
   event just as it would an ND event.

   ZONE NAME CHANGE EVENT: This event is reserved for future use.

   Processing Update Events

   According to the architectural model, a data receiver that is
   processing an event contained in an RI-Upd packet updates the
   corresponding information in its central routing table. For example,
   if a data receiver receives an RI-Upd containing an ND event or an
   NRC event, it sets the corresponding network's routing-table entry to
   BAD. The data receiver then initiates a notify-neighbor process, by
   sending RTMP data packets that identify bad entries in its routing
   table to routers on its local internet.

   Processing Inconsistent Update Events

   If the data receiver's copy of the data sender's routing table does
   not match that in the data sender's current routing table, it is
   possible that the data receiver might receive an RI-Upd containing an
   event that is incongruous with its current routing-table information.
   For example, this might occur if the information in the data sender's

   "Sending Updates Following the Initial Exchange of Routing
   Information" earlier in this chapter. The data receiver might receive
   an RI-Upd that contains an ND, NRC, or NDC event for a network not
   known to be in the data sender's routing table; or an NA event for a
   network already known to be in its routing table. The data receiver
   should

      ignore ND and NRC events for unknown networks

      process an NDC event for an unknown network as an NA event

      process an NA event for a known network as an NDC event

   Maintaining a Central Routing Table

   According to the architectural model, an exterior router maintains a
   separate routing table for each other exterior router on a tunnel. In
   a typical implementation, however, an exterior router maintains a
   central routing table that contains information about each path to
   each network known to that exterior router-including its port, next
   internet router (IR), and distance in hops.

   If no loops exist across a tunnel, an exterior router can reach a
   network that is accessible through that tunnel through only one
   exterior router, as shown in Figure 3-14. Such a network is
   accessible neither through the exterior router's local internet nor
   through any other exterior router on the tunnel. Thus, the central
   routing table would contain only one path for that network.

   If a loop exists across a tunnel, an exterior router may be able to
   access a network through two or more exterior routers on the tunnel,
   or through both its local internet and an exterior router. Thus, when
   a loop exists across a tunnel, the central routing table may contain
   more than one path for each network. Figure 3-14 shows two examples
   of internets on which loops exist.

             &lt;&lt;Figure 3-14  Internets with and without loops&gt;&gt;

   Maintaining an Alternative-Paths List

   If a loop exists across a tunnel and an exterior router maintains a
   single central routing table, that table must include an
   alternative-paths list for each network known to the exterior router.
   This alternative-paths list contains the routing information that an
   exterior router might otherwise maintain in separate routing tables
   for the other exterior routers on a tunnel. An entry for each
   alternative path to a network consists of the address of the
   alternative next IR for that network and the network's distance



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 34]</span></pre>

   through that next IR.

   Because RTMP periodically retransmits information about alternative
   paths, the exterior router's alternative-paths list needs to provide
   information only about alternative paths to networks across tunneling
   ports. Thus, the alternative-paths list for a network provides
   complete information about all paths to that network across tunnels-
   but not necessarily about all paths through the exterior router's
   local internet.

   An exterior router must maintain an alternative-paths list, because
   once a data sender has reliably sent routing information to a data
   receiver, the data sender does not retransmit that information. Even
   though a path may not currently be the optimal path to a network, an
   exterior router must maintain information about that path, in the
   event that it later becomes the optimal path.

   NOTE:  Zone information is unaffected by the path taken to a network.
   Therefore, an exterior router need not maintain duplicate zone
   information in the alternative-paths list.

   Using the Alternative-Paths List in Event Processing

   An exterior router uses its alternative-paths list when processing
   events.

   PROCESSING A NETWORK ADDED EVENT: If an exterior router receives an
   NA event, it searches its central routing table for the network
   indicated in the event.

      If the exterior router finds no entry for that network in its
      central routing table, it creates a new entry using the routing
      information contained in the NA event.

      If the exterior router finds an existing entry for that network in
      its central routing table and the next IR for that entry is not
      the exterior router that sent the event, it determines whether the
      NA event provides a better path to that network.

         If the NA event provides a better path to the network or the
         state of the routing-table entry for that network is BAD, the
         exterior router replaces the current entry with the routing
         information contained in the NA event. In the current entry, if
         the path to the network is through a tunnel, as indicated by
         the next IR, the exterior router transfers the current entry to
         the network's alternative-paths list.

         If the NA event does not provide a better path to the network,



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 35]</span></pre>

         the exterior router adds the routing information contained in
         the NA event to the alternative-paths list for the network.

      If the exterior router finds an existing entry for that network,
      in which the next IR is the exterior router that sent the event,
      the exterior router should process the NA event just as it would
      an NDC event.

   PROCESSING A NETWORK DELETED EVENT:  If an exterior router receives
   an ND event, it searches its central routing table for the network
   indicated in the event.

      If the exterior router finds no entry for that network in its
      central routing table, it ignores the event. See the section
      "Processing Inconsistent Update Events" earlier in this chapter.

      If the exterior router that is the data receiver determines that
      the exterior router that sent the ND event is the next IR for that
      network and there is an alternative-paths list for the network, the
      data receiver replaces the network's current routing information
      with the entry in the network's alternative-paths list that
      provides the shortest distance to that network and removes that
      entry from the network's alternative-paths list. If the network's
      alternative-paths list contains more than one entry providing the
      distance that constitutes the shortest distance to the network, the
      data receiver can use any of those entries.

      If the exterior router that is the data receiver determines that
      the exterior router that sent the ND event is the next IR for that
      network and there is no alternative-paths list for the network, the
      data receiver sets the network's routing-table entry to BAD, then
      initiates a notify-neighbor process.

      If the exterior router that is the data receiver determines that
      the exterior router that sent the ND event is not the next IR for
      that network, the data receiver searches that network's
      alternative-paths list for an entry in which the next IR is the
      data sender and removes that entry from the list.

   PROCESSING A NETWORK ROUTE CHANGE EVENT: If an exterior router
   receives an NRC event, it processes that event as an ND event.
   Generally, an NRC event should not cause an exterior router to set
   the state of a network's routing-table entry to BAD. An NRC event
   indicates that the data sender has an alternative path to the network
   through the tunnel.  The data receiver either is already aware of or
   will soon discover this alternative path.





<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 36]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   PROCESSING A NETWORK DISTANCE CHANGE EVENT: If an exterior router
   receives an NDC event with a hop count of 15, it processes that event
   just as it would an ND event. Otherwise, it searches its central
   routing table for the network indicated in the event.

      If the exterior router finds no entry for that network in its
      central routing table, it processes that event as an NA event.

      If the exterior router that is the data receiver determines that
      the exterior router that sent the NDC event is the next IR for the
      network, the data receiver replaces the distance to that network
      that is currently in its central routing table with the distance
      indicated in the NDC event.

      If the exterior router that is the data receiver determines that
      the exterior router that sent the NDC event is not the next IR for
      the network, the data receiver

      replaces the distance in the corresponding entry in the network's
      alternative-paths list with the distance indicated in the NDC event
      creates an entry in the alternative-paths list that contains the
      routing information in the NDC event, if it finds no entry for that
      network in the alternative-paths list

   Finally, regardless of whether the central routing table indicates
   that the exterior router that sent the NDC event is the network's
   next IR, the data receiver compares the distances in entries in the
   network's alternative-paths list to the distance in its central
   routing table. If an entry in the alternative-paths list contains a
   shorter path to the network, the exterior router transfers that entry
   to the central routing table. This ensures that the exterior router's
   central routing table contains the shortest path to the network.

      If the data receiver replaces the entry currently in its central
      routing table with that in the NDC event and the current entry
      provides a path to the network through a tunnel, the data receiver
      transfers the current entry to the network's alternative-paths
      list.

      If the data receiver transfers an entry in the network's
      alternative-paths list to its central routing table, it removes
      that entry from the alternative-paths list.

   RESPONDING TO EVENTS IN THE LOCAL INTERNET: An exterior router that
   uses AURP must respond appropriately to events that originate in its
   local internet. Such events occur when the routing information for a
   network in the exterior router's local internet changes and another
   path to that network exists through the tunnel. An exterior router



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 37]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-38" id="page-38" name="page-38"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   handles such events as follows:

      If the exterior router replaces the current routing-table entry for
      a network with routing information provided by an event originating
      in its local internet-that is, provided by RTMP-and the current
      path to the network is through a tunnel, the exterior router
      transfers the current entry to the network's alternative-paths
      list.

      If the exterior router sets the state of a routing-table entry to
      BAD or removes an entry from its central routing table, the
      exterior router replaces that entry with the entry in the
      alternative-paths list that provides the shortest distance to the
      network in the entry being replaced.

      If the distance to a network in the exterior router's local
      internet changes, the exterior router compares the distances in
      entries in the network's alternative-paths list to the distance in
      its central routing table. If an entry in the alternative-paths
      list provides a shorter distance to the network, the exterior
      router transfers that entry to its central routing table. This
      ensures that the exterior router's central routing table contains
      the shortest path to the network.

   Router-Down Notification

   Prior to going down, or becoming inactive, an exterior router must
   notify all other exterior routers in its informed-routers list that
   it is going down. An exterior router does this by using the
   underlying transport-layer service to close its connection with each
   exterior router.

   Sending a Router Down Packet

   Optionally, an exterior router can send a Router Down packet, or RD
   packet, to each exterior router before it goes down. An RD packet
   contains an error code that indicates the exterior router's reason
   for terminating its connection with each exterior router.

   Generally, only the exterior router functioning as the data sender on
   a one-way connection sends RD packets. However, if just a single
   one-way connection exists between two exterior routers, the exterior
   router functioning as the data receiver on that connection can send
   an RD packet.

   Using AURP-Tr to Notify Other Routers That a Router Is Going Down

   When using AURP-Tr, an exterior router sends an RD packet to



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 38]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


      notify another exterior router that it is terminating a connection

      pass an error code that indicates its reason for terminating the
      connection

   As shown in Figure 3-15, once the data receiver verifies the RD
   packet's connection ID, it acknowledges that it received the RD
   packet by sending an RI-Ack. Then, the data sender terminates the
   connection.

                &lt;&lt;Figure 3-15  Acknowledging an RD packet&gt;&gt;

   If a Router Goes Down Without Notifying Other Routers

   If an exterior router crashes or goes down without sending an RD
   packet, or becomes inaccessible due to a network problem, other
   exterior routers on the tunnel must be able to discover that the
   exterior router is down.  Generally, the underlying transport-layer
   service provides a mechanism for informing an exterior router that an
   exterior router in its informed-routers list has gone down or become
   inaccessible.

   If an exterior router determines that another exterior router is
   down, it must

      remove that exterior router from its informed-routers list

      remove that exterior router's routing information from all of its
      routing tables

      close any one-way connections with that exterior router

   If an exterior router rediscovers an exterior router that had
   previously gone down, it must again exchange initial routing
   information with that exterior router.

   Using AURP-Tr to Detect Routers Going Down

   An exterior router using AURP-Tr associates a last-heard-from timer
   with each exterior router from which it has received routing
   information-that is, with each one-way connection on which it is the
   data receiver. Each time the exterior router receives an RI-Rsp, RI-
   Upd, or ZI-Rsp over a connection-verifying that its connection with
   the data sender is still active-it resets the last-heard-from timer
   for that connection.

   For each one-way connection on which it is the data receiver, the
   exterior router has a last-heard-from timeout value. If a



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 39]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-40" id="page-40" name="page-40"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   connection's last-heard-from timer reaches that timeout value, the
   data receiver sends a Tickle packet over that connection. If the data
   sender on the connection is still accessible, it responds with a
   Tickle-Ack, as shown in Figure 3-16. When the data receiver receives
   the Tickle-Ack, it resets the last-heard-from timer for that
   connection. If the data receiver receives no Tickle-Ack-even after
   retransmitting the Tickle several times-it assumes that the
   connection is down.

              &lt;&lt;Figure 3-16  Acknowledging a Tickle packet&gt;&gt;

   If the exterior router determines that the connection is down and an
   associated one-way connection exists on which it is the data sender,
   it should send a null RI-Upd over that connection to determine
   whether that one-way connection is still active.

   If the data receiver on the connection is still accessible, it
   responds with an RI-Ack, as shown in Figure 3-17. If the data sender
   receives no RI-Ack-even after retransmitting the null RI-Upd several
   times-it determines that the one-way connection on which it is the
   data sender is also down.

              &lt;&lt;Figure 3-17  Acknowledging an RI-Upd packet&gt;&gt;

   The value of the last-heard-from timeout should be configurable. The
   minimum last-heard-from timeout should be 30 seconds. If a
   connection's last-heard-from timeout is greater than two minutes-the
   tickle-before-data time-and the data receiver has not reset the
   connection's last-heard-from timer for at least this tickle-before-
   data time, the data receiver must send a Tickle to the data sender
   before forwarding an AppleTalk data packet to it. If the data sender
   on the connection is still accessible, it responds with a Tickle-Ack.
   When the data receiver receives the Tickle-Ack, it resets the last-
   heard-from timer for that connection. If the data receiver receives
   no Tickle-Ack, even after retransmitting the Tickle, it assumes that
   the data sender is no longer accessible and closes the connection.

   Obtaining Zone Information

   AURP supports two commands that allow an exterior router to obtain
   routing information for zones rather than for networks-the Get Domain
   Zone List (GDZL) command and the Get Zone Nets (GZN) command. These
   commands constitute request/response transactions, and are similar to
   ZI-Req and ZI-Rsp. An exterior router sends these commands
   unsequenced over a connection.

   NOTE:  Under AURP, the implementation of the Get Domain Zone List
   command and the Get Zone Nets command in an exterior router is



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 40]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   optional.  However, an exterior router must at least be able to
   return an error to a GDZL-Req or a GZN-Req.

   Get Domain Zone List Command

   The Get Domain Zone List command, or GDZL, allows an exterior router
   to obtain a zone list for an internet. As shown in Figure 3-18, GDZL
   functions similarly to the ZIP GetZoneList command. However, a GDZL-
   Rsp returns a split-horizoned zone list-that is, it returns only the
   zones in the exterior router's local internet, rather than the
   exterior router's entire zone list. A GDZL-Rsp does not return zones
   in networks that are accessible through the tunnel, unless those
   zones are also in networks that are accessible through the exterior
   router's local internet.

       &lt;&lt;Figure 3-18  Get Domain Zone List request/response dialog&gt;&gt;

   Get Zone Nets Command

   The Get Zone Nets command, or GZN, allows an exterior router to
   obtain a list of the networks in an exterior router's local internet
   that are associated with a particular zone name. As shown in Figure
   3-19, GZN functions similarly to ZI-Req and ZI-Rsp, but a GZN-Req
   packet contains a single zone name and GZN-Rsp packets contain
   network tuples that have the same format as the tuples in an RI-Rsp.
   A GZN-Rsp returns network tuples only for networks that are
   accessible through the exterior router's local internet.

          &lt;&lt;Figure 3-19  Get Zone Nets request/response dialog&gt;&gt;

   Using AURP-Tr to Process Sequence Numbers

   When an exterior router acting as a data receiver sends an Open-Req
   to establish a one-way connection, it expects the data sender to
   respond by sending sequenced data packets, starting with the sequence
   number 1. The data receiver's response to each packet that it
   receives depends on the packet's sequence number:

     Whenever the data receiver receives an RI-Rsp, RI-Upd, or RD packet
     that has the expected sequence number and connection ID, it sends
     an RI-Ack packet having that sequence number, then increases the
     sequence number that it expects by one, until the sequence number
     reaches 65,535. Sequence numbers wrap around and the sequence
     number 0 is reserved, so the sequence number 1 follows 65,535.
     Thus, when comparing sequence numbers, an exterior router
     interprets the sequence number 65,535 as one less than the sequence
     number 1.




<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 41]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


     If the data receiver expects sequence number n and receives a
     packet with the sequence number n-1, that packet was delayed and is
     a duplicate of another packet already received. The data receiver
     must retransmit an RI-Ack packet, because the data sender may not
     have received the RI-Ack packet previously sent-that is, the RI-Ack
     may have been lost.

     If the data receiver expects sequence number n and receives a
     packet with the sequence number n+1, it should discard the packet
     and terminate the one-way connection on which it is the data
     receiver.  Because AURP-Tr supports only one outstanding
     transaction at a time, the receipt of such a packet indicates that
     the connection is out of sync.

     If the data receiver expects sequence number n and receives a
     packet with a sequence number other than n-1, n, or n+1, the packet
     was delayed and is a duplicate of another packet already received.
     The data receiver need not send an RI-Ack, because the data sender
     must have received an RI-Ack for that sequence number prior to
     sending a packet with the sequence number n-1. The data receiver
     should discard the packet.

   NOTE:  If the sequence numbers have not wrapped around, a sequence
   number greater than n+1 indicates that the connection is out of sync.

   Using AURP-Tr to Process Connection IDs

   If an exterior router acting as either a data receiver or a data
   sender on a one-way connection receives a packet from an exterior
   router with which it has a one-way connection, it checks the
   connection ID in the packet to verify that the packet was sent on
   that connection. If the packet contains a connection ID that does not
   match that expected for the connection, the exterior router discards
   the packet.

   If a data sender receives an Open-Req from an exterior router with
   which it already has a connection and the connection ID does not
   match that for the connection already established, it should not
   discard the packet without verifying whether the connection is still
   active. The receipt of such a packet may indicate that the data
   receiver on the connection has been restarted and has opened a new
   one-way connection, without first terminating its original
   connection. The exterior router acting as the data sender should send
   a null RI-Upd over the connection to determine whether it is still
   active. If the data sender receives an RI-Ack in response to the null
   RI-Upd, it discards the Open-Req and the original connection remains
   active. If the data sender receives no RI-Ack after retransmitting
   the null RI-Upd, it closes the original connection, then sends an



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 42]</span></pre>

   Open-Rsp to the next Open-Req received.

   NOTE:  An exterior router can act as the data sender on only a single
   one-way connection between itself and a given exterior router.  That
   is, multiple one-way connections in the same direction cannot exist
   between two exterior routers.

   When establishing a one-way connection with a given data sender, a
   data receiver using AURP-Tr must send an Open-Req that has a
   different connection ID from that used in its last connection with
   the data sender. Otherwise, if the last connection to the data sender
   had terminated abnormally and the new connection used the same
   connection ID, the data sender might determine that the last
   connection was still active and interpret the Open-Req as a
   retransmission of the Open-Req for the last connection. The data
   sender might respond to the Open-Req by sending an Open-Rsp or ignore
   the Open-Req, but would not open a new connection.

   If a data receiver's implementation of AURP-Tr cannot guarantee the
   use of different connection IDs on successive connections with a
   given data sender, the data receiver must send an RI-Req immediately
   after it establishes a connection with a data sender. If the data
   sender already has a connection with the data receiver, it will send
   an RI-Rsp with a sequence number other than 1. The data receiver
   should then terminate that connection and open a new connection using
   a different connection ID.

   Using Retransmission Timers Under AURP-Tr

   When an AppleTalk tunnel exists through a foreign network's internet,
   the delay and loss characteristics of the tunnel's underlying foreign
   network system complicate the setting of retransmission timers. A
   physical connection can be built between two exterior routers using
   different media-for example, a single Ethernet LAN, a fast point-to-
   point link, an IP internet, or a slow link over an asynchronous
   modem.  It is important to minimize performance degradation due to

      packets being dropped or delayed by the underlying foreign network
      system

      the inefficient use of the underlying foreign network system's
      resources due to excessive retransmissions

   Most higher-level transport-layer services provide guaranteed packet
   delivery. It is not necessary to retransmit AURP packets when using
   such transport-layer services. When using AURP-Tr, an exterior router
   should employ an adaptive retransmission algorithm whenever possible.
   An adaptive retransmission strategy like that used in TCP



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 43]</span></pre>

      maintains the estimated times required to send a packet and receive
      an acknowledgment-that is, average round-trip times

      maintains standard deviations from the average round-trip times

      derives retransmission timers from the average round-trip times
      While AURP does not specify an adaptive retransmission algorithm,
      the use of such an algorithm is recommended.

   NOTE:  Often, long intervals exist between AURP packets sent
   successively on a connection by an exterior router-for example,
   between RI-Upd packets. Therefore, an adaptive retransmission
   algorithm used with AURP should give more weight to packets sent
   recently over a connection than would be appropriate for a general
   data-stream protocol like TCP.

   When an exterior router initially opens a connection, no transaction
   history is available. It is recommended that the retransmission
   algorithm use a truncated, exponential backoff scheme for the initial
   Open-Req sequence, because the exterior router with which the data
   receiver is establishing a connection may be inaccessible or down. An
   exterior router should not retransmit an Open-Req at a rate faster
   than once every two seconds.

   Hiding Local Networks From Remote Networks

   As described in the section "Hiding Local Networks From Tunnels" in
   Chapter 2, a network administrator can configure an exterior router
   to hide specific networks in its local internet from networks
   connected to other exterior routers on the tunnel. When exchanging
   routing information with other exterior routers on the tunnel, the
   exterior router exports no routing information for hidden networks in
   its local internet to exterior routers from which those networks are
   hidden.

   An exterior router using AURP does not include routing information
   for hidden networks in RI-Rsp, RI-Upd, or GZN-Rsp packets sent to
   exterior routers from which those networks are hidden. The exterior
   router also excludes from GDZL-Rsp packets any zones that appear only
   in the zone lists of hidden networks.

   To maintain network-level security, an exterior router should discard
   any AppleTalk data packet sent to a network in its local internet by
   an exterior router from which that network is hidden.

   NOTE:  An exterior router hides a network by excluding the routing
   information for that network from RI-Rsp, RI-Upd, GZN-Rsp, and GDZL-
   Rsp packets. However, network management packets-such as RTMP Route



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 44]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   Data Response (RDR) packets that are not split horizoned, and Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) packets-should include the routing
   information for hidden networks. For detailed information about the
   effects of AURP on network management, see the section "Network
   Management" in Chapter 4.

   AURP Packet Format

   An exterior router encapsulates both AURP packets and AppleTalk data
   packets using the same headers. Before forwarding AURP packets across
   a tunnel, an exterior router encapsulates the AURP packets in packets
   of the tunnel's underlying foreign network system-by adding the
   headers required by that network system. For more information about
   these headers, see the sections "Forwarding Data," "AppleTalk Data-
   Packet Format," and "AppleTalk Data-Packet Format for IP Tunneling"
   in Chapter 2.

   When using AURP-Tr in conjunction with TCP/IP, an exterior router
   encapsulates AURP packets in UDP packets prior to forwarding them
   across an IP tunnel through UDP port 387. When another exterior
   router on the tunnel receives the UDP packets at UDP port 387, it
   decapsulates the packets.

   Domain Headers in AURP Packets

   When forwarding AURP packets across a tunnel, an exterior router adds
   a domain header immediately preceding each packet. A domain header
   contains additional addressing information, including its source
   domain identifier and destination domain identifier (DI). The last
   two bytes of the domain header are set to 0003, indicating that the
   packet is an AURP packet rather than an AppleTalk packet. AURP data
   follows the domain header. Figure 3-20 shows the protocol headers,
   the domain header, and the routing data header that encapsulate a
   routing data packet sent across an IP tunnel.

          &lt;&lt;Figure 3-20  A routing data packet on an IP tunnel&gt;&gt;

   An exterior router interprets the domain identifiers in the domain
   header of an AURP packet differently from those in the domain headers
   of an AppleTalk data packet. Only network entities with AppleTalk
   addresses have domain identifiers associated with them. Exterior
   routers do not have AppleTalk addresses on the tunnel-thus, they do
   not have true domain identifiers.

   DESTINATION DOMAIN IDENTIFIER: The destination DI in an AURP packet's
   domain header is the DI that is associated with any network numbers
   corresponding to networks that reside in the receiving exterior
   router's domain. Only ZI-Req packets include such network numbers.



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 45]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-46" id="page-46" name="page-46"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   Whenever possible, a domain header should specify a destination DI-
   that is, the DI for the networks that reside in the domain of the
   exterior router that is to receive the packet. When an exterior
   router sends an Open-Req to open a connection, the destination DI is
   not yet known.  However, under the current version of AURP, the
   exterior router can either derive the destination DI from the
   destination's IP address or, on point-to-point links, include the
   null DI.

   SOURCE DOMAIN IDENTIFIER: The source DI in an AURP packet's domain
   header is the DI that is associated with any network numbers
   corresponding to networks that reside in the sending exterior
   router's domain. RI-Rsp, RI-Upd, ZI-Rsp, and GZN-Rsp packets include
   such network numbers. A domain header should always specify a source
   DI-that is, the DI for the networks that reside in the domain of the
   exterior router that is sending the packet.

   Routing Data Headers in AURP Packets

   The routing data header that immediately precedes the AURP data in a
   routing data packet consists of an AURP-Tr header and an AURP header.
   The AURP-Tr header consists of the following fields:

   Connection ID:  The contents of this two-byte field identify the
   specific one-way connection to which a packet belongs.

   Sequence number:  The contents of this two-byte field identify an
   individual packet on a connection.

   The AURP header consists of these fields:

   Command code:  This two-byte field identifies the command type. For
   information about command types, see the next section, "Command
   Types."

   Flags:  This two-byte field may contain different flags, depending on
   the command code. For information about flags, see the section
   "Routing Flags" later in this chapter.

   Command Types

   AURP defines the command types shown in Table 3-1:

   Routing Flags

   AURP defines the flags shown in Table 3-2. All other flags are
   reserved.  A data sender should set reserved flags to 0. A data
   receiver should ignore reserved flags.

   Open Request Packet

   An Open-Req packet initiates the establishment of a one-way
   connection with a data sender. Figure 3-23 shows the format of an
   Open-Req packet.  When sending an Open-Req packet, an exterior router
   inserts the next available connection ID in the packet's AURP-Tr
   header and sets its sequence number to 0. The AURP header of an
   Open-Req contains the command code 8. Its flag bytes contain send
   update information (SUI) flags. For the current version of AURP, the
   version number is 1.

   An Open-Req packet's option data field contains

      an option count-indicating the number of option tuples to follow

      the option tuples

   When the data sender receives an Open-Req, it can discard the option
   tuples for any options it does not implement. For information about
   option tuples, see the section "Option Tuples" later in this chapter.

                  &lt;&lt;Figure 3-23  Open-Req packet format&gt;&gt;

   Open Response Packet

   When the data sender receives an Open-Req, it responds by sending an
   Open-Rsp packet to establish a one-way connection with the data
   receiver. Figure 3-24 shows the format of an Open-Rsp packet. In its
   AURP-Tr header, an Open-Rsp packet contains the connection ID from
   the associated Open-Req packet and the sequence number 0. The AURP
   header of an Open-Rsp contains the command code 9 and its flag bytes
   contain environment flags that provide information about the data
   sender's environment-such as whether network-number remapping or
   hop-count reduction is active. For information about network-number
   remapping and hop-count reduction, see the sections "Network-Number
   Remapping" and "Hop-Count Reduction," respectively, in Chapter 4.

                  &lt;&lt;Figure 3-24  Open-Rsp packet format&gt;&gt;

   An Open-Rsp packet's option data field contains

      a two-byte field that indicates either
         the nominal rate at which the data sender sends updates-in
         multiples of ten seconds
         an error code-which is a negative number-if the data sender
         cannot accept the connection

      the option tuples

   For information about error codes, see the section "Error Codes"
   later in this chapter. For information about option tuples, see the
   next section, "Option Tuples."

   Option Tuples

   Both Open-Req and Open-Rsp packets contain option tuples. An option
   tuple contains a one-byte length field that indicates the length of
   the remainder of the tuple, a one-byte type code, and an optional
   data field, as shown in Figure 3-25.

                      &lt;&lt;Figure 3-25  Option tuples&gt;&gt;

   AURP currently defines the option-type codes shown in Table 3-3:

   Routing Information Request Packet

   An RI-Req packet requests the data sender to send RI-Rsp packets.
   Figure 3-26 shows the format for an RI-Req packet. When sending an
   RI-Req packet, an exterior router inserts the connection ID for the
   connection on which it is the data receiver in the packet's AURP-Tr
   header and sets the packet's sequence number to 0. The AURP header of
   an RI-Req contains the command code 1 and its flag bytes contain the
   send update information (SUI) flags.

                   &lt;&lt;Figure 3-26  RI-Req packet format&gt;&gt;

   Routing Information Response Packet

   When the data sender receives an RI-Req, it responds by sending a
   sequence of RI-Rsp packets. Figure 3-27 shows the format of an RI-Rsp
   packet. When sending an RI-Rsp packet, a data sender inserts the
   connection ID from the associated RI-Req in the RI-Rsp packet's
   AURP-Tr header and sets its sequence number to the next number in the
   sequence.  The AURP header of an RI-Rsp packet contains the command
   code 2. In the last packet in a sequence of RI-Rsp packets, the

   last-flag bit is set to 1.

                   &lt;&lt;Figure 3-27  RI-Rsp packet format&gt;&gt;

   An RI-Rsp packet's routing data field contains zero or more routing
   tuples, which have a format similar to those in RTMP packets. An AURP
   tuple for a nonextended network is different from an RTMP tuple for
   an extended network in one respect-the range flag, or the sixth byte,
   in an AURP tuple for a nonextended network is set to 0. Figure 3-28
   shows nonextended and extended network tuples in an RI-Rsp packet.

         &lt;&lt;Figure 3-28  Nonextended and extended network tuples&gt;&gt;

   Routing Information Acknowledgment Packet

   When a data receiver receives an RI-Rsp, RI-Upd, or RD packet, it
   responds by sending an RI-Ack packet. Figure 3-29 shows the format of
   an RI-Ack packet. When sending an RI-Ack packet, a data receiver
   inserts the connection ID and sequence number from the associated
   RI-Rsp, RI-Upd, or RD packet in the RI-Ack packet's AURP-Tr header.
   The AURP header of an RI-Ack contains the command code 3. If the data
   receiver sends an RI-Ack using AURP-Tr, in response to an RI-Rsp or
   RI-Upd packet that contains an NA event, its flag bytes contain the
   send zone information flag. An RI-Ack packet contains no data.

                   &lt;&lt;Figure 3-29  RI-Ack packet format&gt;&gt;

   Routing Information Update Packet

   The occurrence of specified events requires the data sender to send
   an RI-Upd packet. Figure 3-30 shows the format of an RI-Upd packet.
   When sending an RI-Upd packet, a data sender inserts the connection
   ID for the current connection in the RI-Upd packet's AURP-Tr header
   and sets its sequence number to the next number in the sequence. The
   AURP header of an RI-Upd contains the command code 4 and its flag
   bytes are set to 0.

                   &lt;&lt;Figure 3-30  RI-Upd packet format&gt;&gt;

   An RI-Upd packet's data field contains one or more event tuples. An
   event tuple for a nonextended network consists of a one-byte event
   code, the network number, and the distance to that network. An event
   tuple for an extended network consists of a one-byte event code, the
   first network number in the range of network numbers, the distance to
   the network, and the last network number in the range of network
   numbers. Figure 3-31 shows nonextended and extended network tuples in
   an RI-Upd packet.




<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 50]</span></pre>

      &lt;&lt;Figure 3-31  Nonextended and extended network event tuples&gt;&gt;

   AURP currently defines the event codes shown in Table 3-4:

                          Table 3-4  Event codes

   Event                             Abbreviation     Event code

   Null event                                         0
   Network Added event               NA               1
   Network Deleted event             ND               2
   Network Route Change event        NRC              3
   Network Distance Change event     NDC              4
   Zone Change event                 ZC               5

   A null event tuple contains no event data. The format of NA, ND, NRC,
   and NDC event tuples differs, depending on whether the event pertains
   to a nonextended or an extended network. The distance field does not
   apply to ND or NRC event tuples and should be set to 0. The ZC event
   tuple is not yet defined.

   An RI-Upd packet should never contain two events that pertain to the
   same network. However, to ensure consistent behavior in the event
   that an exterior router receives a packet containing multiple events
   for one network, an exterior router should always process events in
   the order in which they occur in the RI-Upd packet. Thus, if an
   exterior router were to receive an RI-Upd that contained an NA event,
   then an ND event for the same network, the exterior router would
   delete the network from its routing table.

   Router Down Packet

   An exterior router should send an RD packet before it goes down.
   Figure 3-32 shows the format of an RD packet. When sending an RD
   packet, an exterior router inserts the connection ID for the current
   connection in the RD packet's AURP-Tr header. If the data sender
   sends an RD packet, it sets its sequence number to the next number in
   the sequence. If the data receiver sends an RD packet, it sets its
   sequence number to 0. The AURP header of an RD packet contains the
   command code 5 and its flag bytes are set to 0.

   Zone Information Request/Response Transactions

   An exterior router returns information about its zones through
   request/response transactions. Three types of zone requests-ZI-Req,
   GDZL-Req, and GZN-Req-share the same command code and have subcodes
   that indicate the actual request type. Three types of zone
   responses-ZI-Rsp, GDZL-Rsp, and GZN-Rsp-share another command code
   and have subcodes that indicate the actual response type.

   ZONE INFORMATION REQUEST PACKET: A ZI-Req packet causes the data
   sender to send ZI-Rsp packets. Figure 3-33 shows the format of a ZI-
   Req packet.  When sending a ZI-Req packet, an exterior router inserts
   the connection ID for the connection on which it is the data receiver
   in the packet's AURP-Tr header and sets the packet's sequence number
   to 0. The AURP header of a ZI-Req contains the command code 6 and its
   flag bytes are set to 0.

                   &lt;&lt;Figure 3-33  ZI-Req packet format&gt;&gt;

   A ZI-Req packet's data field contains the subcode 1 and a two-byte
   network number for each network about which the exterior router is
   requesting zone information. The network number for an extended
   network is the first network number in its range of network numbers.

   ZONE INFORMATION RESPONSE PACKET: There are two types of ZI-Rsp
   packets-nonextended ZI-Rsp packets and extended ZI-Rsp packets. The
   format of a nonextended ZI-Rsp packet is similar to that of a
   nonextended AppleTalk ZIP Reply packet. When the data sender receives
   a ZI-Req and the zone list for the network or networks for which that
   ZI-Req requested zone information fits in one ZI-Rsp packet, it sends
   a nonextended ZI-Rsp.

   An extended ZI-Rsp packet is similar to an extended AppleTalk ZIP
   Reply packet. When the data sender receives a ZI-Req and the zone
   list for a network about which that ZI-Req requested zone information
   does not fit in a single ZI-Rsp packet, it sends a sequence of
   extended ZI-Rsp packets.

   Figure 3-34 shows the format of a ZI-Rsp packet. When sending a ZI-
   Rsp packet, a data sender inserts the connection ID from the
   associated ZI-Req packet in the packet's AURP-Tr header and sets the
   packet's sequence number to 0. A ZI-Rsp packet's AURP header contains
   the command code 7 and its flag bytes are set to 0. The subcode 1
   indicates a nonextended ZI-Rsp packet, while the subcode 2 indicates
   an extended ZI-Rsp packet.

                   &lt;&lt;Figure 3-34  ZI-Rsp packet format&gt;&gt;

   A ZI-Rsp packet's data field contains the requested zone information.
   Its format is similar to that of a ZIP Reply packet.

   In a nonextended ZI-Rsp packet, the first two bytes of the data field
   should indicate the number of tuples contained in the packet, while
   the remaining bytes constitute network number/zone name tuples.
   Within the packet, all of the tuples for a given network must be
   contiguous.  NOTE:  When sending a nonextended ZI-Rsp packet, an
   exterior router should attempt to specify the correct number of zone
   tuples. However, an exterior router receiving a nonextended ZI-Rsp
   packet should process all tuples contained in the packet, regardless
   of the number indicated in the header.

   Network number/zone name tuples in a nonextended ZI-Rsp packet can
   use either the long tuple format or the optimized tuple format. A
   long network number/zone name tuple contains a network number,
   followed by the length of the zone name, and the zone name.

   Using the optimized tuple format, an exterior router can compress a
   nonextended ZI-Rsp packet in which more than one network contains the
   same zone name in its zone list. If the high-order bit of the length
   byte for a given zone name is set to 1, the following 15 bits
   represent an offset from the length byte of the first zone name in
   the packet's data field to the actual location of the zone name
   length and the zone name. Whenever possible, it is recommended that
   an exterior router send optimized ZI-Rsp packets. All exterior
   routers must be able to receive optimized ZI-Rsp packets.

   In an extended ZI-Rsp packet, the first two bytes of the data field
   indicate the total number of tuples in the zone list for the network
   or networks for which the corresponding ZI-Req requested zone
   information.  The remaining bytes in the data field of an extended
   ZI-Rsp packet consist of network number/zone name tuples. All tuples
   in a single extended ZI-Rsp packet must contain the same network
   number. However, for consistency with the format of network
   number/zone name tuples in nonextended ZI-Rsp packets, the network
   number precedes each zone name in an extended ZI-Rsp packet.
   Duplicate zone names never exist in extended ZI-Rsp packets-
   therefore, extended ZI-Rsp packets use the long tuple format, rather
   than the optimized tuple format.

   Figure 3-35 shows the long tuple and optimized tuple formats for a
   ZI-Rsp packet.

   GET DOMAIN ZONE LIST REQUEST PACKET: A Get Domain Zone List Request
   packet, or GDZL-Req, requests the data sender to send GDZL-Rsp

   packets.  Figure 3-36 shows the format for a GDZL-Req packet. When
   sending a GDZL-Req packet, an exterior router inserts the connection
   ID for the connection on which it is the data receiver in the
   packet's AURP-Tr header and sets its sequence number to 0. The AURP
   header of a GDZL-Req contains the command code 6 and its flag bytes
   are set to 0.

                  &lt;&lt;Figure 3-36  GDZL-Req packet format&gt;&gt;

   A GDZL-Req packet's data field contains the subcode 4 and the start
   index in the data sender's zone list at which to begin returning
   GDZL-Rsp packets.

   GET DOMAIN ZONE LIST RESPONSE PACKET: When the data sender receives a
   GDZL-Req, it responds by sending a GDZL-Rsp packet. Figure 3-37 shows
   the format of a GDZL-Rsp packet. When sending a GDZL-Rsp packet, a
   data sender inserts the connection ID from the associated GDZL-Req
   packet in the packet's AURP-Tr header and sets its sequence number to
   0. The AURP header of a GDZL-Rsp contains the command code 7 and its
   flag bytes are set to 0, except in the last packet containing zone
   information, which has its last flag set to 1.

                  &lt;&lt;Figure 3-37  GDZL-Rsp packet format&gt;&gt;

   A GDZL-Rsp packet's data field contains the subcode 4, the start
   index from the associated GDZL-Req, and the zone list. If the data
   sender does not support the GDZL-Req, it should set the start index
   to -1.

   GET ZONES NET REQUEST PACKET: A Get Zones Net Request packet, or
   GZN-Req, requests the data sender to send zone information for one
   specific zone. Figure 3-38 shows the format of a GZN-Req packet. When
   sending a GZN-Req packet, an exterior router inserts the connection
   ID for the connection on which it is the data receiver in the
   packet's AURP-Tr header and sets its sequence number to 0. The AURP
   header of a GZN-Req contains the command code 6 and its flag bytes
   are set to 0.

   its flag bytes are set to 0.

                  &lt;&lt;Figure 3-39  GZN-Rsp packet format&gt;&gt;

   A GZN-Rsp packet's data field contains the subcode 3, the zone name
   from the associated GZN-Req, the total number of network tuples for
   that zone, and as many network tuples as can fit in the packet. These
   tuples have the same format as those in RI-Rsp packets. If the data
   sender has no information about the zone, it returns a GZN-Rsp in
   which the number of network tuples is 0. If the data sender does not
   support the GZN-Req, it should set the number of network tuples to
   -1.

   TICKLE PACKET: The data receiver sends a Tickle packet to verify that
   the data received from the data sender is still valid. Figure 3-40
   shows the format of a Tickle packet. When sending a Tickle packet, an
   exterior router inserts the connection ID for the connection on which
   it is the data receiver in the packet's AURP-Tr header and sets its
   sequence number to 0. The AURP header of a Tickle contains the
   command code 14 and its flag bytes are set to 0. A Tickle packet
   contains no data.

                   &lt;&lt;Figure 3-40  Tickle packet format&gt;&gt;

   TICKLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT PACKET: When the data sender receives a Tickle,
   it responds by sending a Tickle-Ack packet. Figure 3-41 shows the
   format of a Tickle-Ack. When sending a Tickle-Ack, a data sender
   inserts the connection ID from the associated Tickle in the Tickle-
   Ack packet's AURP-Tr header and sets its sequence number to 0. The
   AURP header of a Tickle-Ack packet contains the command code 15 and
   its flag bytes are set to 0. A Tickle-Ack packet contains no data.

   This chapter describes optional features of AURP-some of which can
   also be implemented on routers that use RTMP rather than AURP for
   routing-information propagation. It provides detailed information
   about the presentation of wide area network information by exterior
   routers to nodes on their local internets or to other exterior
   routers, including:

      basic security-both network hiding and device hiding

      remapping of remote network numbers

      internet clustering

      loop detection

   Network Hiding

   An exterior router can hide networks by importing or exporting
   routing information only about specific networks.

   Importing Routing Information About Specific Networks

   A network administrator can configure a tunneling port on an exterior
   router to import only a subset of the routing information that it
   receives through the tunnel. To do so, the administrator hides
   specific networks connected to other exterior routers on the tunnel
   from the exterior router's local internet. For example, an exterior
   router can import only that routing information received from
   specific exterior routers, or routing information for networks in a
   specific network range or zone. By importing routing information only
   about specific networks, an exterior router can greatly reduce

      the amount of routing information maintained by routers on its
      local internet

      the number of zones and devices that are visible to devices on its
      local internet

   Exporting Routing Information About Specific Networks

   A network administrator can configure a tunneling port on an exterior
   router to export only a subset of its local internet's routing
   information-by hiding from other exterior routers on the tunnel
   specific networks in its local internet. For more information about
   hiding networks from other exterior routers, see the section "Hiding
   Local Networks From Tunnels" in Chapter 2.

   Device Hiding

   A router can prevent a device in its local internet from being
   visible to other nodes on a specific part or all other parts of the
   internet by not forwarding Name Binding Protocol (NBP) LkUp-Reply
   packets from that device. Hiding a device prevents nodes on the part
   of the internet from which it is hidden from knowing the name of the
   hidden device, making it more difficult for those nodes to access the
   hidden device. Any AppleTalk Phase 2 router can hide devices.

   Advantages and Disadvantages

   Device hiding is a flexible security mechanism that is appropriate
   for organizations that do not require true device-specific security.
   It is not a substitute for device-specific security. Device hiding
   can provide a degree of security on devices for which no other form
   of security exists-such as LaserWriter printers.

   A user can write a program that can obtain access to a hidden device
   using its AppleTalk address. Device hiding cannot secure a device
   from a user that is not using NBP to access the device.

   Device hiding does not provide true device-specific security. Many
   devices require device-specific security-for example, AppleShare file
   servers. Device-specific security can provide various levels of
   security, and may allow a network administrator to grant access
   privileges based on registered users and groups.

   Configuring Device Hiding on a Port

   When configuring a port on a router that implements device hiding, a
   network administrator should be able to hide any device that is
   accessible through that port from the other ports on the router. The



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 57]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   device being hidden need not reside on the network connected directly
   to the port being configured.

   An administrator should be able to specify the ports from which to
   hide a device-either specific ports or all other ports.

   When hiding devices, an administrator should be able to specify that
   a list of devices either be hidden or visible. The device list should
   include device names and device types-for example, We-B-
   Nets:AFPServer.  An administrator should also be able to hide all
   devices of a given type-for example, all LaserWriter printers-or all
   devices of all types.

   Filtering NBP LkUp-Reply Packets

   To implement device hiding, a router selectively filters NBP LkUp-
   Reply packets. When a port's configuration specifies that devices
   accessible through the port be hidden, the router

      monitors all NBP LkUp-Reply packets received through that port-
      called the incoming port

      determines the port through which it is to forward such a packet-
      called the outgoing port

      obtains-from the port configuration for the incoming port-the list
      of devices to be hidden from the outgoing port

      determines whether it should filter all or part of an NBP LkUp-
      Reply packet

         If a port's configuration does not specify that devices be
         hidden from the outgoing port, the router forwards the packet.

         If a port's configuration specifies that devices be hidden from
         the outgoing port, the router checks each tuple in the NBP LkUp-
         Reply packet to determine whether it is from a device in the
         port's list of hidden devices. It marks tuples from hidden
         devices for deletion. Once the router scans the entire packet,
         it forwards the packet if no tuples were marked for deletion; it
         discards the packet if all tuples were marked for deletion; or,
         if only some tuples were marked for deletion, it rebuilds the
         packet without the tuples marked for deletion, then forwards the
         packet.

   When the router rebuilds a packet, it adjusts the tuple count in the
   packet's NBP header to reflect the number of tuples remaining. If a
   rebuilt packet's DDP header contains a nonzero checksum, the router



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 58]</span></pre>

   verifies the original checksum, then sets it to 0.

   This device-hiding scheme can handle both NBP Lookups and NBP
   Confirms, because a node responds to requests of either type with a
   LkUp-Reply packet.

   LkUp-Reply packets do not contain the names of zones in which devices
   reside. Thus, if two devices having the same name and type are
   accessible through a port, a network administrator can hide both
   devices or neither device, but not just one of the devices.

   When configuring ports on routers through which redundant paths to a
   device exist, a network administrator must hide that device on at
   least one port on each path to that device. Otherwise, only a router
   on which such a port was configured to hide the device would filter
   LkUp-Reply packets from the device. A router on which such a port was
   not configured to hide the device would not filter its LkUp-Reply
   packets.  Figure 4-1 shows the proper configuration of device hiding
   when a loop exists on the internet.

     &lt;&lt;Figure 4-1  Device hiding when a loop exists on the internet&gt;&gt;

   Resolving Network-Numbering Conflicts

   In addition to interconnecting different parts of one organization's
   internet, tunnels can interconnect the internets of multiple
   organizations. Each organization administrates its internet
   independently. Therefore, conflicting network numbers may exist on
   the internets, especially when many internets are interconnected. The
   following sections describe the methods that AURP uses to resolve
   various problems due to conflicting network numbers.

   Network-Number Remapping

   Network-number remapping resolves network-numbering conflicts,
   allowing network administrators to build very large internets. When
   configuring a port on an exterior router, an administrator can
   specify a range of AppleTalk network numbers to be used for imported
   networks-that is, networks that are accessible through half-routing
   or tunneling ports, for which the exterior router imports routing
   information from other exterior routers. The remapping range-the
   range of network numbers reserved for network-number remapping-must
   not conflict with any network numbers already in use on the exterior
   router's local internet.

   The exterior router maps the network numbers in incoming packets into
   the remapping range. It converts remapped network numbers back to
   their actual network numbers for outgoing packets. To nodes and



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 59]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   routers within the exterior router's local internet, packets
   containing remapped network numbers apparently originate from or are
   being sent to networks having numbers in the remapping range.

   UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS: In a tunneling environment, many different
   internets may include AppleTalk networks that have the same network
   numbers.  Therefore, each exterior router on an internet must
   associate a unique identifier (UI) with each network that it exports
   across the tunnel-that is, each network in its local internet that is
   not hidden. Generally, some type of global administration of UIs is
   necessary.

   On a given tunnel, each exterior router on which network-number
   remapping is active must have a unique domain identifier (DI). An
   exterior router using AURP derives a network's UI by concatenating
   the exterior router's DI-which is unique on the tunnel-with the
   packet's network number or range-which is unique within the exterior
   router's domain. For more information about domain identifiers, see
   the section "Domain Identifiers" in Chapter 2.

   On a tunneling port, an exterior router refers to AppleTalk network
   numbers and network ranges using UIs. Whenever an exterior router
   sends or receives AppleTalk data packets across the tunnel, it refers
   to any network numbers or ranges in the packets-for example, in a
   packet's DDP header-by their UIs. For example, when an exterior
   router sends an RI- Rsp, which provides a list of network ranges for
   its local internet to other exterior routers on the tunnel, it lists
   the UIs corresponding to those network ranges. When an exterior
   router receives RI-Rsp packets from other exterior routers on the
   tunnel, it interprets the data in each packet as a list of UIs.

   Network-number remapping should be an optional component of any
   tunneling scheme. An administrator should be able to configure a
   tunneling port with or without specifying network-number remapping.
   When network-number remapping is inactive on all of the exterior
   routers on a tunnel, each AppleTalk network number and range
   associated with the exterior routers must be unique.

   MAPPINGS: An exterior router uses the following process to map
   AppleTalk network numbers and ranges to UIs, and vice versa:

      The exterior router logically maps network numbers in the exterior
      router's local internet to the corresponding UIs before sending a
      packet out the tunneling port, as shown in Figure 4-2. The UI
      consists of the source DI in the domain header and the network
      number from the packet. Therefore, the exterior router changes no
      data in the packet to perform this mapping.

      The exterior router logically maps UIs corresponding to local
      networks in packets received through the tunneling port back to
      their local network numbers before forwarding the packets to the
      exterior router's local internet, as shown in Figure 4-2. The
      exterior router changes no data in the packet. This mapping is the
      inverse of the previous mapping.

      The exterior router maps UIs corresponding to network numbers for
      remote networks-that is, networks connected to other exterior
      routers on the tunnel-that are in packets received through the
      tunneling port to network numbers in the remapping range configured
      for the local internet, as shown in Figure 4-2. An exterior router
      remaps network numbers from the following fields in this way:

         the source network number field in the DDP header of an
         AppleTalk data packet

         the NBP entity address field in an AppleTalk data packet

         the routing data field in an AURP routing-information packet

      The exterior router maps network numbers in the remapping range
      configured for the local internet back to the corresponding UIs
      before sending packets out the tunneling port, as shown in Figure
      4-2. This type of remapping applies only to network numbers that
      reside in a destination network-number field of a DDP header in an
      AppleTalk data packet. This mapping is the inverse of the previous
      mapping.

     &lt;&lt;Figure 4-2 Mappings between local and remote internets' network
                             numbers and UIs&gt;&gt;

   NOTE:  Network-number remapping changes an AppleTalk data packet's
   DDP header and may also change its data. Thus, if a packet contains a
   DDP checksum, when the exterior router remaps network numbers
   contained in the packet, it must verify that the checksum is correct,
   then set the checksum to 0. If the checksum is incorrect, the
   exterior router should discard the packet.

   An exterior router can perform network-number remapping either
   statically or dynamically. Static remapping reserves specific network
   numbers in the remapping range for mapping specific UIs. Dynamic
   remapping assigns network numbers in the remapping range to networks
   as they become known to an exterior router.

   Static remapping is simpler to implement and provides a known mapping
   for use in network management. However, it may limit the number of
   UIs that an exterior router can import into its local internet.

   Dynamic mapping requires a scheme for network number reuse, but may
   provide connectivity to a greater number of networks across a tunnel.

   To avoid having the same UI refer to two different networks when
   remapping network numbers dynamically, an exterior router should
   reuse network numbers in its remapping range only when no other
   network numbers are available. If a network goes down, an exterior
   router should not immediately reassign the UI that referred to that
   network to another network that just came up on the internet.

   An exterior router connected to more than one tunnel should function
   as though it were two exterior routers-each connected to one tunnel
   and both connected to one AppleTalk internet. Thus, such an exterior
   router must use remapped network numbers when sending routing
   information across a tunnel about networks that are accessible
   through another tunnel.

   Network Numbers in Data

   To remap network numbers properly, an exterior router must be aware
   of their presence within AppleTalk data packets. It is difficult to
   detect network numbers in data packets, because they could be
   anywhere within a data packet. For example, NBP includes network
   addresses as part of its data-in entity addresses. However, the data
   packets for very few protocols contain any network numbers. Some
   third-party protocols may contain network addresses in their data.
   Protocols that contain network addresses in their data may not
   function properly across remapping exterior routers.

   Packets used for network management-such as RTMP Route Data Response
   (RDR) and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) packets-contain
   network numbers in their data. For detailed information about
   handling network numbers in SNMP packets, see the section "Network
   Management" later in this chapter.

   Problems With Loops

   Network-number remapping introduces some problems on an internet when
   loops exist across a tunnel. If network-number remapping is active,
   two AppleTalk internets connected by a tunnel should not be
   interconnected in any other way. If a redundant path to an internet
   exists, a remapped network range can loop back through that path to
   the exterior router that originally remapped the network range. When
   this occurs, two different network ranges-the network range actually
   configured and the remapping of the configured range-refer to one
   network.





<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 62]</span></pre>

   The remapped network range apparently refers to a new network in the
   exterior router's local internet. Such a network is referred to as a
   shadow network. The exterior router cannot determine that it has
   received a network range that it had previously remapped, because
   there is no apparent difference between a remapped network range and
   an actual network range. Thus, unless an administrator configures an
   exterior router with an explicit list of networks to export, the
   exterior router again remaps the network range, then exports the
   remapped network range, sending it around the loop. The network range
   is remapped repeatedly until the apparent distance to the network
   exceeds the hop-count limit.  Exterior routers that implement
   network-number remapping should avoid establishing such infinite
   loops. For information about preventing such loops, see the section
   "Routing Loops" later in this chapter.

   Redundant Paths

   Under certain circumstances, it might be desirable to create a
   redundant path, which is a special type of loop. Redundant paths
   connect an internet to a tunnel through two or more exterior routers.
   If network-number remapping is active, all redundant exterior routers
   must use the same DI to represent the local internet-and must map UIs
   representing remote networks in incoming packets to the same local
   network numbers.

   To allow redundant exterior routers to achieve such cooperation, a
   network administrator might configure all redundant exterior routers
   with the same DI and complete remapping information for all imported
   networks. Alternatively, a network administrator might configure one
   exterior router with this information and all redundant exterior
   routers could obtain the information from the configured exterior
   router. AURP does not currently support this functionality, but may
   do so in the future.

   Tunnels With Partial Network-Number Remapping

   When network-number remapping is active on a tunneling port, an
   exterior router maps network numbers in packets received through the
   tunnel into the remapping range for its local internet. Because a
   network administrator configures network-number remapping on
   individual exterior routers, network-number remapping may be
   configured on some exterior routers on a tunnel, but not on others-
   potentially causing network-numbering conflicts due to partial
   network-number remapping. Whenever possible, an administrator should
   configure network-number remapping either on all exterior routers on
   a tunnel or on none of them.  Otherwise, network-numbering conflicts
   are likely to occur on some of the exterior routers-especially on
   large, interorganizational internets.



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 63]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   In addition to potential network-numbering conflicts, partial
   network-number remapping and the lack of loop detection between
   nonremapping exterior routers may cause shadow copies of networks
   connected to more than one nonremapping exterior router to appear in
   the routing tables on remapping exterior routers.

   An exterior router on which network-number remapping is active
   performs loop detection. Therefore, when network-number remapping is
   active on all of the exterior routers on a tunnel, no loops can exist
   across the tunnel. However, exterior routers on which network-number
   remapping is not active do not perform loop detection. Thus, when
   network-number remapping is not active on some of the exterior
   routers on a tunnel, any loops that exist between nonremapping
   exterior routers are not detected.

   In the example shown in Figure 4-3, shadow copies of all networks
   that are in the local internets of both exterior router B and
   exterior router C, on which network-number remapping is not active,
   appear in the routing table of exterior router A, on which network-
   number remapping is active.

      &lt;&lt;Figure 4-3  A tunnel with partial network-number remapping&gt;&gt;

   Clustering Remapped Networks

   Because a remapping range is a range of sequential network numbers,
   an exterior router can represent multiple remapped networks as a
   single extended network within its local internet-that is, it can
   cluster remapped networks. Clustering greatly reduces the size of the
   routing tables that are maintained and sent by routers within an
   internet, as well as the amount of RTMP traffic on the internet.
   Clustering may also reduce the amount of NBP traffic on an internet.

   For example, as shown in Figure 4-4, if networks in an internet have
   the numbers 1, 100, and 1000, and an exterior router connected to a
   different part of the internet receives these network numbers across
   the tunnel, that exterior router might remap the network numbers to
   21, 22, and 23. When sending RTMP packets within its local internet,
   the remapping exterior router can represent the three networks as a
   single extended network with a network range from 21 to 23. The zones
   associated with the extended network include all of the zones
   associated with the three imported network numbers.

            &lt;&lt;Figure 4-4  Clustering remapped network numbers&gt;&gt;

   An exterior router determines which remapped network numbers it
   should cluster. For example, an exterior router might create one
   cluster for each other exterior router on the tunnel. However, an



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 64]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-65" id="page-65" name="page-65"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   exterior router can include no more than 255 zones in one cluster.

   An exterior router that implements clustering must maintain the
   actual network range and zone list for each network in a cluster. The
   exterior router monitors all NBP FwdReq packets to be forwarded
   across the tunnel-including those it generates in response to BrRq
   packets. It examines the DDP destination network number in each
   FwdReq packet to determine the cluster to which it is addressed. The
   exterior router then generates one FwdReq packet for each clustered
   network for which the FwdReq packet contains a zone name, and sends
   that packet to the next internet router for the network. The DDP
   destination network number in such a FwdReq packet corresponds to the
   starting network number of a network's actual network range.

   A disadvantage of clustering is that clusters are static. An exterior
   router cannot notify its local internet that a specific network or
   zone in a cluster has gone down. An exterior router's implementation
   of clustering could allow a network administrator to initiate
   reclustering-in which the exterior router notifies the internet that
   an entire cluster has gone down, then creates a new cluster that does
   not include the networks that have gone down. However, such
   reclustering would cause a temporary loss of connectivity to those
   networks in the cluster that are still accessible. Therefore, an
   exterior router should not automatically recluster network numbers.

   REUSING NETWORK NUMBERS WITHIN A CLUSTER: Under certain conditions,
   an exterior router that implements clustering might reuse network
   numbers within a cluster. If a network went down, then came back up
   with the same zone list, an exterior router could map its network
   range into the same remapping range and include it in the same
   cluster. Otherwise, an exterior router should not reuse network
   numbers within a cluster, unless no other network numbers within the
   remapping range are available. In any case, an exterior router can
   reuse network numbers within a cluster only if a new network has a
   network range that fits in an unused range of network numbers within
   the cluster and a zone list that is a subset of the cluster's zone
   list.

   The implementation of clustering in an exterior router is complex.
   See the Appendix, "Implementation Details," for some ways in which
   clustering could be implemented.

   Zone-Name Management

   To enhance zone-name management within an AppleTalk internet, AURP
   provides Get Domain Zone List and Get Zone Nets requests-which
   function similarly to the ZIP GetZoneList command and ZI-Req command,
   respectively. However, as when using RTMP and ZIP, if two networks in



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 65]</span></pre>

   an internet include zones that have the same zone name in their zone
   lists, exterior routers merge the zones into one zone-regardless of
   whether network-number remapping is active on one or more of the
   exterior routers.

   Because AppleTalk data packets often contain zone names, AURP
   provides no means of remapping zone names. When importing or
   exporting zone names, an exterior router should not modify them in
   any way.

   On a very large internet, zone names may become unmanageable.
   Therefore, an administrator should use domain-specific prefixes-such
   as Engineering or Sales-for zone names on such an internet. The use
   of a third-party hierarchical Chooser also might simplify zone-name
   management.

   Hop-Count Reduction

   Generally, an exterior router increases the hop count in the DDP
   header of an AppleTalk data packet by at least one when it forwards
   the packet across a tunnel. Once a packet traverses 15 routers-either
   local routers or exterior routers-its hop count exceeds the maximum.
   Thus, when an exterior router receives a packet through its tunneling
   port, it should examine that packet's DDP hop count before forwarding
   the packet. If the exterior router receives a packet with a hop count
   of 15 hops, it does not forward the packet to another router, but
   discards the packet.

   When a tunnel or point-to-point link connects AppleTalk internets,
   the distance that a packet must traverse can easily exceed 15 hops. A
   network administrator might need full connectivity between two
   internets at a distance exceeding 15 hops. If the distance across an
   exterior router's local internet is already at or near the 15-hop
   limit, the exterior router must reduce the perceived distance that a
   packet must traverse to allow the packet to reach a destination at a
   distance that exceeds 15 hops. To overcome DDP's 15-hop limit, an
   exterior router reduces the hop count in the DDP header of an Apple
   data packet received through a tunnel before forwarding the packet
   into its local AppleTalk internet. An exterior router should reduce
   the hop count only by the number of hops necessary to allow the
   packet to reach its destination without exceeding the hop-count
   limit.

   When an exterior router receives a packet through the tunnel, it
   examines the routing-table entry for that packet's destination
   network to determine the remaining distance to that network. If the
   distance already traversed by the packet-the packet's current hop
   count-plus the distance to the destination network is less than 15



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 66]</span></pre>

   hops, the exterior router simply forwards the packet. If adding the
   destination network's distance to the packet's current hop count
   causes the hop count to exceed 15 hops, the exterior router sets the
   hop count to the following value: 15 minus the distance in hops to
   the destination network. The exterior router then forwards the
   packet.

   Using hop-count reduction, an exterior router must overcome the 15-
   hop limits imposed by both DDP and RTMP. To overcome RTMP's 15-hop
   limit, an exterior router should represent all networks accessible
   through the tunnel to routers in its local internet as one hop away
   when hop-count reduction is active on a tunneling port. This allows
   routers to maintain and send routing information about networks
   beyond the 15-hop limit and achieve full connectivity.

   Constraints on Hop-Count Reduction

   An interdomain loop exists when a redundant path connects two parts
   of an internet that are connected through two exterior routers on a
   tunnel.  The proper operation of hop-count reduction requires that no
   interdomain loops exist across a tunnel. For detailed information
   about interdomain loops see the next section, "Routing Loops."

   Because network-number remapping requires that no interdomain loops
   exist on the internet, an exterior router can perform hop-count
   reduction whenever network-number remapping is active, without any
   risk of a packet being forwarded in an infinite routing loop.
   Generally, an exterior router should not perform loop detection when
   network-number remapping is inactive.

   Routing Loops

   A routing loop exists when more than one path connects two exterior
   routers-both the path through the tunnel and a path through the
   exterior routers' local internets. When network-number remapping is
   not active on an exterior router, a routing loop can provide an
   alternative path to a network. However, when network-number remapping
   or hop-count reduction is active on an exterior router, all exterior
   routers must avoid establishing loops across the tunnel. Otherwise,
   if a routing loop went undetected, multiple routing-table entries
   that referred to the same actual AppleTalk networks using different
   remapping ranges might fill the routing tables of all of the exterior
   routers on a tunnel.

   First-Order Loops

   In a first-order loop, a pair of exterior routers that are performing
   network-number remapping across a tunnel are also connected through



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 67]</span></pre>

   another path, on which there are no remapping exterior routers. In
   Figure 4-5, exterior routers A and B are remapping network numbers
   across an AppleTalk tunnel, and exterior router C-which is not
   remapping network numbers-creates a first-order routing loop.
   Exterior router A's network range, 1 through 4, loops back to it
   through the tunnel and may be remapped again.

                    &lt;&lt;Figure 4-5  A first-order loop&gt;&gt;

   Second-Order Loops

   In a second-order loop, one or more additional pairs of remapping
   exterior routers are in the loop. In Figure 4-6, exterior routers A
   and B are remapping network numbers across the AppleTalk tunnel that
   connects them, and another pair of exterior routers, C1 and C2-which
   are also performing remapping across the tunnel that connects them-
   creates a second-order routing loop. Exterior router A's network
   range, 1 through 4, is remapped by exterior router C2 to the network
   range 101 through 104, then loops back to exterior router A through
   the tunnel.

                    &lt;&lt;Figure 4-6  A second-order loop&gt;&gt;

   Self-Caused and Externally Caused Loops

   Routing loops can be either self-caused or externally caused. A self-
   caused loop results when the detecting exterior router itself comes
   on line. An externally caused loop results when another router comes
   on line somewhere on the internet, after the detecting router has
   been running for some time.

   Loop-Detection Process

   The following sections describe the phases of the minimal loop-
   detection process that an exterior router must employ when either
   network-number remapping or hop-count reduction is active. An
   exterior router can implement an enhanced loop-detection scheme.

   LOOP-INDICATIVE ROUTING INFORMATION: A remapping exterior router
   should always examine routing information received through a tunnel
   for indications that a routing loop may exist. Loop-indicative
   routing information appears to refer to networks across the tunnel.
   However, it may actually refer to networks in the exterior router's
   own local internet if the networks' routing information has looped
   back through the tunnel.

   In the following definition of loop-indicative information,




<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 68]</span></pre>

      the network range for the network connected to a given port of an
      exterior router is referred to as ns through ne

      the zone list for that network is referred to as z1 through zn

   The routing information that a remapping exterior router receives
   through a tunneling port is loop indicative if both of the following
   conditions are true for some port on the router:

      The size of the network range in the routing information is ne-
      ns+1.

      The zone list in the routing information consists precisely of z1
      through zn.

   Thus, the routing information could represent a remapping of the
   network range for a network connected directly to one of the exterior
   router's ports.

   An exterior router most commonly receives loop-indicative information
   at startup when the process of bringing up the tunnel may create a
   self-caused loop. An exterior router may also receive loop-indicative
   information if another router connects two AppleTalk domains that are
   already connected through the tunnel and creates an externally caused
   loop.

   If a remapping exterior router receives loop-indicative routing
   information through a tunnel, it should start a loop-investigation
   process. For information about the loop-investigation process, see
   the next section, "Loop-Investigation Process."

   LOOP-INVESTIGATION PROCESS: To confirm or deny the existence of a
   suspected loop, an exterior router performs a loop-investigation
   process, in which it sends an AppleTalk data packet out the tunneling
   port, then observes whether that packet loops back through a port
   connected to its local internet. The exterior router sends the packet
   to the address corresponding to its own address on the network that
   it suspects may actually be a shadow copy of a network connected
   directly to one of its ports.

   LOOP PROBE PACKET: A Loop Probe packet is an AppleTalk data packet
   that an exterior router sends out a tunneling port to confirm or deny
   the existence of a loop. It is a new type of RTMP packet and has the
   function code 4. Figure 4-7 shows the format of a Loop Probe packet.

   The source node ID and source network number in a Loop Probe packet



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 69]</span></pre>

   should be those of the port for which the exterior router received
   loop-indicative information. An exterior router can send a Loop Probe
   packet through any socket.

   A Loop Probe packet's destination network number is the network
   number to which that port's network number would be remapped if the
   loop-indicative information were actually a shadow copy of that
   port's routing information. Refer to the port's actual network number
   as nu(ns&lt;=nu&lt;=ne). If the network range in the loop-indicative
   information were rs through re, the packet's destination network
   number would be rs+nu-ns.

   A Loop Probe packet's destination node ID is that of the exterior
   router on the port for which the exterior router received loop-
   indicative information. The packet's destination socket is socket 1-
   the RTMP socket.

   A Loop Probe packet's data field always begins with a long word that
   has the value 0. The remainder of the data field should contain
   information that the exterior router that sends the packet can use to
   identify that packet if it receives the packet through its local
   internet. An exterior router might receive a Loop Probe packet sent
   by another exterior router if a loop did not actually exist and the
   other exterior router sent a Loop Probe packet to a random node on
   the internet rather than to itself. The node receiving the Loop Probe
   packet might be an exterior router that also sent a Loop Probe
   packet. To prevent an exterior router that receives such a Loop Probe
   packet from falsely concluding that a loop exists, the exterior
   router sending the packet must insert sufficient data in that
   packet's data field to allow it to recognize the packet as the one it
   sent.

   An exterior router initiating a loop-investigation process should
   forward a Loop Probe packet through the tunnel to the next internet
   router for the packet's destination network-just as it would any
   other AppleTalk data packet. This next internet router should always
   be the exterior router that sent the loop-indicative information.

   A remapping exterior router forwarding a Loop Probe packet into its
   local internet must process that packet differently from other
   AppleTalk data packets in one way. If the exterior router's remapping
   database does not include the source network number in the packet's
   DDP header, the exterior router should forward the packet without
   remapping the source network number. At startup, remapping
   information is generally unavailable. However, the absence of
   remapping information should not affect the loop-detection process.

   If a loop exists, the exterior router that originally sent the Loop

   Probe packet receives that packet through its local internet. The
   data in the packet remains unchanged. The exterior router can use
   that data to confirm the existence of a loop on the internet.

   If a Loop Probe packet returns to the exterior router through the
   tunnel out which it was sent, a loop exists between two other
   exterior routers on the tunnel, but does not involve the exterior
   router that sent the packet. The sending router need take no action.

   An exterior router should send a Loop Probe packet at least four
   times.  The retransmission timeout should be no less than two
   seconds. Once the exterior router has retransmitted a Loop Probe
   packet four times and that packet has not returned to the exterior
   router through its local internet, the exterior router determines
   that no loop exists.

   If the exterior router receives a Loop Probe packet containing the
   correct data field through its local internet, this confirms the
   existence of a loop. The exterior router should deactivate the
   tunneling port, log an error, and set the state of all routing-table
   entries for exterior routers connected to that tunnel to BAD.

   NOTE:  The exterior router need not deactivate a tunneling port on
   which it detects a loop. However, the exterior router must disconnect
   with the exterior router that sent the loop-indicative information.
   However, disconnecting from only that exterior router might
   inadvertently result in a partially connected tunnel or in a lack of
   connectivity through the tunnel that would be difficult to detect.

   LIMITATIONS OF LOOP DETECTION: This loop-detection process becomes
   ineffective if, at some point in the loop, another exterior router

      hides networks connected directly to the ports of the exterior
      router that sent the Loop Probe packet

      clusters the network ranges of networks connected directly to the
      exterior router's ports

      is not remapping network numbers-resulting in partial network-
      number remapping

   In such cases, the exterior router that initiated the loop-detection
   process may never receive loop-indicative information, even though a
   loop exists.

   Using Alternative Paths

   AURP provides two mechanisms that allow a network administrator to

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   configure a port on an exterior router to forward packets over an
   alternative path to a network only when the primary path to that
   network is unavailable:

      hop-count weighting

      backup paths

   By configuring hop-count weighting on a port or configuring a port as
   a backup path, an administrator can reduce the amount of traffic on a
   slow point-to-point link or tunnel. These mechanisms are also
   available on links using RTMP.

   Hop-Count Weighting

   A network administrator can configure hop-count weighting on a port
   to increase the routing distance through a port by counting a link to
   another exterior router as more than one hop. Increasing the routing
   distance through a port may cause traffic to traverse an alternative
   path. The routers on an internet forward packets over an alternative
   path to a network if

      an alternative path is available

      the perceived distance to that network is shorter over the
      alternative path

   However, a network administrator should not set the hop-count weight
   for a link so high that distances between networks across that link
   exceed the limit of 15 hops. Otherwise, if the link on which hop-
   count weighting was active were the only available path, the exterior
   router would be unable to provide full connectivity to all networks
   on the internet.

   To implement hop-count weighting, an exterior router should make the
   following changes to RTMP and the DDP routing process:

      When an exterior router uses RTMP or AURP to broadcast the
      networks that are accessible through a link on which hop-count
      weighting is active, the distance attributed to each network should
      equal its actual distance plus the hop-count weight specified.

      Before an exterior router forwards a DDP data packet to a network
      across that link, it should add the specified hop-count weight to the
      value in the hop-count field of the packet's DDP header.

   Backup Paths

   A network administrator can configure a port on an exterior router as
   a backup path. The routers on an internet forward AppleTalk data
   packets across a backup path only when an exterior router on which a
   port is configured as a backup path determines that no other path to
   a specific network or networks is available.

   Regardless of the distance that routing packets must traverse across
   a primary path to a network, routers on the internet use the primary
   path as long as it remains available. When the exterior router on
   which a port is configured as a backup path determines that the
   primary path to a network is no longer available and that network is
   accessible across the backup path, the exterior router broadcasts
   routing information about networks accessible across the backup path
   to its local internet.

   NOTE:  An exterior router at each end of the backup path maintains a
   complete routing table for the entire internet, and sends AURP or
   RTMP routing packets across the backup path, regardless of whether
   the backup path is in use.

   If an exterior router is currently providing access to a network
   through a backup path and the primary path to that network again
   becomes available, the exterior router starts broadcasting routing
   information that indicates the primary path to the network, rather
   than the backup path. The routers on the exterior router's local
   internet can again use the primary path to that network.

   PROBLEMS REACTIVATING THE PRIMARY PATH: When an exterior router is
   providing access to a network through a backup path and the primary
   path to that network again becomes available, it is possible that the
   exterior router may not become aware that the primary path is
   available.  This can occur when other routers in the exterior
   router's local internet use the backup path, rather than a newly
   available primary path, because the backup path traverses a shorter
   distance. The other routers have no way of knowing that an active
   path is a backup path.  They do not notify the exterior router
   connected to the shorter backup path about the primary path's
   availability.

   Once the primary path becomes unavailable and routers on the internet
   use the backup path, reconfiguring the exterior router so it will
   again use the primary path may be necessary.

   Network Management

   A Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 73]</span></pre>

   Base (MIB) allows the remote management of tunneling, routing-
   information propagation, and the representation of wide area routing
   information.  Refer to the "IETF Draft: Macintosh System MIB" on
   E.T.O. for detailed information about the structure and content of
   AURP's many remotely manageable parameters.

   Network-Number Remapping and Network Management

   The packets of network-management protocols-regardless of whether
   SNMP forms their basis-often contain information about specific
   AppleTalk network numbers. An exterior router cannot remap network
   numbers in data. Therefore, when querying devices across a tunnel,
   network-management protocols always return network numbers that have
   not been remapped. However, a remote network-management station using
   SNMP could use the AURP MIB to query a remapping exterior router to
   obtain remapped network numbers from the exterior router's remapping
   database.

   Network Hiding and Network Management

   Even though an exterior router is hiding a network from a particular
   port, that network's routing information should be available to a
   network-management station across that port. Network hiding should
   not affect network management. Thus, an exterior router should still
   return routing information for hidden networks in responses to
   network-management queries. A network-management station using SNMP
   could use the AURP MIB to query an exterior router to obtain
   information about hidden networks.

   Unaffected Network-Management Packets

   Network-management packets that network-number remapping and network
   hiding should not affect include:

      SNMP requests received through an AURP port

      SNMP responses sent through an AURP port

      RTMP responses sent through an AURP port

      Route Data responses sent through an AURP port

      ZIP queries received through an AURP port

      ZIP requests received through an AURP port

      ZIP replies sent through an AURP port

APPENDIX:  IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

   This appendix provides information that may assist you in
   implementing AURP. It does not specify protocol requirements.

   Developers implementing AURP routers may want to purchase the Apple
   Internet Router, a product of Apple Computer. The Apple Internet
   Router provides many additional examples of how you might implement
   the various features of AURP.

   State Diagrams

   Figure A-1 shows the state diagram for the AURP data receiver.

             &lt;&lt;Figure A-1  AURP data receiver state diagram&gt;&gt;

   Figure A-2 shows the state diagram for the AURP data sender.

              &lt;&lt;Figure A-2  AURP data sender state diagram&gt;&gt;

   AURP Table Overflow

   It is possible for an AURP data receiver to have insufficient storage
   capacity to maintain all of the routing information sent to it by a
   peer data sender. Because the data sender does not retransmit routing
   information, the data receiver should set a flag indicating that a
   table-overflow condition exists. If additional storage later becomes
   available, the data receiver should try to obtain the missing
   information. If zone information is lost, the data receiver can
   obtain complete zone information by sending the appropriate ZI-Req
   packets. If network information is lost, the data receiver should
   send an RI-Req to obtain the complete routing table.

   A Scheme for Updates Following Initial Information Exchange

   As described in the section "Sending Updates Following the Initial
   Exchange of Routing Information" in Chapter 3, an exterior router
   must present complete and accurate routing information to all
   exterior routers, even if a new connection is established with that
   exterior router when the exterior router has update events pending-
   that is, update events not yet sent in RI-Upd packets. This section
   details one scheme for presenting routing information to both new and
   old connections correctly, even if multiple update events occur for a
   given network in an update period during which the exterior router
   establishes new connections. More complex schemes could provide more
   up-to-date information, at the cost of greater implementational
   complexity.




<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 75]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-76" id="page-76" name="page-76"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   Assume that an exterior router has a number of AURP connections
   established with other routers and that a series of update events for
   a given network occur in the exterior router's local internet. Once
   these events have occurred, but before the update interval expires-
   that is, before the exterior router sends RI-Upd packets over its
   connections-the exterior router establishes a new AURP connection
   with another exterior router and receives an RI-Req packet from that
   exterior router. This section describes the information about the
   network that the RI-Rsp packet should contain. It also describes the
   update event that the exterior router should send in the next RI-Upd
   packet, assuming that it receives no additional update events for the
   network.

   Two scenarios are possible. In the first scenario, a network for
   which the exterior router is not exporting information at the
   beginning of an update interval either comes up in the exterior
   router's local internet, or a new path to the network that is shorter
   than the path through the tunnel comes up in the exterior router's
   local internet. In either case, the RI-Rsp packet should not include
   the new network.

   By not including the new network in the RI-Rsp, the implementation
   can simply continue to follow the state diagram provided in the
   section "Sending Routing Information Update Packets" in Chapter 3. If
   only an NDC event or no additional update event occurs for the
   network, the next RI-Upd packet that the exterior router sends on
   both old and new connections should contain an NA event for the
   network. If an NRC or ND event occurs for the network, the exterior
   router should not include an event tuple for the network in the RI-
   Upd. This sequence matches the state diagram precisely. If the RI-Rsp
   did contain information about the network, new connections would
   require a different state diagram.

   In the second scenario, the exterior router initially exports
   information for a network, then an update event occurs for that
   network.  In all cases, the RI-Rsp packet should contain up-to-date
   information about the network from the exterior router's central
   routing table, and the next RI-Upd packet should contain the specific
   event that the state table indicates for that network. For example,
   if an ND or NRC event occurs for the network, the network should not
   be included in the RI-Rsp, while if an NDC event occurs, it should be
   included in the RI-Rsp.

   This scheme may result in some exterior routers receiving unexpected
   update events, which they must process as specified in the section
   "Processing Inconsistent Update Events" in Chapter 3. For example,
   another exterior router with which the exterior router establishes a
   new connection might receive an ND or NRC event for a network of



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 76]</span></pre>

   which it was unaware. The receiving exterior router would ignore the
   event.

   In an alternative way of evaluating and possibly implementing this
   scheme, the information for a given network that is sent in the
   initial RI-Rsp packet depends on the particular update event that is
   pending for that network when the exterior router sends the RI-Rsp.
   Specifically, an exterior router should include a network for which
   it has an update event pending in the RI-Rsp packet only if the
   pending update event is an NDC. Otherwise, the exterior router should
   not include the network in the RI-Rsp. Following this RI-Rsp, the
   exterior router sends RI-Upd packets as usual, which include other
   pending events, as necessary.

   Implementation Effort for Different Components of AURP

   AURP contains various enhancements to AppleTalk routing. The only
   components of AURP that are required are those specified in Chapter
   3.  The required components of AURP provide the functionality needed
   to replace RTMP and ZIP, completely and compatibly, on tunnels and
   point-to-point links, without losing any functionality and with
   greatly reduced routing traffic. Optional features of AURP provide
   functionality beyond that of RTMP and ZIP. This functionality is
   especially useful in a wide area network environment.

   The chart shown in Figure A-3 provides rough estimates of the
   percentage of development time needed to implement, debug, and test
   the various components of a complete AURP implementation. It can
   provide developers with some idea of the implementational complexity
   of these components and help developers make tradeoffs between
   features and development time.

              &lt;&lt;Figure A-3  Implementation effort for AURP&gt;&gt;

   Creating Free-Trade Zones

   A useful feature of AURP is that it allows a network administrator to
   create free-trade zones. A free-trade zone is a part of an internet
   that is accessible by two other parts of the internet, neither of
   which can access the other. An administrator might create a free-
   trade zone to provide some form of interchange between two
   organizations that otherwise want to keep their internets isolated
   from each other, or between two organizations that otherwise do not
   have physical connectivity with one another.

   AURP allows the creation of free-trade zones in two ways. In one
   method, described in the section "Fully Connected and Partially
   Connected Tunnels" in Chapter 2, an administrator intentionally



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 77]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-78" id="page-78" name="page-78"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   creates a partially connected tunnel. The administrator configures
   the exterior router to connect with two exterior routers between
   which a free-trade zone is to be established, but does not configure
   those exterior routers to connect with one another.

   The second method of using AURP to create a free-trade zone involves
   the use of network hiding. An administrator can configure a single
   router to create a free-trade zone. No AURP tunnel need exist. As
   shown in Figure A-4, three ports are configured on a router. One port
   connects to the free-trade zone, while the other two ports connect to
   the parts of the internets that are otherwise isolated from one
   another.

                 &lt;&lt;Figure A-4  Creating free-trade zones&gt;&gt;

   On the port connected to the free-trade zone, the administrator does
   not configure the router to hide any networks. The exterior router
   exports all networks from both organizations to the free-trade zone.
   On each port connected to an organization's internet, the
   administrator configures the router to export only the networks from
   the free-trade zone. The exterior router hides all the networks from
   the other organization's internet. In this way, each organization has
   access to the networks in the free-trade zone, and vice versa, but
   not to the networks in the other organization's internet.

   Implementation Details for Clustering

   The data structures that an exterior router uses to maintain
   information about clustering are key to the implementation of
   clustering. An exterior router should

      maintain mappings between the actual domain identifier and network
      range; the remapped network range; and the associated cluster

      maintain zone lists for each actual network and for the cluster as
      a whole

      use data structures that allow parts of the information to be
      marked for deletion, while maintaining that information for possible
      later reuse-for example, if a network goes down, then comes back up

      use data structures that are bidirectional-supporting both the
      conversion of a single FwdReq into multiple FwdReq packets and the
      manipulation of individual networks within the cluster

   An exterior router can cluster any network numbers that is has
   remapped into an available range of contiguous network numbers. From
   both an implementation and a management point of view, it is



<span class="grey">Oppenheimer                                                    [Page 78]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-79" id="page-79" name="page-79"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1504.html">RFC 1504</a>        Appletalk Update-Based Routing Protocol      August 1993</span>


   generally best for an exterior router to cluster all network numbers
   that it receives from a particular exterior router at a given time.
   For example, it may be desirable to cluster all of the network
   numbers included in the initial information exchange with a
   particular exterior router, then later, to cluster all of the network
   numbers received in NA events in a given RI- Upd packet.

   Maintaining compatibility with AppleTalk Phase 2 complicates the
   implementation of clustering. An exterior router can include a
   maximum of 255 zones in a cluster. This limit may prevent the
   exterior router from clustering all of the network numbers that it
   receives at one time.  When an exterior router receives a list of
   networks from another exterior router, it does not know how many
   different zone names the networks use. The exterior router does not
   have this information until it receives the associated ZI-Rsp
   packets. Therefore, an exterior router should not build a cluster
   until it has received a complete zone list for the network numbers
   being clustered. Once the exterior router has complete zone
   information for the network numbers, it can cluster the maximum
   number of network numbers allowed by the 255 zone limit.

   AURP does not specify the method by which an exterior router, when
   forming a cluster, should determine the hop count for that cluster-
   that is, the apparent distance in hops to the single extended network
   that represents the cluster. Possible implementation options include

      always setting the hop count to a constant value

      setting the hop count to the minimum, average, or maximum of the
      hop counts for the networks within the cluster

   In a large internet, setting the hop count for a cluster too high may
   make the networks in that cluster unreachable from some networks in
   the local internet of the exterior router that is clustering the
   network numbers.

   Modified RTMP Algorithms for a Backup Path

   In the following RTMP maintenance algorithms defined in Inside
   AppleTalk, the backup path is an RTMP link. These algorithms can be
   adapted to AURP according to the architectural model described in the
   section "AURP Architectural Model" in Chapter 3. Proposed
   modifications to these algorithms appear in boldface Courier font.

   An exterior router uses the Create-New-Tentative-Entry algorithm when
   it discovers a previously unknown network across a backup path. An
   exterior router should not add an entry to the routing table being
   broadcast to its local internet until it determines definitely that
   no alternative path to a network is available. While waiting for
   another path to a network to become available, the exterior router
   temporarily stores the routing-table entry in a tentative routing
   table, as defined by the following algorithm:

   Create-New-Tentative-Entry

   IF tentative entry for tuple's network number range does not
        already exist
        THEN BEGIN
             Tentative entry's network number range =
                  tuple's network number range;
             Tentative entry's distance := tuple's distance;
             Tentative entry's next IR = packet's node address;
             Tentative entry's port := P;
             Start a TBD-minute timer for this entry;
        END;
   WHEN timer for this entry expires
        IF there is a table entry corresponding to or
             overlapping with the tentative entry's network
             number range
             THEN ignore the entry
        ELSE Create-New-Entry; {using data from the tentative
             entry}
        Delete tentative entry;

Security Considerations

   This memo discusses a weak form of security called network hiding or
   device hiding.  More general concerns about security are not
   addressed.
