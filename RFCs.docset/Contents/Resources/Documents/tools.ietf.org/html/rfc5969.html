Abstract

   This document specifies an automatic tunneling mechanism tailored to
   advance deployment of IPv6 to end users via a service provider's IPv4
   network infrastructure.  Key aspects include automatic IPv6 prefix
   delegation to sites, stateless operation, simple provisioning, and
   service, which is equivalent to native IPv6 at the sites that are
   served by the mechanism.

   The original idea and the name of the mechanism (6rd) described in
   [<a href="rfc5569.html" title='"IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd)"'>RFC5569</a>] details a successful commercial "rapid deployment" of the
   6rd mechanism by a residential service provider and is recommended
   reading.  This document describes the 6rd mechanism, which has been
   extended for use in more general environments.  Throughout this
   document, the term 6to4 is used to refer to the mechanism described
   in [<a href="rfc3056.html" title='"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds"'>RFC3056</a>] and 6rd is the mechanism defined herein.

   6rd specifies a protocol mechanism to deploy IPv6 to sites via a
   service provider's (SP's) IPv4 network.  It builds on 6to4 [<a href="rfc3056.html" title='"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds"'>RFC3056</a>],
   with the key differentiator that it utilizes an SP's own IPv6 address
   prefix rather than a well-known prefix (2002::/16).  By using the
   SP's IPv6 prefix, the operational domain of 6rd is limited to the SP
   network and is under its direct control.  From the perspective of
   customer sites and the IPv6 Internet at large, the IPv6 service
   provided is equivalent to native IPv6.

   The 6rd mechanism relies upon an algorithmic mapping between the IPv6
   and IPv4 addresses that are assigned for use within the SP network.
   This mapping allows for automatic determination of IPv4 tunnel
   endpoints from IPv6 prefixes, allowing stateless operation of 6rd.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5969.html">RFC 5969</a>                           6rd                       August 2010</span>


   6rd views the IPv4 network as a link layer for IPv6 and supports an
   automatic tunneling abstraction similar to the Non-Broadcast Multiple
   Access (NBMA) [<a href="rfc2491.html" title='"IPv6 over Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) networks"'>RFC2491</a>] model.

   A 6rd domain consists of 6rd Customer Edge (CE) routers and one or
   more 6rd Border Relays (BRs).  IPv6 packets encapsulated by 6rd
   follow the IPv4 routing topology within the SP network among CEs and
   BRs. 6rd BRs are traversed only for IPv6 packets that are destined to
   or are arriving from outside the SP's 6rd domain.  As 6rd is
   stateless, BRs may be reached using anycast for failover and
   resiliency (in a similar fashion to [<a href="rfc3068.html" title='"An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers"'>RFC3068</a>]).

   On the "customer-facing" (i.e., "LAN") side of a CE, IPv6 is
   implemented as it would be for any native IP service delivered by the
   SP, and further considerations for IPv6 operation on the LAN side of
   the CE is out of scope for this document.  On the "SP-facing" (i.e.,
   "WAN") side of the 6rd CE, the WAN interface itself, encapsulation
   over Ethernet, ATM or PPP, as well as control protocols such as
   PPPoE, IPCP, DHCP, etc. all remain unchanged from current IPv4
   operation.  Although 6rd was designed primarily to support IPv6
   deployment to a customer site (such as a residential home network) by
   an SP, it can equally be applied to an individual IPv6 host acting as
   a CE.

   6rd relies on IPv4 and is designed to deliver production-quality IPv6
   alongside IPv4 with as little change to IPv4 networking and
   operations as possible.  Native IPv6 deployment within the SP network
   itself may continue for the SP's own purposes while delivering IPv6
   service to sites supported by 6rd.  Once the SP network and
   operations can support fully native IPv6 access and transport, 6rd
   may be discontinued.

   6rd utilizes the same encapsulation and base mechanism as 6to4 and
   could be viewed as a superset of 6to4 (6to4 could be achieved by
   setting the 6rd prefix to 2002::/16).  Unlike 6to4, 6rd is for use
   only in an environment where a service provider closely manages the
   delivery of IPv6 service. 6to4 routes with the 2002::/16 prefix may
   exist alongside 6rd in the 6rd CE router, and doing so may offer some
   efficiencies when communicating directly with 6to4 routers.

   The 6rd link model can be extended to support IPv6 multicast.  IPv6
   multicast support is left for future consideration.

   How this mechanism should be used and other deployment and
   operational considerations are considered out of scope for this

   6rd prefix            An IPv6 prefix selected by the service provider
                         for use by a 6rd domain.  There is exactly one
                         6rd prefix for a given 6rd domain.  An SP may
                         deploy 6rd with a single 6rd domain or multiple
                         6rd domains.

   6rd Customer Edge (6rd CE)  A device functioning as a Customer Edge
                               router in a 6rd deployment.  In a
                               residential broadband deployment, this
                               type of device is sometimes referred to
                               as a "Residential Gateway" (RG) or
                               "Customer Premises Equipment" (CPE).  A
                               typical 6rd CE serving a residential site
                               has one WAN side interface, one or more
                               LAN side interfaces, and a 6rd virtual
                               interface.  A 6rd CE may also be referred
                               to simply as a "CE" within the context of
                               6rd.

   6rd delegated prefix  The IPv6 prefix calculated by the CE for use
                         within the customer site by combining the 6rd
                         prefix and the CE IPv4 address obtained via
                         IPv4 configuration methods.  This prefix can be
                         considered logically equivalent to a DHCPv6
                         IPv6 delegated prefix [<a href="rfc3633.html" title='"IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6"'>RFC3633</a>].

   6rd domain            A set of 6rd CEs and BRs connected to the same
                         virtual 6rd link.  A service provider may
                         deploy 6rd with a single 6rd domain, or may
                         utilize multiple 6rd domains.  Each domain
                         requires a separate 6rd prefix.

   CE LAN side           The functionality of a 6rd CE that serves the
                         "Local Area Network (LAN)" or "customer-facing"
                         side of the CE.  The CE LAN side interface is
                         fully IPv6 enabled.

   CE WAN side           The functionality of a 6rd CE that serves the
                         "Wide Area Network (WAN)" or "Service Provider-
                         facing" side of the CE.  The CE WAN side is
                         IPv4-only.

   6rd Border Relay (BR) A 6rd-enabled router managed by the service
                         provider at the edge of a 6rd domain.  A Border
                         Relay router has at least one of each of the
                         following: an IPv4-enabled interface, a 6rd
                         virtual interface acting as an endpoint for the
                         6rd IPv6 in IPv4 tunnel, and an IPv6 interface
                         connected to the native IPv6 network.  A 6rd BR
                         may also be referred to simply as a "BR" within
                         the context of 6rd.

   BR IPv4 address       The IPv4 address of the 6rd Border Relay for a
                         given 6rd domain.  This IPv4 address is used by
                         the CE to send packets to a BR in order to
                         reach IPv6 destinations outside of the 6rd
                         domain.

   6rd virtual interface Internal multi-point tunnel interface where 6rd
                         encapsulation and decapsulation of IPv6 packets
                         inside IPv4 occurs.  A typical CE or BR
                         implementation requires only one 6rd virtual
                         interface.  A BR operating in multiple 6rd
                         domains may require more than one 6rd virtual
                         interface, but no more than one per 6rd domain.

   CE IPv4 address       The IPv4 address given to the CE as part of
                         normal IPv4 Internet access (i.e., configured
                         via DHCP, PPP, or otherwise).  This address may
                         be global or private [<a href="rfc1918.html" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>] within the 6rd
                         domain.  This address is used by a 6rd CE to
                         create the 6rd delegated prefix as well as to
                         send and receive IPv4-encapsulated IPv6
                         packets.

   The 6rd delegated prefix for use at a customer site is created by
   combining the 6rd prefix and all or part of the CE IPv4 address.
   From these elements, the 6rd delegated prefix is automatically
   created by the CE for the customer site when IPv4 service is
   obtained.  This 6rd delegated prefix is used in the same manner as a
   prefix obtained via DHCPv6 prefix delegation [<a href="rfc3633.html" title='"IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6"'>RFC3633</a>].

   In 6to4, a similar operation is performed by incorporating an entire
   IPv4 address at a fixed location following a well-known /16 IPv6
   prefix.  In 6rd, the IPv6 prefix as well as the position and number
   of bits of the IPv4 address incorporated varies from one 6rd domain
   to the next. 6rd allows the SP to adjust the size of the 6rd prefix,
   how many bits are used by the 6rd mechanism, and how many bits are
   left to be delegated to customer sites.  To allow for stateless
   address auto-configuration on the CE LAN side, a 6rd delegated prefix
   SHOULD be /64 or shorter.

   The 6rd delegated prefix is created by concatenating the 6rd prefix
   and a consecutive set of bits from the CE IPv4 address in order.  The
   length of the 6rd delegated prefix is equal to length of the 6rd
   prefix (n) plus the number of bits from the CE IPv4 address (o).

   The figure shows the format of an IPv6 address (<a href="rfc4291.html#section-2.5.4">Section 2.5.4 of
   [RFC4291]</a>) with a 6rd prefix and an embedded CE IPv4 address:

   |     n bits    |    o bits    |   m bits  |    128-n-o-m bits      |
   +---------------+--------------+-----------+------------------------+
   |  6rd prefix   | IPv4 address | subnet ID |     interface ID       |
   +---------------+--------------+-----------+------------------------+
   |&lt;--- 6rd delegated prefix ---&gt;|

                                 Figure 1

   For example, if the 6rd prefix is /32 and 24 bits of the CE IPv4
   address is used (e.g., all CE IPv4 addresses can be aggregated by a
   10.0.0.0/8), then the size of the 6rd delegated prefix for each CE is
   automatically calculated to be /56 (32 + 24 = 56).

   Embedding less than the full 32 bits of a CE IPv4 address is possible
   only when an aggregated block of IPv4 addresses is available for a
   given 6rd domain.  This may not be practical with global IPv4
   addresses, but is quite likely in a deployment where private
   addresses are being assigned to CEs.  If private addresses overlap
   within a given 6rd deployment, the deployment may be divided into
   separate 6rd domains, likely along the same topology lines the NAT-
   based IPv4 deployment itself would require.  In this case, each
   domain is addressed with a different 6rd prefix.

   Each 6rd domain may use a different encoding of the embedded IPv4
   address, even within the same service provider.  For example, if
   multiple IPv4 address blocks with different levels of aggregation are
   used at the same service provider, the number of IPv4 bits needed to
   encode the 6rd delegated prefix may vary between each block.  In this
   case, different 6rd prefixes, and hence separate 6rd domains, may be
   used to support the different encodings.

   Since 6rd delegated prefixes are selected algorithmically from an
   IPv4 address, changing the IPv4 address will cause a change in the
   IPv6 delegated prefix which would ripple through the site's network
   and could be disruptive.  As such, it is recommended that the service
   provider assign CE IPv4 addresses with relatively long lifetimes.

   6rd IPv6 address assignment, and hence the IPv6 service itself, is
   tied to the IPv4 address lease; thus, the 6rd service is also tied to
   this in terms of authorization, accounting, etc.  For example, the
   6rd delegated prefix has the same lifetime as its associated IPv4
   address.  The prefix lifetimes advertised in Router Advertisements or
   used by DHCP on the CE LAN side MUST be equal to or shorter than the
   IPv4 address lease time.  If the IPv4 lease time is not known, the
   lifetime of the 6rd delegated prefix SHOULD follow the defaults
   specified in [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].

   A 6rd IPv6 address and associated IPv4 address for a given customer
   can always be determined algorithmically by the service provider that
   operates the given 6rd domain.  This may be useful for referencing
   logs and other data at a service provider that may have more robust
   operational tools for IPv4 than IPv6.  This also allows IPv4 data
   path, node, and endpoint monitoring to be applicable to IPv6.

   The 6rd CE and BR SHOULD support the IPv6 Subnet-Router anycast
   address [<a href="rfc4291.html" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>RFC4291</a>] for its own 6rd delegated prefix.  This allows, for
   example, IPv6 ICMP echo messages to be sent to the 6rd virtual
   interface itself for additional troubleshooting of the internal
   operation of 6rd at a given CE or BR.  In the case of the BR, the
   IPv4 address used to calculate the 6rd delegated prefix is the
   configured BR IPv4 address.

   All addresses assigned from 6rd delegated prefixes should be treated
   as native IPv6.  No changes to the source address selection or
   destination address selection policy table [<a href="rfc3484.html" title='"Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC3484</a>] are necessary.

   For a given 6rd domain, the BR and CE MUST be configured with the
   following four 6rd elements.  The configured values for these four
   6rd elements are identical for all CEs and BRs within a given 6rd
   domain.

   IPv4MaskLen         The number of high-order bits that are identical
                       across all CE IPv4 addresses within a given 6rd

                       used), IPv4MaskLen is equal to 8 and IPv4MaskLen
                       high-order bits are stripped from the IPv4

   The four 6rd elements are set to values that are the same across all
   CEs within a 6rd domain.  The values may be configured in a variety
   of manners, including provisioning methods such as the Broadband
   Forum's "TR-69" [<a href="#ref-TR069" title='"TR-069, CPE WAN Management Protocol v1.1, Version: Issue 1 Amendment 2"'>TR069</a>] Residential Gateway management interface, an
   XML-based object retrieved after IPv4 connectivity is established, a
   DNS record, an SMIv2 MIB [<a href="rfc2578.html" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], PPP IPCP, or manual configuration
   by an administrator.  This document describes how to configure the
   necessary parameters via a single DHCP option.  A CE that allows IPv4
   configuration by DHCP SHOULD implement this option.  Other
   configuration and management methods may use the format described by
   this option for consistency and convenience of implementation on CEs
   that support multiple configuration methods.

   The only remaining provisioning information the CE requires in order
   to calculate the 6rd delegated prefix and enable IPv6 connectivity is
   an IPv4 address for the CE.  This CE IPv4 address is configured as
   part of obtaining IPv4 Internet access (i.e., configured via DHCP,
   PPP, or otherwise).  This address may be global or private [<a href="rfc1918.html" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>]
   within the 6rd domain.

   A single 6rd CE MAY be connected to more than one 6rd domain, just as
   any router may have more than one IPv6-enabled service provider
   facing interface and more than one set of associated delegated
   prefixes assigned by DHCPv6 prefix delegation or other means.  Each

   6rdPrefix           The service provider's 6rd IPv6 prefix
                       represented as a 16-octet IPv6 address.  The bits
                       in the prefix after the 6rdPrefixlen number of
                       bits are reserved and MUST be initialized to zero
                       by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

   The CE MUST include a Parameter Request List Option [<a href="rfc2132.html" title='"DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions"'>RFC2132</a>] for the
   OPTION_6RD.  Because the OPTION_6RD contains one IPv4MaskLen/
   6rdPrefixLen/6rdPrefix block, and because DHCP cannot convey more
   than one instance of an option, OPTION_6RD is limited to provision at
   most a single 6rd domain.  Provisioning of a CE router connected to
   multiple 6rd domains is outside the scope of this protocol
   specification.

   The presence of the OPTION_6RD DHCP option is an indication of the
   availability of the 6rd service.  By default, receipt of a valid 6rd
   DHCP option by a 6rd-capable CE results in configuration of the 6rd
   virtual interface and associated delegated prefix for use on the CE's
   LAN side.  The CE MUST be able to configure the 6rd mechanism to be
   disabled, in which case the 6rd DHCP option, if received, is silently
   ignored.

   A detailed description of CE behavior using multiple BR IPv4
   addresses is left for future consideration.  In such a case, a CE
   MUST support at least one BR IPv4 address and MAY support more than
   one.

   When 6rd is enabled, a typical CE router will install a default route
   to the BR, a black hole route for the 6rd delegated prefix, and
   routes for any LAN side assigned and advertised prefixes.  For
   example, using a CE IPv4 address of 10.100.100.1, a BR IPv4 address
   of 10.0.0.1, an IPv4MaskLen of 8, 2001:db8::/32 as the 6rdPrefix, and
   one /64 prefix assigned to a LAN side interface, a typical CE routing
   table will look like:

     ::/0 -&gt; 6rd-virtual-int0 via 2001:db8:0:100:: (default route)
     2001:db8::/32 -&gt; 6rd-virtual-int0 (direct connect to 6rd)
     2001:db8:6464:100::/56 -&gt; Null0 (delegated prefix null route)
     2001:db8:6464:100::/64 -&gt; Ethernet0 (LAN interface)

   The 6rd BR MUST be configured with the same 6rd elements as the 6rd
   CEs operating within the same domain.

   For increased reliability and load balancing, the BR IPv4 address may
   be an anycast address shared across a given 6rd domain.  As 6rd is
   stateless, any BR may be used at any time.  If the BR IPv4 address is

   anycast the relay MUST use this anycast IPv4 address as the source
   address in packets relayed to CEs.

   Since 6rd uses provider address space, no specific routes need to be
   advertised externally for 6rd to operate, neither in IPv6 nor IPv4
   BGP.  However, if anycast is used for the 6rd IPv4 relays, the
   anycast addresses must be advertised in the service provider's IGP.

   Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) for tunnels is described in
   <a href="rfc4213.html#section-3.8">Section 3.8 of [RFC4213]</a>.  In 6rd, all CEs and BRs can be considered
   as connected to the same virtual link and therefore neighbors to each
   other.  This section describes how to utilize neighbor unreachability
   detection without negatively impacting the scalability of a 6rd
   deployment.

   A typical 6rd deployment may consist of a very large number of CEs
   within the same domain.  Reachability between CEs is based on IPv4
   routing, and sending NUD or any periodic packets between 6rd CE
   devices beyond isolated troubleshooting of the 6rd mechanism is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.

   While reachability detection between a given 6rd CE and BR is not
   necessary for the proper operation of 6rd, in cases where a CE has
   alternate paths for BR reachability to choose from, it could be
   useful.  Sending NUD messages to a BR, in particular periodic
   messages from a very large number of CEs, could result in overloading
   of the BR control message processing path, negatively affecting
   scalability of the 6rd deployment.  Instead, a CE that needs to
   determine BR reachability MUST utilize a method that allows
   reachability detection packets to follow a typical data forwarding
   path without special processing by the BR.  One such method is
   described below.

   1.  The CE constructs a payload of any size and content to be sent to
       the BR (e.g., a zero-length null payload, a padded payload
       designed to test a certain MTU, a NUD message, etc.).  The exact
       format of the message payload is not important as the BR will not
       be processing it directly.

   2.  The desired payload is encapsulated with the inner IPv6 and outer
       IPv4 headers as follows:

       *  The IPv6 destination address is set to an address from the
          CE's 6rd delegated prefix that is assigned to a virtual
          interface on the CE.




<span class="grey">Townsley &amp; Troan             Standards Track                   [Page 11]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5969.html">RFC 5969</a>                           6rd                       August 2010</span>


       *  The IPv6 source address is set to an address from the CE's 6rd
          delegated prefix as well, including the same as used for the
          IPv6 destination address.

       *  The IPv4 header is then added as it normally would be for any
          packet destined for the BR.  That is, the IPv4 destination
          address is that of the BR, and the source address is the CE
          IPv4 address.

   3.  The CE sends the constructed packet out the interface on which BR
       reachability is being monitored.  On successful receipt at the
       BR, the BR MUST decapsulate and forward the packet normally.
       That is, the IPv4 header is decapsulated normally, revealing the
       IPv6 destination as the CE, which in turn results in the packet
       being forwarded to that CE via the 6rd mechanism (i.e., the IPv4
       destination is that of the CE that originated the packet, and the
       IPv4 source is that of the BR).

   4.  Arrival of the constructed IPv6 packet at the CE's IPv6 address
       completes one round trip to and from the BR, without causing the
       BR to process the message outside of its normal data forwarding
       path.  The CE then processes the IPv6 packet accordingly
       (updating keepalive timers, metrics, etc.).

   The payload may be empty or could contain values that are meaningful
   to the CE.  Sending a proper NUD message could be convenient for some
   implementations (note that the BR will decrement the IPv6 hop limit).
   Since the BR forwards the packet as any other data packet without any
   processing of the payload itself, the format of the payload is left
   as a choice to the implementer.

   IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation and forwarding manipulations (e.g.,

   <a href="rfc4213.html#section-3.4">3.4 of [RFC4213]</a>.  By default, the IPv6 Traffic Class field MUST be

   Services and tunneling.

   IPv6 packets from a CE are encapsulated in IPv4 packets when they
   leave the site via its CE WAN side interface.  The CE IPv4 address
   MUST be configured to send and receive packets on this interface.

   The 6rd link is modeled as an NBMA link similar to other automatic
   IPv6 in IPv4 tunneling mechanisms like [<a href="rfc5214.html" title='"Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)"'>RFC5214</a>], with all 6rd CEs
   and BRs defined as off-link neighbors from one other.  The link-local
   address of a 6rd virtual interface performing the 6rd encapsulation
   would, if needed, be formed as described in <a href="rfc4213.html#section-3.7">Section 3.7 of [RFC4213]</a>.
   However, no communication using link-local addresses will occur.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.1.%20%20Maximum%20Transmission%20Unit"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.1" name="section-9.1">9.1</a>.  Maximum Transmission Unit</span>

   Maximum transmission unit (MTU) and fragmentation issues for IPv6 in
   IPv4 tunneling are discussed in detail in <a href="rfc4213.html#section-3.2">Section 3.2 of RFC 4213</a>
   [<a href="rfc4213.html" title='"Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers"'>RFC4213</a>]. 6rd's scope is limited to a service provider network.
   IPv4 Path MTU discovery MAY be used to adjust the MTU of the tunnel
   as described in <a href="rfc4213.html#section-3.2.2">Section 3.2.2 of RFC 4213</a> [<a href="rfc4213.html" title='"Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers"'>RFC4213</a>], or the 6rd
   Tunnel MTU might be explicitly configured.

   The use of an anycast source address could lead to any ICMP error
   message generated on the path being sent to a different BR.
   Therefore, using dynamic tunnel MTU <a href="rfc4213.html#section-3.2.2">Section 3.2.2 of [RFC4213]</a> is
   subject to IPv4 Path MTU blackholes.

   Multiple BRs using the same anycast source address could send
   fragmented packets to the same IPv6 CE at the same time.  If the
   fragmented packets from different BRs happen to use the same fragment
   ID, incorrect reassembly might occur.  For this reason, a BR using an
   anycast source address MUST set the IPv4 Don't Fragment flag.

   If the MTU is well-managed such that the IPv4 MTU on the CE WAN side
   interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs within the boundary
   of the SP, then the 6rd Tunnel MTU should be set to the known IPv4
   MTU minus the size of the encapsulating IPv4 header (20 bytes).  For
   example, if the IPv4 MTU is known to be 1500 bytes, the 6rd Tunnel
   MTU might be set to 1480 bytes.  Absent more specific information,
   the 6rd Tunnel MTU SHOULD default to 1280 bytes.

   In order to prevent spoofing of IPv6 addresses, the 6rd BR and CE
   MUST validate the embedded IPv4 source address of the encapsulated
   IPv6 packet with the IPv4 source address it is encapsulated by
   according to the configured parameters of the 6rd domain.  If the two
   source addresses do not match, the packet MUST be dropped and a
   counter incremented to indicate that a potential spoofing attack may
   be underway.  Additionally, a CE MUST allow forwarding of packets
   sourced by the configured BR IPv4 address.

   An SP network can migrate to IPv6 at its own pace with little or no
   effect on customers being provided IPv6 via 6rd.  When native IPv6
   connectivity is available, an administrator can choose to disable
   6rd.

   The SP can choose to provision a separate IPv6 address block for
   native service, or reuse the 6rd prefix block itself.  If the SP uses
   a separate address block, moving from 6rd to native IPv6 is seen as a
   normal IPv6 renumbering event for the customer.  Renumbering may also
   be avoided by injecting the 6rd delegated prefix into the SP's IPv6
   routing domain.  Further considerations with regards to transitioning
   from 6rd to native IPv6 are not covered in this protocol
   specification.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.%20%20IPv6%20Address%20Space%20Usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11" name="section-11">11</a>.  IPv6 Address Space Usage</span>

   As 6rd uses service-provider address space, 6rd uses the normal
   address delegation a service provider gets from its Regional Internet
   Registry (RIR) and no global allocation of a single 6rd IANA-assigned
   address block like the 6to4 2002::/16 is needed.

   The service provider's prefix must be short enough to encode the
   unique bits of all IPv4 addresses within a given 6rd domain and still
   provide enough IPv6 address space to the residential site.  Assuming
   a worst case scenario using the full 32 bits for the IPv4 address,
   assigning a /56 for customer sites would mean that each service
   provider using 6rd would require a /24 for 6rd in addition to other
   IPv6 addressing needs.  Assuming that 6rd would be stunningly
   successful and taken up by almost all Autonomous System (AS) number
   holders (32K today), then the total address usage of 6rd would be
   equivalent to a /9.  If the SP instead delegated /60s to sites, the
   service provider would require a /28, and the total global address
   consumption by 6rd would be equivalent to a /13.  Again, this assumes
   that 6rd is used by all AS number holders in the IPv4 Internet today
   at the same time, that none have used any of 6rd's address
   compression techniques, and that none have moved to native IPv6 and
   reclaimed the 6rd space that was being used for other purposes.

   To alleviate concerns about address usage, 6rd allows for leaving out
   redundant IPv4 prefix bits in the encoding of the IPv4 address inside
   the 6rd IPv6 address.  This is most useful where the IPv4 address
   space is very well aggregated.  For example, to provide each customer



<span class="grey">Townsley &amp; Troan             Standards Track                   [Page 14]</span></pre>

   with a /60, if a service provider has all its IPv4 customers under a
   /12 then only 20 bits needs to be used to encode the IPv4 address and
   the service provider would only need a /40 IPv6 allocation for 6rd.
   If private address space is used, then a 10/8 would require a /36.
   If multiple 10/8 domains are used, then up to 16 could be supported
   within a /32.

   If a service provider has a non-aggregatable IPv4 space and requiring
   the use of the full 32-bit IPv4 address in the encoding of the 6rd
   IPv6 address, the 6rd prefix MUST be no longer than /32 in order to
   offer a 6rd delegated prefix of at least /64.

   The 6rd address block can be reclaimed when all users of it have
   transitioned to native IPv6 service.  This may require renumbering of
   customer sites and use of additional address space during the
   transition period.

   A 6to4 relay router as specified in [<a href="rfc3056.html" title='"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds"'>RFC3056</a>] can be used as an open
   relay.  It can be used to relay IPv6 traffic and as a traffic
   anonymizer.  By restricting the 6rd domain to within a provider
   network, a CE only needs to accept packets from a single or small set
   of known 6rd BR IPv4 addresses.  As such, many of the threats against
   6to4 as described in [<a href="rfc3964.html" title='"Security Considerations for 6to4"'>RFC3964</a>] do not apply.

   When applying the receiving rules in <a href="#section-9.2">Section 9.2</a>, IPv6 packets are as
   well protected against spoofing as IPv4 packets are within an SP
   network.

   A malicious user that is aware of a 6rd domain and the BR IPv4
   address could use this information to construct a packet that would
   cause a Border Relay to reflect tunneled packets outside of the
   domain that it is serving.  If the attacker constructs the packet
   accordingly and can inject a packet with an IPv6 source address that
   looks as if it originates from within another 6rd domain, forwarding
   loops between 6rd domains may be created, allowing the malicious user
   to launch a packet amplification attack between 6rd domains
   [<a href="#ref-RoutingLoop" title='"Routing Loop Attacks using IPv6 Tunnels"'>RoutingLoop</a>].

   One possible mitigation for this is to simply not allow the BR IPv4
   address to be reachable from outside the SP's 6rd domain.  In this
   case, carefully constructed IPv6 packets still could be reflected off
   a single BR, but the looping condition will not occur.  Tunneled
   packets with the BR IPv4 address as the source address might also be
   filtered to prohibit 6rd tunnels from exiting the 6rd domain.

   To avoid forwarding loops via other internal relays, the BR should
