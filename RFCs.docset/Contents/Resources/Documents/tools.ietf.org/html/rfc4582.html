Abstract

   Floor control is a means to manage joint or exclusive access to
   shared resources in a (multiparty) conferencing environment.
   Thereby, floor control complements other functions -- such as
   conference and media session setup, conference policy manipulation,
   and media control -- that are realized by other protocols.

   This document specifies the Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP).
   BFCP is used between floor participants and floor control servers,
   and between floor chairs (i.e., moderators) and floor control
   servers.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Within a conference, some applications need to manage the access to a
   set of shared resources, such as the right to send media to a
   particular media session.  Floor control enables such applications to
   provide users with coordinated (shared or exclusive) access to these
   resources.

   The Requirements for Floor Control Protocol [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Requirements for Floor Control Protocols"'>9</a>] list a set of
   requirements that need to be met by floor control protocols.  The
   Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP), which is specified in this
   document, meets these requirements.

   In addition, BFCP has been designed so that it can be used in
   low-bandwidth environments.  The binary encoding used by BFCP
   achieves a small message size (when message signatures are not used)
   that keeps the time it takes to transmit delay-sensitive BFCP
   messages to a minimum.  Delay-sensitive BFCP messages include
   FloorRequest, FloorRelease, FloorRequestStatus, and ChairAction.  It
   is expected that future extensions to these messages will not
   increase the size of these messages in a significant way.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>
   defines the terminology used throughout this document, <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>
   discusses the scope of BFCP (i.e., which tasks fall within the scope
   of BFCP and which ones are performed using different mechanisms),
   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> provides a non-normative overview of BFCP operation, and
   subsequent sections provide the normative specification of BFCP.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a>, <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>1</a>] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

   Media Participant: An entity that has access to the media resources
   of a conference (e.g., it can receive a media stream).  In floor-
   controlled conferences, a given media participant is typically
   colocated with a floor participant, but it does not need to be.
   Third-party floor requests consist of having a floor participant
   request a floor for a media participant when they are not colocated.
   The protocol between a floor participant and a media participant
   (that are not colocated) is outside the scope of this document.

   Client: A floor participant or a floor chair that communicates with a
   floor control server using BFCP.

   Floor: A temporary permission to access or manipulate a specific
   shared resource or set of resources.

   Floor Chair: A logical entity that manages one floor (grants, denies,
   or revokes a floor).  An entity that assumes the logical role of a
   floor chair for a given transaction may assume a different role
   (e.g., floor participant) for a different transaction.  The roles of
   floor chair and floor participant are defined on a transaction-by-
   transaction basis.  BFCP transactions are defined in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.

   Floor Control: A mechanism that enables applications or users to gain
   safe and mutually exclusive or non-exclusive input access to the
   shared object or resource.

   Floor Control Server: A logical entity that maintains the state of
   the floor(s), including which floors exists, who the floor chairs
   are, who holds a floor, etc.  Requests to manipulate a floor are
   directed at the floor control server.  The floor control server of a
   conference may perform other logical roles (e.g., floor participant)
   in another conference.

   Floor Participant: A logical entity that requests floors, and
   possibly information about them, from a floor control server.  An
   entity that assumes the logical role of a floor participant for a
   given transaction may assume a different role (e.g., a floor chair)
   for a different transaction.  The roles of floor participant and
   floor chair are defined on a transaction-by-transaction basis.  BFCP
   transactions are defined in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.  In floor-controlled
   conferences, a given floor participant is typically colocated with a
   media participant, but it does not need to be.  Third-party floor
   requests consist of having a floor participant request a floor for a
   media participant when they are not colocated.

   Participant: An entity that acts as a floor participant, as a media
   participant, or as both.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Scope</span>

   As stated earlier, BFCP is a protocol to coordinate access to shared
   resources in a conference following the requirements defined in [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Requirements for Floor Control Protocols"'>9</a>].
   Floor control complements other functions defined in the XCON
   conferencing framework [<a href="#ref-10" title='"A Framework and Data Model for Centralized Conferencing"'>10</a>].  The floor control protocol BFCP defined
   in this document only specifies a means to arbitrate access to
   floors.  The rules and constraints for floor arbitration and the
   results of floor assignments are outside the scope of this document
   and are defined by other protocols [<a href="#ref-10" title='"A Framework and Data Model for Centralized Conferencing"'>10</a>].

                 Figure 1: Functionality provided by BFCP

   BFCP provides a means:

   o  for floor participants to send floor requests to floor control
      servers.

   o  for floor control servers to grant or deny requests to access a
      given resource from floor participants.

   o  for floor chairs to send floor control servers decisions regarding
      floor requests.

   o  for floor control servers to keep floor participants and floor
      chairs informed about the status of a given floor or a given floor
      request.

   Even though tasks that do not belong to the previous list are outside
   the scope of BFCP, some of these out-of-scope tasks relate to floor
   control and are essential for creating floors and establishing BFCP
   connections between different entities.  In the following
   subsections, we discuss some of these tasks and mechanisms to perform
   them.

   The association of a given floor with a resource or a set of
   resources (e.g., media streams) is out of the scope of BFCP as
   described in [<a href="#ref-10" title='"A Framework and Data Model for Centralized Conferencing"'>10</a>].  Floor creation and termination are also outside
   the scope of BFCP; these aspects are handled using the conference
   control protocol for manipulating the conference object.
   Consequently, the floor control server needs to stay up to date on
   changes to the conference object (e.g., when a new floor is created).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Obtaining%20Information%20to%20Contact%20a%20Floor%20Control%20Server"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Obtaining Information to Contact a Floor Control Server</span>

   A client needs a set of data in order to establish a BFCP connection
   to a floor control server.  These data include the transport address
   of the server, the conference identifier, and a user identifier.

   Clients can obtain this information in different ways.  One is to use
   an SDP offer/answer [<a href="#ref-8" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>8</a>] exchange, which is described in [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) Streams"'>7</a>].  Other
   mechanisms are described in the XCON framework [<a href="#ref-10" title='"A Framework and Data Model for Centralized Conferencing"'>10</a>] (and other
   related documents).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20Obtaining%20Floor-Resource%20Associations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Obtaining Floor-Resource Associations</span>

   Floors are associated with resources.  For example, a floor that
   controls who talks at a given time has a particular audio session as
   its associated resource.  Associations between floors and resources
   are part of the conference object.

   Floor participants and floor chairs need to know which resources are
   associated with which floors.  They can obtain this information by
   using different mechanisms, such as an SDP offer/answer [<a href="#ref-8" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>8</a>] exchange.
   How to use an SDP offer/answer exchange to obtain these associations
   is described in [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) Streams"'>7</a>].

      Note that floor participants perform SDP offer/answer exchanges
      with the conference focus of the conference.  So, the conference
      focus needs to obtain information about associations between
      floors and resources in order to be able to provide this
      information to a floor participant in an SDP offer/answer
      exchange.

   Other mechanisms for obtaining this information, including discussion
   of how the information is made available to a (SIP) Focus, are
   described in the XCON framework [<a href="#ref-10" title='"A Framework and Data Model for Centralized Conferencing"'>10</a>] (and other related documents).

   A participant whose floor request is granted has the right to use (in
   a certain way) the resource or resources associated with the floor
   that was requested.  For example, the participant may have the right
   to send media over a particular audio stream.

   Nevertheless, holding a floor does not imply that others will not be
   able to use its associated resources at the same time, even if they
   do not have the right to do so.  Determination of which media
   participants can actually use the resources in the conference is
   discussed in the XCON Framework [<a href="#ref-10" title='"A Framework and Data Model for Centralized Conferencing"'>10</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Overview%20of%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Overview of Operation</span>

   This section provides a non-normative description of BFCP operations.
   <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a> describes the interface between floor participants and
   floor control servers, and <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> describes the interface
   between floor chairs and floor control servers.

   BFCP messages, which use a TLV (Type-Length-Value) binary encoding,
   consist of a common header followed by a set of attributes.  The
   common header contains, among other information, a 32-bit conference
   identifier.  Floor participants, media participants, and floor chairs
   are identified by 16-bit user identifiers.

   BFCP supports nested attributes (i.e., attributes that contain
   attributes).  These are referred to as grouped attributes.

   There are two types of transactions in BFCP: client-initiated
   transactions and server-initiated transactions.  Client-initiated
   transactions consist of a message from a client to the floor control
   server and a response from the floor control server to the client.
   Both messages can be related because they carry the same Transaction
   ID value in their common headers.  Server-initiated transactions
   consist of a single message, whose Transaction ID is 0, from the
   floor control server to a client.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Floor%20Participant%20to%20Floor%20Control%20Server%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Floor Participant to Floor Control Server Interface</span>

   Floor participants request a floor by sending a FloorRequest message
   to the floor control server.  BFCP supports third-party floor
   requests.  That is, the floor participant sending the floor request
   need not be colocated with the media participant that will get the
   floor once the floor request is granted.  FloorRequest messages carry
   the identity of the requester in the User ID field of the common
   header, and the identity of the beneficiary of the floor (in third-
   party floor requests) in a BENEFICIARY-ID attribute.



<span class="grey">Camarillo, et al.           Standards Track                     [Page 8]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-9" id="page-9" name="page-9"> </a>

      Third-party floor requests can be sent, for example, by floor
      participants that have a BFCP connection to the floor control
      server but that are not media participants (i.e., they do not
      handle any media).

   FloorRequest messages identify the floor or floors being requested by
   carrying their 16-bit floor identifiers in FLOOR-ID attributes.  If a
   FloorRequest message carries more than one floor identifier, the
   floor control server treats all the floor requests as an atomic
   package.  That is, the floor control server either grants or denies
   all the floors in the FloorRequest message.

   Floor control servers respond to FloorRequest messages with
   FloorRequestStatus messages, which provide information about the
   status of the floor request.  The first FloorRequestStatus message is
   the response to the FloorRequest message from the client, and
   therefore has the same Transaction ID as the FloorRequest.

   Additionally, the first FloorRequestStatus message carries the Floor
   Request ID in a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute.  Subsequent
   FloorRequestStatus messages related to the same floor request will
   carry the same Floor Request ID.  This way, the floor participant can
   associate them with the appropriate floor request.

   Messages from the floor participant related to a particular floor
   request also use the same Floor Request ID as the first
   FloorRequestStatus Message from the floor control server.

   Figure 2 shows how a floor participant requests a floor, obtains it,
   and, at a later time, releases it.  This figure illustrates the use,
   among other things, of the Transaction ID and the FLOOR-REQUEST-ID
   attribute.

                Figure 2: Requesting and releasing a floor

   Figure 3 shows how a floor participant requests to be informed on the
   status of a floor.  The first FloorStatus message from the floor
   control server is the response to the FloorQuery message and, as
   such, has the same Transaction ID as the FloorQuery message.

   Subsequent FloorStatus messages consist of server-initiated
   transactions, and therefore their Transaction ID is 0.  FloorStatus
   message (2) indicates that there are currently two floor requests for
   the floor whose Floor ID is 543.  FloorStatus message (3) indicates
   that the floor requests with Floor Request ID 764 has been granted,
   and the floor request with Floor Request ID 635 is the first in the
   queue.  FloorStatus message (4) indicates that the floor request with
   Floor Request ID 635 has been granted.

           Figure 3: Obtaining status information about a floor

   FloorStatus messages contain information about the floor requests
   they carry.  For example, FloorStatus message (4) indicates that the
   floor request with Floor Request ID 635 has as the beneficiary (i.e.,
   the participant that holds the floor when a particular floor request
   is granted) the participant whose User ID is 154.  The floor request
   applies only to the floor whose Floor ID is 543.  That is, this is
   not a multi-floor floor request.

      A multi-floor floor request applies to more than one floor (e.g.,
      a participant wants to be able to speak and write on the
      whiteboard at the same time).  The floor control server treats a
      multi-floor floor request as an atomic package.  That is, the
      floor control server either grants the request for all floors or
      denies the request for all floors.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Floor%20Chair%20to%20Floor%20Control%20Server%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Floor Chair to Floor Control Server Interface</span>

   Figure 4 shows a floor chair instructing a floor control server to
   grant a floor.

      Note, however, that although the floor control server needs to
      take into consideration the instructions received in ChairAction
      messages (e.g., granting a floor), it does not necessarily need to
      perform them exactly as requested by the floor chair.  The
      operation that the floor control server performs depends on the
      ChairAction message and on the internal state of the floor control
      server.

   For example, a floor chair may send a ChairAction message granting a
   floor that was requested as part of an atomic floor request operation
   that involved several floors.  Even if the chair responsible for one
   of the floors instructs the floor control server to grant the floor,
   the floor control server will not grant it until the chairs
   responsible for the other floors agree to grant them as well.  In
   another example, a floor chair may instruct the floor control server
   to grant a floor to a participant.  The floor control server needs to
   revoke the floor from its current holder before granting it to the

   So, the floor control server is ultimately responsible for keeping a

   Payload Length: This 16-bit field contains the length of the message
   in 4-octet units, excluding the common header.

   Conference ID: This 32-bit field identifies the conference the
   message belongs to.

   Transaction ID: This field contains a 16-bit value that allows users
   to match a given message with its response.  The value of the
   Transaction ID in server-initiated transactions is 0 (see <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>).

   User ID: This field contains a 16-bit value that uniquely identifies
   a participant within a conference.

      The identity used by a participant in BFCP, which is carried in
      the User ID field, is generally mapped to the identity used by the
      same participant in the session establishment protocol (e.g., in
      SIP).  The way this mapping is performed is outside the scope of
      this specification.

   attribute, identified by its type, has a particular format.  The
   attribute formats defined are:

      Unsigned16: The contents of the attribute consist of a 16-bit
      unsigned integer.

      OctetString16: The contents of the attribute consist of 16 bits of
      arbitrary data.

   M: The 'M' bit, known as the Mandatory bit, indicates whether support
   of the attribute is required.  If an unrecognized attribute with the
   'M' bit set is received, the message is rejected.  The 'M' bit is
   significant for extension attributes defined in other documents only.
   All attributes specified in this document MUST be understood by the
   receiver so that the setting of the 'M' bit is irrelevant for these.
   In all other cases, the unrecognised attribute is ignored but the
   message is processed.

   Length: This 8-bit field contains the length of the attribute in
   octets, excluding any padding defined for specific attributes.  The
   length of attributes that are not grouped includes the Type, 'M' bit,

                      Table 4: Request Status values

   Queue Position: This 8-bit field contains, when applicable, the
   position of the floor request in the floor request queue at the
   server.  If the Request Status value is different from Accepted, if
   the floor control server does not implement a floor request queue, or
   if the floor control server does not want to provide the client with
   this information, all the bits of this field SHOULD be set to zero.

   A floor request is in Pending state if the floor control server needs
   to contact a floor chair in order to accept the floor request, but
   has not done it yet.  Once the floor control chair accepts the floor
   request, the floor request is moved to the Accepted state.

   Primitive: These fields contain the types of the BFCP messages that
   are supported by the floor control server.  See Table 1 for the list
   of BFCP primitives.

   Padding: One, two, or three octets of padding added so that the
   contents of the SUPPORTED-PRIMITIVES attribute is 32-bit aligned.  If
   the attribute is already 32-bit aligned, no padding is needed.

   The Padding bits SHOULD be set to zero by the sender and MUST be
   ignored by the receiver.

   BFCP entities exchange BFCP messages using TCP connections.  TCP
   provides an in-order reliable delivery of a stream of bytes.
   Consequently, message framing is implemented in the application
   layer.  BFCP implements application-layer framing using TLV-encoded
   attributes.

   A client MUST NOT use more than one TCP connection to communicate
   with a given floor control server within a conference.  Nevertheless,
   if the same physical box handles different clients (e.g., a floor
   chair and a floor participant), which are identified by different
   User IDs, a separate connection per client is allowed.

   If a BFCP entity (a client or a floor control server) receives data
   from TCP that cannot be parsed, the entity MUST close the TCP
   connection, and the connection SHOULD be reestablished.  Similarly,
   if a TCP connection cannot deliver a BFCP message and times out, the
   TCP connection SHOULD be reestablished.






<span class="grey">Camarillo, et al.           Standards Track                    [Page 34]</span></pre>

   The way connection reestablishment is handled depends on how the
   client obtains information to contact the floor control server (e.g.,
   using an SDP offer/answer exchange [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) Streams"'>7</a>]).  Once the TCP connection is
   reestablished, the client MAY resend those messages for which it did
   not get a response from the floor control server.

   If a floor control server detects that the TCP connection towards one
   of the floor participants is lost, it is up to the local policy of
   the floor control server what to do with the pending floor requests
   of the floor participant.  In any case, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   floor control server keep the floor requests (i.e., that it does not
   cancel them) while the TCP connection is reestablished.

   If a client wishes to end its BFCP connection with a floor control
   server, the client closes (i.e., a graceful close) the TCP connection
   towards the floor control server.  If a floor control server wishes
   to end its BFCP connection with a client (e.g., the Focus of the
   conference informs the floor control server that the client has been
   kicked out from the conference), the floor control server closes
   (i.e., a graceful close) the TCP connection towards the client.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20Lower-Layer%20Security"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  Lower-Layer Security</span>

   BFCP relies on lower-layer security mechanisms to provide replay and
   integrity protection and confidentiality.  BFCP floor control servers
   and clients (which include both floor participants and floor chairs)
   MUST support TLS [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.1"'>3</a>].  Any BFCP entity MAY support other security
   mechanisms.

   BFCP entities MUST support, at a minimum, the TLS
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA ciphersuite [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>5</a>].

   Which party, the client or the floor control server, acts as the TLS
   server depends on how the underlying TCP connection is established.
   For example, when the TCP connection is established using an SDP
   offer/answer exchange [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) Streams"'>7</a>], the answerer (which may be the client or
   the floor control server) always acts as the TLS server.

   In BFCP, there are two types of transactions: client-initiated
   transactions and server-initiated transactions (notifications).
   Client-initiated transactions consist of a request from a client to a
   floor control server and a response from the floor control server to
   the client.  The request carries a Transaction ID in its common
   header, which the floor control server copies into the response.
   Clients use Transaction ID values to match responses with previously
   issued requests.

   Server-initiated transactions consist of a single message from a
   floor control server to a client.  Since they do not trigger any
   response, their Transaction ID is set to 0.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1.%20%20Client%20Behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" name="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Client Behavior</span>

   A client starting a client-initiated transaction MUST set the
   Conference ID in the common header of the message to the Conference
   ID for the conference that the client obtained previously.

   The client MUST set the Transaction ID value in the common header to
   a number that is different from 0 and that MUST NOT be reused in
   another message from the client until a response from the server is
   received for the transaction.  The client uses the Transaction ID
   value to match this message with the response from the floor control
   server.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.2.%20%20Server%20Behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" name="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Server Behavior</span>

   A floor control server sending a response within a client-initiated
   transaction MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction ID, and the
   User ID from the request received from the client into the response.
   Server-initiated transactions MUST contain a Transaction ID equal to
   0.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20%20Authentication%20and%20Authorization"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>.  Authentication and Authorization</span>

   BFCP clients SHOULD authenticate the floor control server before
   sending any BFCP message to it or accepting any BFCP message from it.
   Similarly, floor control servers SHOULD authenticate a client before
   accepting any BFCP message from it or sending any BFCP message to it.

   BFCP supports TLS-based mutual authentication between clients and
   floor control servers, as specified in <a href="#section-9.1">Section 9.1</a>.  This is the
   RECOMMENDED authentication mechanism in BFCP.

      Note that future extensions may define additional authentication
      mechanisms.

   In addition to authenticating BFCP messages, floor control servers
   need to authorize them.  On receiving an authenticated BFCP message,
   the floor control server checks whether the client sending the
   message is authorized.  If the client is not authorized to perform
   the operation being requested, the floor control server generates an
   Error message, as described in <a href="#section-13.8">Section 13.8</a>, with an Error code with
   a value of 5 (Unauthorized Operation).  Messages from a client that
   cannot be authorized MUST NOT be processed further.

   BFCP supports TLS-based mutual authentication between clients and
   floor control servers.  BFCP assumes that there is an integrity-
   protected channel between the client and the floor control server
   that can be used to exchange their self-signed certificates or, more
   commonly, the fingerprints of these certificates.  These certificates
   are used at TLS establishment time.

      The implementation of such an integrity-protected channel using
      SIP and the SDP offer/answer model is described in [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Format for Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP) Streams"'>7</a>].

   BFCP messages received over an authenticated TLS connection are
   considered authenticated.  A floor control server that receives a
   BFCP message over TCP (no TLS) can request the use of TLS by
   generating an Error message, as described in <a href="#section-13.8">Section 13.8</a>, with an
   Error code with a value of 9 (Use TLS).  Clients SHOULD simply ignore
   unauthenticated messages.

      Note that future extensions may define additional authentication
      mechanisms that may not require an initial integrity-protected
      channel (e.g., authentication based on certificates signed by a
      certificate authority).

   As described in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>, floor control servers need to perform
   authorization before processing any message.  In particular, the
   floor control server SHOULD check that messages arriving over a given
   authenticated TLS connection use an authorized User ID (i.e., a User
   ID that the user that established the authenticated TLS connection is
   allowed to use).

   The ABNF in <a href="#section-5.3.1">Section 5.3.1</a> describes the attributes that a
   FloorRequest message can contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies
   normatively which of these attributes are mandatory, and which ones
   are optional.

   The floor participant sets the Conference ID and the Transaction ID
   in the common header following the rules given in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.

   The floor participant sets the User ID in the common header to the
   floor participant's identifier.  This User ID will be used by the
   floor control server to authenticate and authorize the request.  If
   the sender of the FloorRequest message (identified by the User ID) is
   not the participant that would eventually get the floor (i.e., a
   third-party floor request), the sender SHOULD add a BENEFICIARY-ID
   attribute to the message identifying the beneficiary of the floor.

      Note that the name space for both the User ID and the Beneficiary
      ID is the same.  That is, a given participant is identified by a
      single 16-bit value that can be used in the User ID in the common
      header and in several attributes: BENEFICIARY-ID, BENEFICIARY-
      INFORMATION, and REQUESTED-BY-INFORMATION.

   The floor participant must insert at least one FLOOR-ID attribute in
   the FloorRequest message.  If the client inserts more than one
   FLOOR-ID attribute, the floor control server will treat all the floor
   requests as an atomic package.  That is, the floor control server
   will either grant or deny all the floors in the FloorRequest message.

   The floor participant may use a PARTICIPANT-PROVIDED-INFO attribute
   to state the reason why the floor or floors are being requested.  The
   Text field in the PARTICIPANT-PROVIDED-INFO attribute is intended for
   human consumption.

   The floor participant may request that the server handle the floor
   request with a certain priority using a PRIORITY attribute.

   A message from the floor control server is considered a response to
   the FloorRequest message if the message from the floor control server
   has the same Conference ID, Transaction ID, and User ID as the
   FloorRequest message, as described in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.  On receiving such
   a response, the floor participant follows the rules in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> that
   relate to floor control server authentication.

   The successful processing of a FloorRequest message at the floor
   control server involves generating one or several FloorRequestStatus
   messages.  The floor participant obtains a Floor Request ID in the
   Floor Request ID field of a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute in
   the first FloorRequestStatus message from the floor control server.
   Subsequent FloorRequestStatus messages from the floor control server
   regarding the same floor request will carry the same Floor Request ID
   in a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute as the initial
   FloorRequestStatus message.  This way, the floor participant can
   associate subsequent incoming FloorRequestStatus messages with the
   ongoing floor request.

   The floor participant obtains information about the status of the
   floor request in the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute of each of
   the FloorRequestStatus messages received from the floor control
   server.  This attribute is a grouped attribute, and as such it
   includes a number of attributes that provide information about the
   floor request.

   The OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute provides information about the
   overall status of the floor request.  If the Request Status value is
   Granted, all the floors that were requested in the FloorRequest
   message have been granted.  If the Request Status value is Denied,
   all the floors that were requested in the FloorRequest message have
   been denied.  A floor request is considered to be ongoing while it is
   in the Pending, Accepted, or Granted states.  If the floor request
   value is unknown, then the response is still processed.  However, no
   meaningful value can be reported to the user.

   The STATUS-INFO attribute, if present, provides extra information
   that the floor participant MAY display to the user.

   The FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes provide information about the
   status of the floor request as it relates to a particular floor.  The
   STATUS-INFO attribute, if present, provides extra information that
   the floor participant MAY display to the user.

   The BENEFICIARY-INFORMATION attribute identifies the beneficiary of
   the floor request in third-party floor requests.  The
   REQUESTED-BY-INFORMATION attribute need not be present in
   FloorRequestStatus messages received by the floor participant that
   requested the floor, as this floor participant is already identified
   by the User ID in the common header.

   The PRIORITY attribute, when present, contains the priority that was
   requested by the generator of the FloorRequest message.

   A floor participant that wishes to cancel an ongoing floor request
   does so by sending a FloorRelease message to the floor control
   server.  The FloorRelease message is also used by floor participants
   that hold a floor and would like to release it.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.2.1.%20%20Sending%20a%20FloorRelease%20Message"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10.2.1" name="section-10.2.1">10.2.1</a>.  Sending a FloorRelease Message</span>

   The ABNF in <a href="#section-5.3.2">Section 5.3.2</a> describes the attributes that a
   FloorRelease message can contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies
   normatively which of these attributes are mandatory, and which ones
   are optional.

   The floor participant sets the Conference ID and the Transaction ID
   in the common header following the rules given in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.  The
   floor participant sets the User ID in the common header to the floor
   participant's identifier.  This User ID will be used by the floor
   control server to authenticate and authorize the request.

      Note that the FloorRelease message is used to release a floor or
      floors that were granted and to cancel ongoing floor requests
      (from the protocol perspective, both are ongoing floor requests).
      Using the same message in both situations helps resolve the race
      condition that occurs when the FloorRelease message and the
      FloorGrant message cross each other on the wire.

   The floor participant uses the FLOOR-REQUEST-ID that was received in
   the response to the FloorRequest message that the FloorRelease
   message is cancelling.

      Note that if the floor participant requested several floors as an
      atomic operation (i.e., in a single FloorRequest message), all the
      floors are released as an atomic operation as well (i.e., all are
      released at the same time).

   A message from the floor control server is considered a response to
   the FloorRelease message if the message from the floor control server
   has the same Conference ID, Transaction ID, and User ID as the
   FloorRequest message, as described in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.  On receiving such
   a response, the floor participant follows the rules in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> that
   relate to floor control server authentication.

   If the response is a FloorRequestStatus message, the Request Status
   value in the OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute (within the FLOOR-
   REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute) will be Cancelled or Released.

   If the response is an Error message, the floor control server could
   not process the FloorRequest message for some reason, which is
   described in the Error message.

   It is possible that the FloorRelease message crosses on the wire with
   a FloorRequestStatus message from the server with a Request Status
   different from Cancelled or Released.  In any case, such a
   FloorRequestStatus message will not be a response to the FloorRelease
   message, as its Transaction ID will not match that of the
   FloorRelease.

   This section specifies how floor chairs can instruct the floor
   control server to grant or revoke a floor using the protocol elements
   described in earlier sections.

   Floor chairs that wish to send instructions to a floor control server
   do so by sending a ChairAction message.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.1.%20%20Sending%20a%20ChairAction%20Message"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.1" name="section-11.1">11.1</a>.  Sending a ChairAction Message</span>

   The ABNF in <a href="#section-5.3.9">Section 5.3.9</a> describes the attributes that a ChairAction
   message can contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies normatively
   which of these attributes are mandatory, and which ones are optional.

   The floor chair sets the Conference ID and the Transaction ID in the
   common header following the rules given in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.  The floor
   chair sets the User ID in the common header to the floor
   participant's identifier.  This User ID will be used by the floor
   control server to authenticate and authorize the request.

   The ChairAction message contains instructions that apply to one or
   more floors within a particular floor request.  The floor or floors
   are identified by the FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes and the floor
   request is identified by the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION-HEADER, which
   are carried in the ChairAction message.

   For example, if a floor request consists of two floors that depend on
   different floor chairs, each floor chair will grant its floor within
   the floor request.  Once both chairs have granted their floor, the
   floor control server will grant the floor request as a whole.  On the
   other hand, if one of the floor chairs denies its floor, the floor

   control server will deny the floor request as a whole, regardless of
   the other floor chair's decision.

   The floor chair provides the new status of the floor request as it
   relates to a particular floor using a FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attribute.
   If the new status of the floor request is Accepted, the floor chair
   MAY use the Queue Position field to provide a queue position for the
   floor request.  If the floor chair does not wish to provide a queue
   position, all the bits of the Queue Position field SHOULD be set to
   zero.  The floor chair SHOULD use the Status Revoked to revoke a
   floor that was granted (i.e., Granted status) and SHOULD use the
   Status Denied to reject floor requests in any other status (e.g.,
   Pending and Accepted).

   The floor chair MAY add an OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute to the
   ChairAction message to provide a new overall status for the floor
   request.  If the new overall status of the floor request is Accepted,
   the floor chair MAY use the Queue Position field to provide a queue
   position for the floor request.

      Note that a particular floor control server may implement a
      different queue for each floor containing all the floor requests
      that relate to that particular floor, a general queue for all
      floor requests, or both.  Also note that a floor request may
      involve several floors and that a ChairAction message may only
      deal with a subset of these floors (e.g., if a single floor chair
      is not authorized to manage all the floors).  In this case, the
      floor control server will combine the instructions received from
      the different floor chairs in FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS attributes to
      come up with the overall status of the floor request.

      Note that, while the action of a floor chair may communicate
      information in the OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute, the floor
      control server may override, modify, or ignore this field's
      content.

   The floor chair may use STATUS-INFO attributes to state the reason
   why the floor or floors are being accepted, granted, or revoked.  The
   Text in the STATUS-INFO attribute is intended for human consumption.

   A ChairActionAck message from the floor control server confirms that

   A client can obtain information about the status of a floor or floors
   in different ways, which include using BFCP and using out-of-band
   mechanisms.  Clients using BFCP to obtain such information use the
   procedures described in this section.

   Clients request information about the status of one or several floors
   by sending a FloorQuery message to the floor control server.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.1.1.%20%20Sending%20a%20FloorQuery%20Message"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.1.1" name="section-12.1.1">12.1.1</a>.  Sending a FloorQuery Message</span>

   message can contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies normatively
   which of these attributes are mandatory, and which ones are optional.

   The client sets the Conference ID and the Transaction ID in the
   common header following the rules given in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.  The client
   sets the User ID in the common header to the client's identifier.
   This User ID will be used by the floor control server to authenticate
   and authorize the request.

   The client inserts in the message all the Floor IDs it wants to
   receive information about.  The floor control server will send
   periodic information about all of these floors.  If the client does
   not want to receive information about a particular floor any longer,
   it sends a new FloorQuery message removing the FLOOR-ID of this
   floor.  If the client does not want to receive information about any
   floor any longer, it sends a FloorQuery message with no FLOOR-ID
   attribute.

   FloorRequest message, as described in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.  On receiving such
   a response, the client follows the rules in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> that relate to
   floor control server authentication.

   On reception of the FloorQuery message, the floor control server will
   respond with a FloorStatus message or with an Error message.  If the
   response is a FloorStatus message, it will contain information about
   one of the floors the client requested information about.  If the
   client did not include any FLOOR-ID attribute in its FloorQuery
   message (i.e., the client does not want to receive information about
   any floor any longer), the FloorStatus message from the floor control
   server will not include any FLOOR-ID attribute either.

   FloorStatus messages that carry information about a floor contain a
   FLOOR-ID attribute that identifies the floor.  After this attribute,
   FloorStatus messages contain information about existing (one or more)
   floor requests that relate to that floor.  The information about each
   particular floor request is encoded in a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION
   attribute.  This grouped attribute carries a Floor Request ID that
   identifies the floor request, followed by a set of attributes that
   provide information about the floor request.

   After the first FloorStatus, the floor control server will continue
   sending FloorStatus messages, periodically informing the client about
   changes on the floors the client requested information about.

   A client can obtain information about the status of one or several
   floor requests in different ways, which include using BFCP and using
   out-of-band mechanisms.  Clients using BFCP to obtain such
   information use the procedures described in this section.

   Clients request information about the current status of a floor
   request by sending a FloorRequestQuery message to the floor control
   server.

   Requesting information about a particular floor request is useful in
   a number of situations.  For example, on reception of a FloorRequest
   message, a floor control server may choose to return
   FloorRequestStatus messages only when the floor request changes its
   state (e.g., from Accepted to Granted), but not when the floor
   request advances in its queue.  In this situation, if the user
   requests it, the floor participant can use a FloorRequestQuery
   message to poll the floor control server for the status of the floor
   request.

   On reception of a FloorRequest message, the floor control server
   follows the rules in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> that relate to client authentication
   and authorization.  If while processing the FloorRequest message, the
   floor control server encounters an error, it SHOULD generate an Error
   response following the procedures described in <a href="#section-13.8">Section 13.8</a>.

      BFCP allows floor participants to have several ongoing floor
      requests for the same floor (e.g., the same floor participant can
      occupy more than one position in a queue at the same time).  A
      floor control server that only supports a certain number of
      ongoing floor requests per floor participant (e.g., one) can use
      Error Code 8 (You have Already Reached the Maximum Number of
      Ongoing Floor Requests for this Floor) to inform the floor
      participant.

   The successful processing of a FloorRequest message by a floor
   control server involves generating one or several FloorRequestStatus
   messages, the first of which SHOULD be generated as soon as possible.
   If the floor control server cannot accept, grant, or deny the floor
   request right away (e.g., a decision from a chair is needed), it
   SHOULD use a Request Status value of Pending in the OVERALL-REQUEST-
   STATUS attribute (within the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped
   attribute) of the first FloorRequestStatus message it generates.

      The policy that a floor control server follows to grant or deny
      floors is outside the scope of this document.  A given floor
      control server may perform these decisions automatically while
      another may contact a human acting as a chair every time a
      decision needs to be made.

   FloorRequestStatus, as described in <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>.  Additionally, the
   floor control server MUST add a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped
   attribute to the FloorRequestStatus.  The attributes contained in
   this grouped attribute carry information about the floor request.

   The floor control server MUST assign an identifier that is unique
   within the conference to this floor request, and MUST insert it in
   the Floor Request ID field of the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION
   attribute.  This identifier will be used by the floor participant (or
   by a chair or chairs) to refer to this specific floor request in the
   future.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Floor IDs in the FLOOR-ID
   attributes of the FloorRequest into the FLOOR-REQUEST-STATUS
   attributes in the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.  These
   Floor IDs identify the floors being requested (i.e., the floors
   associated with this particular floor request).

   The floor control server SHOULD copy (if present) the contents of the
   BENEFICIARY-ID attribute from the FloorRequest into a
   BENEFICIARY-INFORMATION attribute inside the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.  Additionally, the floor
   control server MAY provide the display name and the URI of the
   beneficiary in this BENEFICIARY-INFORMATION attribute.

   The floor control server MAY provide information about the requester
   of the floor in a REQUESTED-BY-INFORMATION attribute inside the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.

   The floor control server MAY copy (if present) the PARTICIPANT-
   PROVIDED-INFO attribute from the FloorRequest into the FLOOR-
   REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.

      Note that this attribute carries the priority requested by the
      participant.  The priority that the floor control server assigns
      to the floor request depends on the priority requested by the
      participant and the rights the participant has according to the
      policy of the conference.  For example, a participant that is only
      allowed to use the Normal priority may request Highest priority
      for a floor request.  In that case, the floor control server would
      ignore the priority requested by the participant.

   The floor control server MAY copy (if present) the
   PARTICIPANT-PROVIDED-INFO attribute from the FloorRequest into the
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.

   A floor request is considered to be ongoing as long as it is not in
   the Cancelled, Released, or Revoked states.  If the OVERALL-REQUEST-
   STATUS attribute (inside the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped
   attribute) of the first FloorRequestStatus message generated by the
   floor control server did not indicate any of these states, the floor
   control server will need to send subsequent FloorRequestStatus
   messages.

   When the status of the floor request changes, the floor control
   server SHOULD send new FloorRequestStatus messages with the
   appropriate Request Status.  The floor control server MUST add a
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION attribute with a Floor Request ID equal to
   the one sent in the first FloorRequestStatus message to any new
   FloorRequestStatus related to the same floor request.  (The Floor
   Request ID identifies the floor request to which the
   FloorRequestStatus applies.)

   The floor control server MUST set the Transaction ID of subsequent
   FloorRequestStatus messages to 0.

      The rate at which the floor control server sends
      FloorRequestStatus messages is a matter of local policy.  A floor
      control server may choose to send a new FloorRequestStatus message
      every time the floor request moves in the floor request queue,
      while another may choose only to send a new FloorRequestStatus
      message when the floor request is Granted or Denied.

   The floor control server may add a STATUS-INFO attribute to any of
   the FloorRequestStatus messages it generates to provide extra
   information about its decisions regarding the floor request (e.g.,
   why it was denied).

      Floor participants and floor chairs may request to be informed
      about the status of a floor following the procedures in
      <a href="#section-12.1">Section 12.1</a>.  If the processing of a floor request changes the
      status of a floor (e.g., the floor request is granted and
      consequently the floor has a new holder), the floor control server
      needs to follow the procedures in <a href="#section-13.5">Section 13.5</a> to inform the
      clients that have requested that information.

   The common header and the rest of the attributes are the same as in
   the first FloorRequestStatus message.

   The floor control server can discard the state information about a
   particular floor request when this reaches a status of Cancelled,
   Released, or Revoked.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction
   ID, and the User ID from the UserQuery message into the USerStatus
   message, as described in <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>.

   The sender of the UserQuery message is requesting information about
   all the floor requests associated with a given participant (i.e., the

   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.

   The floor control server MUST add an OVERALL-REQUEST-STATUS attribute
   to the FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute.  The Request
   Status value SHOULD be Released, if the floor (or floors) had been
   previously granted, or Cancelled, if the floor (or floors) had not
   been previously granted.  The floor control server MAY add a STATUS-

   A floor control server receiving a FloorQuery message from a client
   SHOULD keep this client informed about the status of the floors
   identified by FLOOR-ID attributes in the FloorQuery message.  Floor
   Control Servers keep clients informed by using FloorStatus messages.

   An individual FloorStatus message carries information about a single
   floor.  So, when a FloorQuery message requests information about more
   than one floor, the floor control server needs to send separate
   FloorStatus messages for different floors.

   The information FloorQuery messages carry may depend on the user
   requesting the information.  For example, a chair may be able to
   receive information about pending requests, while a regular user may
   not be authorized to do so.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction
   ID, and the User ID from the FloorQuery message into the FloorStatus
   message, as described in <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>.

   If the FloorQuery message did not contain any FLOOR-ID attribute, the
   floor control server sends the FloorStatus message without adding any
   additional attribute and does not send any subsequent FloorStatus
   message to the floor participant.

   If the FloorQuery message contained one or more FLOOR-ID attributes,
   the floor control server chooses one from among them and adds this
   FLOOR-ID attribute to the FloorStatus message.  The floor control
   server SHOULD add a FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute for
   each floor request associated to the floor.  Each
   FLOOR-REQUEST-INFORMATION grouped attribute contains a number of
   attributes that provide information about the floor request.  For

   If the FloorQuery message carried more than one FLOOR-ID attribute,
   the floor control server SHOULD generate a FloorStatus message for

   are generated following the same rules as those for the first
   FloorStatus message (see <a href="#section-13.5.1">Section 13.5.1</a>), but their Transaction ID is
   0.

   After generating these messages, the floor control server sends
   FloorStatus messages, periodically keeping the client informed about
   all the floors for which the client requested information.  The
   Transaction ID of these messages MUST be 0.

      The rate at which the floor control server sends FloorStatus
      messages is a matter of local policy.  A floor control server may
      choose to send a new FloorStatus message every time a new floor
      request arrives, while another may choose to only send a new
      FloorStatus message when a new floor request is Granted.

   On reception of a ChairAction message, the floor control server
   follows the rules in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> that relate to client authentication
   and authorization.  If while processing the ChairAction message, the
   floor control server encounters an error, it SHOULD generate an Error
   response following the procedures described in <a href="#section-13.8">Section 13.8</a>.

   The successful processing of a ChairAction message by a floor control
   server involves generating a ChairActionAck message, which SHOULD be
   generated as soon as possible.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction
   ID, and the User ID from the ChairAction message into the
   ChairActionAck message, as described in <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>.

   The floor control server needs to take into consideration the
   operation requested in the ChairAction message (e.g., granting a
   floor) but does not necessarily need to perform it as requested by
   the floor chair.  The operation that the floor control server
   performs depends on the ChairAction message and on the internal state
   of the floor control server.

   For example, a floor chair may send a ChairAction message granting a
   floor that was requested as part of an atomic floor request operation
   that involved several floors.  Even if the chair responsible for one
   of the floors instructs the floor control server to grant the floor,
   the floor control server will not grant it until the chairs
   responsible for the other floors agree to grant them as well.

   So, the floor control server is ultimately responsible for keeping a
   coherent floor state using instructions from floor chairs as input to
   this state.

   If the new Status in the ChairAction message is Accepted and all the
   bits of the Queue Position field are zero, the floor chair is
   requesting that the floor control server assign a queue position
   (e.g., the last in the queue) to the floor request based on the local
   policy of the floor control server.  (Of course, such a request only
   applies if the floor control server implements a queue.)

   On reception of a Hello message, the floor control server follows the

   error, it SHOULD generate an Error response following the procedures

   the Conference ID, the Transaction ID, and the User ID from the Hello
   into the HelloAck, as described in <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>.

   The floor control server MUST add a SUPPORTED-PRIMITIVES attribute to
   the HelloAck message listing all the primitives (i.e., BFCP messages)
   supported by the floor control server.

   Error messages are always sent in response to a previous message from
   the client as part of a client-initiated transaction.  The ABNF in
   <a href="#section-5.3.13">Section 5.3.13</a> describes the attributes that an Error message can
   contain.  In addition, the ABNF specifies normatively which of these
   attributes are mandatory and which ones are optional.

   The floor control server MUST copy the Conference ID, the Transaction
   ID, and the User ID from the message from the client into the Error
   message, as described in <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>.

   The floor control server MUST add an ERROR-CODE attribute to the
   Error message.  The ERROR-CODE attribute contains an Error Code from
   Table 5.  Additionally, the floor control server may add an
   ERROR-INFO attribute with extra information about the error.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/14.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-14" name="section-14">14</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   BFCP uses TLS to provide mutual authentication between clients and
   servers.  TLS also provides replay and integrity protection and
   confidentiality.  It is RECOMMENDED that TLS with non-null encryption
   always be used.  BFCP entities MAY use other security mechanisms as
   long as they provide similar security properties.

   The remainder of this section analyzes some of the threats against
   BFCP and how they are addressed.

   An attacker may attempt to impersonate a client (a floor participant
   or a floor chair) in order to generate forged floor requests or to
   grant or deny existing floor requests.  Client impersonation is
   avoided by having servers only accept BFCP messages over
   authenticated TLS connections.  The floor control server assumes that
   attackers cannot highjack the TLS connection and, therefore, that
   messages over the TLS connection come from the client that was
   initially authenticated.

   An attacker may attempt to impersonate a floor control server.  A
   successful attacker would be able to make clients think that they
   hold a particular floor so that they would try to access a resource
   (e.g., sending media) without having legitimate rights to access it.
   Floor control server impersonation is avoided by having servers only
   accept BFCP messages over authenticated TLS connections.

   Attackers may attempt to modify messages exchanged by a client and a
   floor control server.  The integrity protection provided by TLS
   connections prevents this attack.

   An attacker may attempt to fetch a valid message sent by a client to
   a floor control server and replay it over a connection between the
   attacker and the floor control server.  This attack is prevented by
   having floor control servers check that messages arriving over a
   given authenticated TLS connection use an authorized user ID (i.e., a
   user ID that the user that established the authenticated TLS
   connection is allowed to use).

   Attackers may attempt to pick messages from the network to get access
   to confidential information between the floor control server and a
   client (e.g., why a floor request was denied).  TLS confidentiality
   prevents this attack.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that TLS be used
   with a non-null encryption algorithm.
