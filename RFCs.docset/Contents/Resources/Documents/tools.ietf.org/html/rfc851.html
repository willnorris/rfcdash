     This RFC specifies the ARPANET 1822L Host Access Protocol,  which
     
     will allow hosts to use logical addressing (i.e., host names that
     
     are independent of their physical location  on  the  ARPANET)  to
     
     communicate  with  each  other.  This new host access protocol is
     
     known as the ARPANET 1822L (for Logical)  Host  Access  Protocol,
     
     and  is  a  successor  to  the  current  ARPANET 1822 Host Access
     
     Protocol, which is described in  sections  3.3  and  3.4  of  BBN
     
     Report  1822  [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>].   Although  the  1822L protocol uses different
     
     Host-IMP leaders than the 1822 protocol, the IMPs  will  continue
     
     to support the 1822 protocol, and hosts using either protocol can
     
     readily communicate with each other (the  IMPs  will  handle  the
     
     translation automatically).
     
     
     There is one major restriction to the  new  1822L  protocol:   it
     
     will be implemented in C/30 IMPs only, and will therefore only be
     
     usable by hosts connected to C/30 IMPs, as Honeywell and Pluribus
     
     IMPs  do  not have sufficient memory to hold the new programs and
     
     tables.  This restriction  also  means  that  logical  addressing
     
     cannot  be used to identify a host on a non-C/30 IMP.  While this
     
     is not a problem on the ARPANET, which only has  C/30  IMPs,  the
     
     restriction  will  apply  if  logical  addressing  is used on any
     
     network that mixes C/30 and non-C/30 IMPs.

     The RFC's terminology is consistent  with  that  used  in  Report
     
     1822, and any new terms will be defined when they are first used.
     
     Familiarity  with  Report  1822  (section  3  in  particular)  is
     
     assumed.   As could be expected, the RFC makes many references to
     
     Report 1822.  As a result, it uses, as a convenient abbreviation,
     
     "see 1822(x)" instead of "please refer to Report 1822, section x,
     
     for further details".

     o In <a href="#section-2.2">section 2.2</a>, descriptions of  the  three  address  selection
     
       policies and of host error handling have been added.
     
     
     o In <a href="#section-2.3">section 2.3</a>, the IMP's uncontrolled packet service has  been
     
       further  improved.  This applies to hosts using 1822 as well as
     
       1822L.

     The ARPANET 1822L Host Access  Protocol  allows  a  host  to  use
     
     logical  addressing  to  communicate  with  other  hosts  on  the
     
     ARPANET.  Basically, logical addressing allows hosts to refer  to
     
     each  other  using  an  1822L  name  (see  section  2.1) which is
     
     independent of a host's physical location in  the  network.   IEN

     logical  addressing  considerable   justification.    Among   the
     
     advantages it cites are:
     
     
     o The ability to refer to each host on  the  network  by  a  name
     
       independent of its location on the network.
     
     
     o Allowing different hosts to share  the  same  host  port  on  a
     
       time-division basis.
     
     
     o Allowing a host to use multi-homing (where a single  host  uses
     
       more than one port to communicate with the network).
     
     
     o Allowing several hosts that provide the same service  to  share
     
       the same name.
     
     
     The main differences between the 1822 and 1822L protocols are the
     
     format of the leaders that are used to introduce messages between
     
     a host and an IMP, and the specification in those leaders of  the
     
     source  and/or  destination  host(s).   Hosts  have the choice of

     using the 1822 or the 1822L protocol.  When a host comes up on an
     
     IMP,  it  declares  itself to be an 1822 host or an 1822L host by
     
     the type of NOP message (see section  3.1)  it  uses.   Once  up,
     
     hosts  can  switch  from  one protocol to the other by issuing an
     
     appropriate NOP.  Hosts that do not use the 1822L  protocol  will
     
     still  be  addressable by and can communicate with hosts that do,
     
     and vice-versa.
     
     
     Another difference between the two protocols  is  that  the  1822
     
     leaders are symmetric, while the 1822L leaders are not.  The term
     
     symmetric means that in the 1822 protocol, the exact same  leader
     
     format  is used for messages in both directions between the hosts
     
     and IMPs.  For example, a leader sent from a host  over  a  cable
     
     that  was  looped  back onto itself (via a looping plug or faulty
     
     hardware) would arrive back at the host and appear to be a  legal
     
     message  from  a  real host (the destination host of the original
     
     message).  In contrast, the 1822L headers are not symmetric,  and
     
     a  host  can  detect  if  the  connection to its IMP is looped by
     
     receiving a message with the wrong leader  format.   This  allows
     
     the host to take appropriate action upon detection of the loop.

     constraints mentioned in the introduction, hosts on non-C/30 IMPs
     
     cannot be assigned 1822L names.  To circumvent this  restriction,
     
     however,  1822L  hosts can also use 1822L addresses to access all
     
     of the other hosts.
     
     
     At this point, several questions  arise:   How  are  these  names
     
     assigned,  how  do  they  become  known  to  the  IMPs  (so  that
     
     translations to physical addresses can be made), and how  do  the
     
     IMPs know which host is currently using a shared port?  To answer
     
     each question in order:
     
     
     Names are assigned by a central network administrator.  When each
     
     name  is  created, it is assigned to a host (or a group of hosts)
     
     at one or more specific host ports.  The host(s) are  allowed  to
     
     reside at those specific host ports, and nowhere else.  If a host
     
     moves, it will keep the same name, but the administrator  has  to
     
     update  the  central  database  to  reflect  the  new  host port.
     
     Changes to this database are  distributed  to  the  IMPs  by  the
     
     Network  Operations  Center  (NOC).  For a while, the host may be
     
     allowed to reside at either of (or both) the new and  old  ports.
     
     Once  the  correspondence  between  a  name and one or more hosts
     
     ports where it  may  be  used  has  been  made  official  by  the
     
     administrator,   that  name  is  said  to  be  authorized.  1822L
     
     addresses, which actually  refer  to  physical  host  ports,  are
     
     always authorized in this sense.

     Once a host has been assigned one or more names, it  has  to  let
     
     the  IMPs  know  where it is and what name(s) it is using.  There
     
     are two cases to consider, one for 1822L hosts  and  another  for

     C/30 IMPs.
     
     
     When an IMP sees an 1822L host come up on a host  port,  the  IMP
     
     has  no way of knowing which host has just come up (several hosts
     
     may share the same port, or one host may prefer to  be  known  by
     
     different  names  at different times).  This requires the host to
     
     declare itself to the IMP before it can actually send and receive
     
     messages.   This  function  is  performed  by  a  new host-to-IMP
     
     message, the Name Declaration  Message  (NDM),  which  lists  the
     
     names  that  the  host would like to be known by.  The IMP checks
     
     its tables to see if each of the names is authorized,  and  sends
     
     an  NDM  Reply  to  the  host  saying  which  names were actually
     
     authorized and can now be used for sending and receiving messages
     
     (i.e.,  which  names  are  effective). A host can also use an NDM
     
     message to change its list of effective names (it can add to  and
     
     delete  from  the  list) at any time.  The only constraint on the

     finds in its tables for that host become effective.   Thus,  even
     
     though  the host is using the 1822 protocol, it can still receive
     
     messages from 1822L hosts via its 1822L name.  Of course, it  can
     
     also receive messages from an 1822L host via its 1822L address as
     
     well.   (Remember,  the  distinction  between  1822L  names   and
     
     addresses  is that the addresses correspond to physical locations
     
     on  the  network,  while   the   names   are   strictly   logical
     
     identifiers).   The  IMPs translate between the different leaders
     
     and send the proper leader in each case (see <a href="#section-2.2.4">section 2.2.4</a>).
     
     
     The third question above has by now already been answered.   When
     
     an  1822L  host comes up, it uses the NDM message to tell the IMP
     
     which host it is (which names it is known by).  Even if this is a
     
     shared port, the IMP knows which host is currently connected.
     
     
     Whenever a host goes down, its names  automatically  become  non-
     
     effective.   When it comes back up, it has to make them effective
     
     again.

     Several hosts can share the same 1822L name.  If more than one of
     
     these  hosts  is  up  at the same time, any messages sent to that
     
     1822L name will be delivered to just one  of  the  hosts  sharing
     
     that  name,  and  a RFNM will be returned as usual.  However, the

     sending host will  not  receive  any  indication  of  which  host
     
     received  the  message,  and subsequent messages to that name are
     
     not guaranteed to be sent to the  same  host.   Typically,  hosts
     
     providing  exactly  the  same  service could share the same 1822L
     
     name in this manner.
     
     
     Similarly, when a host is multi-homed, the same  1822L  name  may
     
     refer  to  more  than  one  host  port (all connected to the same
     
     host).  If the host is up on only one of those ports,  that  port
     
     will be used for all messages addressed to the host.  However, if
     
     the host were up on more than one  port,  the  message  would  be
     
     delivered  over  just  one  of  those ports, and the subnet would
     
     choose which port to use.  This port selection could change  from
     
     message  to  message.   If  a  host wanted to insure that certain
     
     messages were delivered to it on specific ports,  these  messages
     
     could  use  either  the  port's 1822L address or a specific 1822L
     
     name that referred to that port alone.
     
     
     Three different address selection policies are available for  the
     
     name mapping process.  When translated, each name uses one of the
     
     three policies  (the  policy  is  pre-determined  on  a  per-name
     
     basis).  The three policies are:
     
     
     o  Attempt each translation in the order in  which  the  physical
     
        addresses  are listed in the IMP's translation tables, to find

     o  Use load leveling. This is similar to the second  policy,  but
     
        differs  in  that  searching  the  address  list  for  a valid
     
        translation starts at the address following where the previous
     
        translation  search  ended.   This  attempts to spread out the
     
        load from any one  IMP's  hosts  to  the  various  host  ports
     
        associated  with  a  particular  name.   Note that this is NOT

     As was explained in report 1822, and  as  will  be  discussed  in
     
     greater detail in <a href="#section-2.5">section 2.5</a>, whenever regular messages are sent

     up.
     
     
     However, the destination host may go down for some reason  during

     that time, ONE of the following events will occur:
     
     A1.  If 1822 or an 1822L address is being  used  to  specify  the
     
          destination host, then the source host will receive a type 7
     
          (Destination Host Dead) message from the IMP.
     
     A2.  If an 1822L name is being used to  specify  the  destination
     
          host,  and  the  name maps to only one authorized host port,
     
          then a type 7 message will also be sent to the source host.
     
     A3.  If an 1822L name is being used to  specify  the  destination
     
          host,  and  the  name  maps to more than one authorized host
     
          port, then the IMP attempts to open a connection to  another
     
          authorized  and  effective  host  port for that name.  If no
     
          such connection can be made, the host will receive a type 15
     
          (1822L  Name  or  Address  Error),  subtype  5 (no effective
     
          translations) message (see <a href="#section-3.2">section 3.2</a>).  Note that a type 7
     
          message  cannot be returned to the source host, since type 7

     Things get a bit more complicated if there  are  any  outstanding
     
     messages  on  the connection when the destination host goes down.
     
     The connection will be closed, and  one  of  the  following  will
     
     occur:
     
     B1.  If 1822 or an 1822L address is being  used  to  specify  the
     
          destination host, then the source host will receive a type 7
     
          message for each outstanding message.
     
     B2.  If an 1822L name is being used to  specify  the  destination
     
          host, then the source host will receive a type 9 (Incomplete
     
          Transmission),  subtype  3  (message  lost  due  to  network
     
          failure)  message  for  each  outstanding message.  The next
     
          time the source host submits another message for  that  same
     
          destination  name,  the  previous  algorithm  will  be  used
     
          (either step A2 or step A3).
     
     
     The above two algorithms also apply when a  host  stays  up,  but
     
     declares  the  destination  name for an existing connection to no
     
     longer be effective.  In this case, however, the type 7  messages
     
     above will be replaced by type 15, subtype 3 (name not effective)

     intercommunicate,  and  the  IMPs  will  automatically handle any
     
     necessary leader and address format  conversions.   However,  not

     Uncontrolled packets (see 1822(3.6)) present a unique problem for
     
     the  1822L protocol.  Uncontrolled packets use none of the normal
     
     ordering and error-control mechanisms in the IMP, and do not  use
     
     the  normal  subnetwork  connection  facilities.   As  a  result,
     
     uncontrolled packets need to carry all  of  their  overhead  with
     
     them, including source and destination names.  If 1822L names are
     
     used when sending an uncontrolled packet, additional  information
     
     is  now required by the subnetwork when the packet is transferred
     
     to the destination IMP.  This means that less  host-to-host  data
     
     can  be  contained  in  the  packet than is possible between 1822
     
     hosts.
     
     
     Uncontrolled packets that are sent between 1822 hosts may contain
     
     not  more  than  991 bits of data.  Uncontrolled packets that are
     
     sent to and/or from 1822L hosts are limited to 32 bits  less,  or
     
     not  more  than  959  bits.  Packets that exceed this length will
     
     result in an error indication to the host, and  the  packet  will
     
     not  be sent.  This error indication represents an enhancement to
     
     the previous level of service provided by the  IMP,  which  would
     
     simply   discard  an  overly  long  uncontrolled  packet  without
     
     notification.

     Other enhancements that  are  provided  for  uncontrolled  packet
     
     service  are  a  notification  to the host of any errors that are
     
     detected by the host's IMP when it receives the packet.   A  host
     
     will  be  notified if an uncontrolled packet contains an error in
     
     the 1822L  name  specification,  such  as  if  the  name  is  not
     
     authorized or effective, if the remote host is unreachable (which
     
     is indicated by none of its names being  effective),  if  network
     
     congestion control throttled the packet before it left the source

     the packet on its way.

     packet  was  lost  once  it  was  transmitted  by the source IMP.
     
     However, the IMP will attempt to notify  the  source  host  if  a
     
     logically-addressed  uncontrolled packet was mistakenly sent to a
     
     host that the source IMP thought was effective, but which  turned
     
     out  to  be  dead  or non-effective at the destination IMP.  This
     
     non-delivery notice  is  sent  back  to  the  source  IMP  as  an
     
     uncontrolled  packet from the destination IMP, so the source host
     
     is not guaranteed to receive this indication.
     
     
     If the source IMP successfully receives the non-delivery  notice,
     
     then  the  source  host  will  receive  a  type 15 (1822L Name or
     
     Address Error), subtype 6 (down or non-effective  port)  message.

     When a host comes up on an IMP, or after there has been  a  break
     
     in   the  communications  between  the  host  and  its  IMP  (see
     
     1822(3.2)), the orderly flow of messages between the host and the
     
     IMP  needs  to  be properly (re)established.  This allows the IMP
     
     and host to recover from most any failure  in  the  other  or  in
     
     their communications path, including a break in mid-message.

     <a href="rfc851.html">RFC 851</a>
     
     
     
     The first messages that a host should send to its IMP  are  three
     
     NOP  messages.   Three  messages  are  required to insure that at
     
     least one message will be properly read by the IMP (the first NOP
     
     could be concatenated to a previous message if communications had
     
     been broken in mid-stream, and the third provides redundancy  for
     
     the   second).    These   NOPs   serve  several  functions:  they
     
     synchronize the IMP with the host, they tell  the  IMP  how  much
     
     padding  the  host  requires  between  the message leader and its
     
     body, and they also tell the IMP whether the host will  be  using
     
     <span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1822%20or%201822L%20leaders."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1822" name="section-1822">1822</a> or 1822L leaders.</span>
     
     
     Similarly, the IMP will send three  NOPs  to  the  host  when  it
     
     detects  that  the host has come up.  Actually, the IMP will send
     
     six NOPs, alternating three 1822  NOPs  with  three  1822L  NOPs.
     
     Thus, the host will see three NOPs no matter which protocol it is
     
     using.   The  NOPs  will  be  followed  by  two  Interface  Reset
     
     messages,  one of each style.  If the IMP receives a NOP from the
     
     host while the above sequence is occurring,  the  IMP  will  only
     
     send  the  remainder  of  the NOPs and the Interface Reset in the
     
     proper style.  The 1822 NOPs will contain the 1822 address of the
     
     host interface, and the 1822L NOPs will contain the corresponding
     
     1822L address.
     
     
     Once the IMP  and  the  host  have  sent  each  other  the  above
     
     messages, regular communications can commence.  See 1822(3.2) for

     When a host submits a regular message using an 1822  leader,  the
     
     IMP  checks  for  an  existing simplex virtual circuit connection
     
     from the  source  host  to  the  destination  host.   If  such  a
     
     connection   already  exists,  it  is  used.   Otherwise,  a  new
     
     connection from the source host port to the destination host port
     
     is  opened.   In either case, there may be at most eight messages
     
     outstanding on that connection  at  any  one  time.   If  a  host
     
     submits  a  ninth message on that connection before it receives a
     
     reply for the first message, then the host will be blocked  until
     
     the reply is sent for the first message.
     
     
     Such connections can stay open for some time, but are  timed  out
     
     after  three minutes of no activity, or can be closed if there is
     
     contention for the connection blocks  in  either  the  source  or
     
     destination  IMP.   However, a connection will never be closed as
     
     long as there are any outstanding messages on it.  This allows  a
     
     source  host  to  count the number of replies it has received for
     
     messages to each destination host address in order to avoid being
     
     blocked   by  submitting  a  ninth  outstanding  message  on  any

     connection.
     
     
     When a host submits a regular message using an  1822L  leader,  a
     
     similar process occurs, except that in this case, connections are
     
     distinguished by the source  name/destination  name  combination.
     
     When the message is received from a host, the IMP first looks for
     
     an open connection for that  same  source  name/destination  name
     
     pair.   If  such  a  connection is found, then it is used, and no
     
     further name translation is  performed.   If,  however,  no  open
     
     connection  was  found,  then the destination name is translated,
     
     and a connection opened to the physical host port.   As  long  as
     
     there are any outstanding messages on the connection it will stay
     
     open, and it will have  the  same  restriction  that  only  eight
     
     messages may be outstanding at any one time.  Thus, a source host
     
     can still count replies to avoid being blocked, but they must  be
     
     counted  on a source name/destination name pair basis, instead of
     
     just by destination host address as before.
     
     
     Since connections are based on the source name  as  well  as  the
     
     destination  name,  this  implies that there may be more than one
     
     open connection from physical host port A to physical  host  port
     
     B,   which   would   allow   more  than  8  outstanding  messages
     
     simultaneously from the first to the second port.   However,  for
     
     this  to  occur, either the source or destination names, or both,
     
     must differ from one connection to the next.  For example, if the
     
     
     
                                  - 23 -

     names  "543"  and  "677" both translate to physical port 3 on IMP
     
     51, then the host on that port could  open  four  connections  to
     
     itself  by  sending  messages  from "543" to "543", from "543" to
     
     "677", from "677" to "543", and from "677" to "677".
     
     
     As has already been stated,  the  destination  names  in  regular
     
     messages  are  only translated when connections are first opened.
     
     Once a connection is open, that connection, and  its  destination
     
     physical  host port, will continue to be used until it is closed.
     
     If, in the meantime, a "better" destination host  port  belonging
     
     to  the  same  destination name became available, it would not be
     
     used until the next time a  new  connection  is  opened  to  that
     
     destination name.

     There may  be  times  when  a  host  wants  to  perform  its  own
     
     translations,  or  might need the full list of physical addresses
     
     to which a particular name maps.  For example, a connection-based
     
     host-to-host  protocol  may  require  that the same physical host
     
     port on a multi-homed host be used for all  messages  using  that
     
     host-to-host  connection, and the host does not wish to trust the
     
     IMP to always deliver messages using a destination  name  to  the
     
     same host port.

     <a href="rfc851.html">RFC 851</a>
     
     
     
     In these cases, the host  can  submit  a  type  11  (Name  Server
     
     Request)  message to the IMP, which requests the IMP to translate
     
     the destination 1822L name and return a list of the addresses  to
     
     which  it maps.  The IMP will respond with a type 11 (Name Server
     
     Reply) message, which contains the selection policy  in  use  for
     
     that  name,  the  number of addresses to which the name maps, the
     
     addresses  themselves,  and  for  each  address,  whether  it  is
     
     effective and its routing distance from the IMP.  See <a href="#section-3.2">section 3.2</a>
     
     for a complete description of the message's contents.
     
     
     Using this information, the source  host  can  make  an  informed
     
     decision  on which of the physical host ports corresponding to an
     
     1822L name to use, and can subsequently send the messages to that
     
     port, rather than to the name.
     
     
     The IMP also supports a different type of name service.   A  host
     
     needs  to issue a Name Declaration Message to the IMP in order to
     
     make its names effective, but it may not wish to keep  its  names
     
     in  some table or file in the host.  In this case, it can ask the
     
     IMP to tell it which names it is authorized to use.
     
     
     In this case, the host submits a  type  12  (Port  List  Request)
     
     message to the IMP, and the IMP replies with a type 12 (Port List
     
     Reply) message.  It contains, for the host port  over  which  the
     
     IMP  received the request and sent the reply, the number of names

               An  NDM  with  zero  entries  will  cause  all  current
     
               effective names for the host to become non-effective.
     
          Type 4: NOP - This allows the IMP to  know  which  style  of
     
               leader  the  host wishes to use.  A 1822L NOP signifies
     
               that the host wishes to use 1822L leaders, and an  1822
     
               NOP signifies that the host wishes to use 1822 leaders.
     
               All of the other remarks concerning the NOP message  in
     
               1822(3.3)  still  hold.   The  host should always issue
     
               NOPs in groups of three to insure proper  reception  by
     
               the IMP.  Also see <a href="#section-2.4">section 2.4</a> for a further discussion
     
               on the use of the NOP message.
     
          Type 8: Error with Message ID - see 1822(3.3).
     
          Type 11: Name Server Request - This allows the host  to  use
     
               the  IMP's  logical addressing tables as a name server.
     
               The destination name in the 1822L leader is translated,
     
               and  the  IMP replies with a Name Server Reply message,
     
               which lists the physical host addresses  to  which  the
     
               destination name maps.
     
          Type 12: Port List Request - This allows the  physical  host
     
               to  request the list of names that map to the host port
     
               over which this request was received by the  IMP.   The
     
               IMP replies with a Port List Reply message, which lists
     
               the names that map to the port.

          This field contains one of the  source  host's  1822L  names

          automatically filled in by the IMP, as in the 1822 protocol,
     
          because the host may be known by several names and may  wish
     
          to use a particular name as the source of this message.  All
     
          messages from the same host need not use the  same  name  in

          authorization, effectiveness, and actually belonging to this
     
          host.  Messages using names that do not satisfy all of these
     
          requirements will not be delivered, and will instead  result
     
          in  an  error  message being sent back into the source host.
     
          If the host places its 1822L  address  in  this  field,  the
     
          address is checked to insure that it actually represents the
     
          host port where the message originated.  If the  message  is
     
          destined for an 1822 host on a non-C/30 IMP, this field MUST
