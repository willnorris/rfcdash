Abstract

   This document describes a private Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   header field (P-header) to be used by the European Telecommunications
   Standards Institute (ETSI) Telecommunications and Internet-converged
   Services and Protocols for Advanced Networks (TISPAN) for the purpose
   of authorizing early media flows in Third Generation Partnership
   Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS).  This header field is
   useful in any SIP network that is interconnected with other SIP
   networks and needs to control the flow of media in the early dialog
   state.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document defines the use of the P-Early-Media header field for
   use within SIP [<a href="#ref-1" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>1</a>] messages in certain SIP networks to authorize the
   cut-through of backward and/or forward early media when permitted by
   the early media policies of the networks involved.  The P-Early-Media
   header field is intended for use in a SIP network, such as a 3GPP IMS
   [<a href="#ref-13" title='"TS 23.228: IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS); Stage 2 (Release 7)"'>13</a>][14] that has the following characteristics: its early media
   policy prohibits the exchange of early media between end users; it is
   interconnected with other SIP networks that have unknown, untrusted,
   or different policies regarding early media; and it has the
   capability to "gate" (enable/disable) the flow of early media to/from
   user equipment.

   Within an isolated SIP network, it is possible to gate early media
   associated with all endpoints within the network to enforce a desired
   early media policy among network endpoints.  However, when a SIP
   network is interconnected with other SIP networks, only the boundary
   node connected to the external network can determine which early
   media policy to apply to a session established between endpoints on
   different sides of the boundary.  The P-Early-Media header field
   provides a means for this boundary node to communicate this early
   media policy decision to other nodes within the network.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Applicability%20Statement"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Applicability Statement</span>

   The use of this extension is only applicable inside a "Trust Domain"
   as defined in <a href="rfc3325.html">RFC 3325</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks"'>6</a>].  Nodes in such a Trust Domain are
   explicitly trusted by its users and end-systems to authorize early
   media requests only when allowed by early media policy within the
   Trust Domain.

   This document does NOT offer a general early media authorization
   model suitable for inter-domain use or use in the Internet at large.
   Furthermore, since the early media requests are not cryptographically
   certified, they are subject to forgery, replay, and falsification in
   any architecture that does not meet the requirements of the Trust
   Domain.

   An early media request also lacks an indication of who specifically
   is making or modifying the request, and so it must be assumed that
   the Trust Domain is making the request.  Therefore, the information
   is only meaningful when securely received from a node known to be a
   member of the Trust Domain.

   Although this extension can be used with parallel forking, it does
   not improve on the known problems with early media and parallel
   forking, as described in <a href="rfc3960.html">RFC 3960</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Early Media and Ringing Tone Generation in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>4</a>], unless one can assume the use
   of symmetric RTP.

   Despite these limitations, there are sufficiently useful specialized
   deployments that meet the assumptions described above, and can accept
   the limitations that result, to warrant publication of this
   mechanism.  An example deployment would be a closed network that
   emulates a traditional circuit switched telephone network.

   PSTN networks typically provide call progress information as backward
   early media from the terminating switch towards the calling party.
   PSTN networks also use forward early media from the calling party
   towards the terminating switch under some circumstances for
   applications, such as digit collection for secondary dialing.  PSTN
   networks typically allow backward and/or forward early media since
   they are used for the purpose of progressing the call to the answer
   state and do not involve the exchange of data between endpoints.

   In a SIP network, backward early media flows from the User Agent
   Server (UAS) towards the User Agent Client (UAC).  Forward early
   media flows from the UAC towards the UAS.  SIP networks by default
   allow both forms of early media, which may carry user data, once the
   media path is established.  Early media is typically desirable with a
   PSTN gateway as UAS, but not with SIP user equipment as UAS.

   To prevent the exchange of user data within early media while
   allowing early media via PSTN gateways, a SIP network may have a
   policy to prohibit backward early media from SIP user equipment and
   to prohibit forward media towards SIP user equipment, either of which
   may contain user data.  A SIP network containing both PSTN gateways
   and SIP end devices, for example, can maintain such an early media
   policy by gating "off" any early media with a SIP end device acting
   as UAS, gating "on" early media with a SIP end device acting as UAC,
   and gating "on" early media at each PSTN gateway.

   Unfortunately, a SIP network interconnected with another SIP network
   may have no means of assuring that the interconnected network is
   implementing a compatible early media policy, thus allowing the
   exchange of user data within early media under some circumstances.
   For example, if a network "A" allows all early media with user
   equipment as UAC and an interconnected network "B" allows all early
   media with user equipment as UAS, any session established between
   user equipment as UAC in "A" and user equipment as UAS in "B" will
   allow bidirectional user data exchange as early media.  Other
   combinations of early media policies may also produce similar
   undesirable results.

   The purpose of the extension is to allow a SIP network interconnected
   to other SIP networks with different early media policies to
   correctly identify and enable authorized early media according to its
   policies.

   Backward early media in the PSTN typically comprises call progress
   information, such as ringing feedback ("ringback"), or announcements
   regarding special handling such as forwarding.  It may also include
   requests for further information, such as a credit card number to be
   entered as forward early media in the form of Dual Tone Multi-
   Frequency (DTMF) tones or speech.  Backward early media of this type
   provides information to the calling party strictly for the purpose of
   progressing the call and involves no exchange of data between end
   users.  The usual PSTN charging policy assumes that no data is
   exchanged between users until the call has been answered.

   A terminating SIP User Agent (UA) outside of the SIP network, on the
   other hand, may provide any user data in a backward early media
   stream.  Thus, if the network implements the usual early media
   policy, the network equipment gating the backward early media flow
   for the originating UA must distinguish between authorized early
   media from a terminating SIP endpoint and unauthorized early media
   from another SIP device outside of the network.  Given the assumption
   of a transitive trust relationship between SIP servers in the
   network, this can be accomplished by including some information in a
   backward SIP message that identifies the presence of authorized
   backward early media.  Since it is necessary to verify that this
   indication comes from a trusted source, it is necessary for each
   server on the path back to the originating UA to be able to verify
   the trust relationship with the previous server and to remove such an
   indication when it cannot do so.  A server on the boundary to an
   untrusted SIP network can assure that no indication of authorized
   backward early media passes from an external UAS to a UAC within the
   network.  Thus, the use of a private header field that can be
   modified by SIP proxies is to be preferred over the use of a
   Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) attachment that cannot
   be modified in this way.

   Forward early media is less common than backward early media in the
   PSTN.  It is typically used to collect secondary dialed digits, to
   collect credit card numbers, or to collect other DTMF or speech
   responses for the purpose of further directing the call.  Forward
   early media in the PSTN is always directed toward a network server

   for the purpose of progressing a call and involves no exchange of
   data between end users.

   A terminating SIP UA outside of the SIP network, on the other hand,
   may receive any user data in a forward early media stream.  Thus, if
   the network implements the usual early media policy, the network
   equipment gating the forward early media flow for the originating UA
   must distinguish between a terminating endpoint that is authorized to
   receive forward early media, and another SIP device outside of the
   network that is not authorized to receive forward early media
   containing user data.  This authorization can be accomplished in the
   same manner as for backward early media by including some information
   in a backward SIP message that identifies that the terminating side
   is authorized to receive forward early media.

   The private header extension defined in this document is applicable
   to the gateway model defined in <a href="rfc3960.html">RFC 3960</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Early Media and Ringing Tone Generation in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>4</a>], since the PSTN gateway
   is the primary requestor of early media in an IMS.  For the same
   reason, neither the application server model of <a href="rfc3960.html">RFC 3960</a>, nor the
   early-session disposition type defined in <a href="rfc3959.html">RFC 3959</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Early Session Disposition Type for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>3</a>] is applicable.

   The gateway model of <a href="rfc3960.html">RFC 3960</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Early Media and Ringing Tone Generation in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>4</a>] allows for individual networks to
   create local policy with respect to the handling of early media, but
   does not address the case where a network is interconnected with
   other networks with unknown, untrusted, or different early media
   policies.  Without the kind of information in the P-Early-Media
   header field, it is not possible for the network to determine whether
   cut-through of early media could lead to the transfer of data between
   end-users during session establishment.

   Thus, the private header extension in this document is a natural
   extension of the gateway model of <a href="rfc3960.html">RFC 3960</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Early Media and Ringing Tone Generation in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>4</a>] that is applicable

   This document defines a new P-Early-Media header field for the
   purpose of requesting and authorizing requests for backward and/or
   forward early media.  A UAC capable of recognizing the P-Early-Media
   header field may include the header field in an INVITE request.  The
   P-Early-Media header field in an INVITE request contains the
   "supported" parameter.

   As members of the Trust Domain, each proxy receiving an INVITE
   request must decide whether to insert or delete the P-Early-Media
   header field before forwarding.

   A UAS receiving an INVITE request can use the presence of the P-
   Early-Media header field in the request to decide whether to request
   early media authorization in subsequent messages towards the UAC.
   After receiving an incoming INVITE request, the UAS requesting
   backward and/or forward early media will include the P-Early-Media
   header field in a message towards the UAC within the dialog,
   including direction parameter(s) that identify for each media line in
   the session whether the early media request is for backward media,
   forward media, both, or neither.  The UAS can change its request for
   early media by including a modified P-Early-Media header field in a
   subsequent message towards the UAC within the dialog.

   Each proxy in the network receiving the P-Early-Media header field in
   a message towards the UAC has the responsibility for assuring that
   the early media request comes from an authorized source.  If a P-
   Early-Media header field arrives from either an untrusted source, a
   source not allowed to send backward early media, or a source not
   allowed to receive forward early media, then the proxy may remove the
   P-Early-Media header field or alter the direction parameter(s) of the
   P-Early-Media header field before forwarding the message, based on
   local policy.

   A proxy in the network not receiving the P-Early-Media header field
   in a message towards the UAC may insert one based on local policy.

   If the proxy also performs gating of early media, then it uses the
   parameter(s) of the P-Early-Media header field to decide whether to
   open or close the gates for backward and forward early media flow(s)
   between the UAs.  The proxy performing gating of early media may also
   add a "gated" parameter to the P-Early-Media header field before
   forwarding the message so that other gating proxies in the path can
   choose to leave open their gates.

   If the UAC is a trusted server within the network (e.g., a PSTN
   gateway), then the UAC may use the parameter(s) of the P-Early-Media
   header field in messages received from the UAS to decide whether to
   perform early media gating or cut-through and to decide whether or
   not to render backward early media in preference to generating
   ringback based on the receipt of a 180 Ringing response.

   If the UAC is associated with user equipment, then the network will
   have assigned a proxy the task of performing early media gating, so
   that the parameter(s) of the P-Early-Media header field received at
   such a UAC do not require that the UAC police the early media
   flow(s), but they do provide additional information that the UAC may
   use to render media.

   The UAC and proxies in the network may also insert, delete, or modify
   the P-Early-Media header field in messages towards the UAS within the
   dialog according to local policy, but the interpretation of the
   header field when used in this way is a matter of local policy and
   not defined herein.  The use of direction parameter(s) in this header
   field could be used to inform the UAS of the final early media
   authorization status.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20Limitations%20of%20the%20P-Early-Media%20Header%20Field"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  Limitations of the P-Early-Media Header Field</span>

   The P-Early-Media header field does not apply to any SDP with
   Content-Disposition: early-session [<a href="#ref-3" title='"The Early Session Disposition Type for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>3</a>].

   When parallel forking occurs, there is no reliable way to correlate
   early media authorization in a dialog with the media from the
   corresponding endpoint unless one can assume the use of symmetric
   RTP, since the SDP messages do not identify the RTP source address of
   any media stream.  When a UAC or proxy receives multiple early
   dialogs and cannot accurately identify the source of each media
   stream, it SHOULD use the most restrictive early media authorization
   it receives on any of the dialogs to decide the policy to apply
   towards all received media.  When early media usage is desired for
   any reason and one cannot assume the use of symmetric RTP, it is
   advisable to disable parallel forking using callerprefs [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Caller Preferences for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>9</a>].

   Although the implementation of media gating is outside the scope of
   this extension, note that media gating must be implemented carefully
   in the presence of NATs and protocols that aid in NAT traversal.
   Media gating may also introduce a potential for media clipping that
   is similar to that created during parallel forking or any other
   feature that may disable early media, such as custom ringback.

   The P-Early-Media header field with the "supported" parameter MAY be
   included in an INVITE request to indicate that the UAC or a proxy on

   A network entity MAY request the authorization of early media or
   change a request for authorization of early media by including the
   P-Early-Media header field in any message allowed by Table 1 within
   the dialog towards the sender of the INVITE request.  The P-Early-
   Media header field includes one or more direction parameters where
   each has one of the values: "sendrecv", "sendonly", "recvonly", or
   "inactive", following the convention used for Session Description

   silently discarded.  Non-direction parameters are ignored for
   purposes of early media authorization.  If there are more direction
   parameters than media lines, the excess SHALL be silently discarded.
   If there are fewer direction parameters than media lines, the value
   of the last direction parameter SHALL apply to all remaining media
   lines.  A message directed towards the UAC containing a P-Early-Media
   header field with no recognized direction parameters SHALL NOT be
   interpreted as an early media authorization request.

   The parameter value "sendrecv" indicates a request for authorization
   of early media associated with the corresponding media line, both
   from the UAS towards the UAC and from the UAC towards the UAS (both
   backward and forward early media).  The value "sendonly" indicates a
   request for authorization of early media from the UAS towards the UAC
   (backward early media), and not in the other direction.  The value
   "recvonly" indicates a request for authorization of early media from
   the UAC towards the UAS (forward early media), and not in the other
   direction.  The value "inactive" indicates either a request that no
   early media associated with the corresponding media line be
   authorized, or a request for revocation of authorization of
   previously authorized early media.

   The P-Early-Media header field in any message within a dialog towards
   the sender of the INVITE request MAY also include the non-direction
   parameter "gated" to indicate that a network entity on the path
   towards the UAS is already gating the early media, according to the
   direction parameter(s).  When included in the P-Early-Media header
   field, the "gated" parameter SHALL come after all direction
   parameters in the parameter list.

   When receiving a message directed toward the UAC without the P-
   Early-Media header field and no previous early media authorization
   request has been received within the dialog, the default early media
   authorization depends on local policy and may depend on whether the
   header field was included in the INVITE request.  After an early
   media authorization request has been received within a dialog, and a
   subsequent message is received without the P-Early-Media header
   field, the previous early media authorization remains unchanged.

   The P-Early-Media header field in any message within a dialog towards
   the UAS MAY be ignored or interpreted according to local policy.

   The P-Early-Media header field does not interact with SDP
   offer/answer procedures in any way.  Early media authorization is not
   influenced by the state of the SDP offer/answer procedures (including
   preconditions and directionality) and does not influence the state of
   the SDP offer/answer procedures.  The P-Early-Media header field may
   or may not be present in messages containing SDP.  The most recently

   received early media authorization applies to the corresponding media
   line in the session established for the dialog until receipt of the

   consisting of a collection of SIP servers maintaining pair wise
   security associations.

   Within the trust domain of a network it is only necessary to police
   the use of the P-Early-Media header field at the boundary to user
   equipment served by the network and at the boundary to peer networks.
   It is assumed that boundary servers in the trust domain of a network
   will have local policy for the treatment of the P-Early-Media header
   field as it is sent to or received from any possible server external
   to the network.  Since boundary servers are free to modify or remove
   any P-Early-Media header field in SIP messages forwarded across the
   boundary, the integrity of the P-Early-Media header field can be
   verified to the extent that the connections to external servers are
   secured.  The authenticity of the P-Early-Media header field can only
   be assured to the extent that the external servers are trusted to
   police the authenticity of the header field.
