<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Human beings on our planet have, past and present, used a number of
   languages.  There are many reasons why one would want to identify the
   language used when presenting or requesting information.

   A user's language preferences often need to be identified so that
   appropriate processing can be applied.  For example, the user's
   language preferences in a Web browser can be used to select Web pages
   appropriately.  Language preferences can also be used to select among
   tools (such as dictionaries) to assist in the processing or
   understanding of content in different languages.

   In addition, knowledge about the particular language used by some
   piece of information content might be useful or even required by some
   types of processing; for example, spell-checking, computer-
   synthesized speech, Braille transcription, or high-quality print
   renderings.

   One means of indicating the language used is by labeling the
   information content with an identifier or "tag".  These tags can be
   used to specify user preferences when selecting information content,
   or for labeling additional attributes of content and associated
   resources.

   Tags can also be used to indicate additional language attributes of
   content.  For example, indicating specific information about the
   dialect, writing system, or orthography used in a document or
   resource may enable the user to obtain information in a form that
   they can understand, or it can be important in processing or
   rendering the given content into an appropriate form or style.

   This document specifies a particular identifier mechanism (the
   language tag) and a registration function for values to be used to
   form tags.  It also defines a mechanism for private use values and
   future extension.

   This document, in combination with [<a href="rfc4647.html" title='"Matching of Language Tags"'>RFC4647</a>], replaces [<a href="rfc3066.html" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>RFC3066</a>],
   which replaced [<a href="rfc1766.html" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>RFC1766</a>].  For a list of changes in this document,

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   Language tags are used to help identify languages, whether spoken,
   written, signed, or otherwise signaled, for the purpose of
   communication.  This includes constructed and artificial languages,
   but excludes languages not intended primarily for human
   communication, such as programming languages.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Syntax"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Syntax</span>

   The language tag is composed of one or more parts, known as
   "subtags".  Each subtag consists of a sequence of alphanumeric
   characters.  Subtags are distinguished and separated from one another
   by a hyphen ("-", ABNF [<a href="rfc4234.html" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC4234</a>] %x2D).  A language tag consists of a
   "primary language" subtag and a (possibly empty) series of subsequent
   subtags, each of which refines or narrows the range of languages
   identified by the overall tag.

   Usually, each type of subtag is distinguished by length, position in
   the tag, and content: subtags can be recognized solely by these
   features.  The only exception to this is a fixed list of
   grandfathered tags registered under <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> [<a href="rfc3066.html" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>RFC3066</a>].  This makes
   it possible to construct a parser that can extract and assign some
   semantic information to the subtags, even if the specific subtag
   values are not recognized.  Thus, a parser need not have an up-to-
   date copy (or any copy at all) of the subtag registry to perform most
   searching and matching operations.

   The syntax of the language tag in ABNF [<a href="rfc4234.html" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC4234</a>] is:

   Language-Tag  = langtag
                 / privateuse             ; private use tag
                 / grandfathered          ; grandfathered registrations

   langtag       = (language
                    ["-" script]

   language      = (2*3ALPHA [ extlang ]) ; shortest ISO 639 code

   extlang       = *3("-" 3ALPHA)         ; reserved for future use

   script        = 4ALPHA                 ; ISO 15924 code

   region        = 2ALPHA                 ; ISO 3166 code
                 / 3DIGIT                 ; UN M.49 code

   variant       = 5*8alphanum            ; registered variants
                 / (DIGIT 3alphanum)

   extension     = singleton 1*("-" (2*8alphanum))

   singleton     = %x41-57 / %x59-5A / %x61-77 / %x79-7A / DIGIT
                 ; "a"-"w" / "y"-"z" / "A"-"W" / "Y"-"Z" / "0"-"9"
                 ; Single letters: x/X is reserved for private use

   privateuse    = ("x"/"X") 1*("-" (1*8alphanum))

   grandfathered = 1*3ALPHA 1*2("-" (2*8alphanum))
                   ; grandfathered registration
                   ; Note: i is the only singleton
                   ; that starts a grandfathered tag

   alphanum      = (ALPHA / DIGIT)       ; letters and numbers

                        Figure 1: Language Tag ABNF

   Note: There is a subtlety in the ABNF for 'variant': variants
   starting with a digit MAY be four characters long, while those
   starting with a letter MUST be at least five characters long.

   All subtags have a maximum length of eight characters and whitespace
   is not permitted in a language tag.  For examples of language tags,
   see <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

   Note that although [<a href="rfc4234.html" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC4234</a>] refers to octets, the language tags
   described in this document are sequences of characters from the
   US-ASCII [<a href="#ref-ISO646" title='"ISO/IEC 646:1991, Information technology -- ISO 7-bit coded character set for information interchange."'>ISO646</a>] repertoire.  Language tags MAY be used in documents
   and applications that use other encodings, so long as these encompass
   the US-ASCII repertoire.  An example of this would be an XML document
   that uses the UTF-16LE [<a href="rfc2781.html" title='"UTF-16, an encoding of ISO 10646"'>RFC2781</a>] encoding of [<a href="#ref-Unicode" title='"The Unicode Standard, Version 5.0"'>Unicode</a>].

   The tags and their subtags, including private use and extensions, are
   to be treated as case insensitive: there exist conventions for the
   capitalization of some of the subtags, but these MUST NOT be taken to
   carry meaning.

   For example:

   o  [<a href="#ref-ISO639-1" title='"ISO 639-1:2002. Codes for the representation of names of languages -- Part 1: Alpha-2 code"'>ISO639-1</a>] recommends that language codes be written in lowercase
      ('mn' Mongolian).

   o  [<a href="#ref-ISO3166-1" title='"ISO 3166-1:1997. Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions -- Part 1: Country codes"'>ISO3166-1</a>] recommends that country codes be capitalized ('MN'
      Mongolia).

   o  [<a href="#ref-ISO15924" title='"ISO 15924:2004. Information and documentation -- Codes for the representation of names of scripts"'>ISO15924</a>] recommends that script codes use lowercase with the
      initial letter capitalized ('Cyrl' Cyrillic).

   However, in the tags defined by this document, the uppercase US-ASCII
   letters in the range 'A' through 'Z' are considered equivalent and
   mapped directly to their US-ASCII lowercase equivalents in the range
   'a' through 'z'.  Thus, the tag "mn-Cyrl-MN" is not distinct from
   "MN-cYRL-mn" or "mN-cYrL-Mn" (or any other combination), and each of
   these variations conveys the same meaning: Mongolian written in the
   Cyrillic script as used in Mongolia.

   Although case distinctions do not carry meaning in language tags,
   consistent formatting and presentation of the tags will aid users.
   The format of the tags and subtags in the registry is RECOMMENDED.
   In this format, all non-initial two-letter subtags are uppercase, all
   non-initial four-letter subtags are titlecase, and all other subtags
   are lowercase.

   The namespace of language tags and their subtags is administered by
   the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) [<a href="rfc2860.html" title='"Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Technical Work of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority"'>RFC2860</a>] according to
   the rules in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> of this document.  The Language Subtag
   Registry maintained by IANA is the source for valid subtags: other
   standards referenced in this section provide the source material for
   that registry.

   Terminology in this section:

   o  Tag or tags refers to a complete language tag, such as
      "fr-Latn-CA".  Examples of tags in this document are enclosed in
      double-quotes ("en-US").

   o  Subtag refers to a specific section of a tag, delimited by hyphen,
      such as the subtag 'Latn' in "fr-Latn-CA".  Examples of subtags in
      this document are enclosed in single quotes ('Latn').

   o  Code or codes refers to values defined in external standards (and
      that are used as subtags in this document).  For example, 'Latn'
      is an [<a href="#ref-ISO15924" title='"ISO 15924:2004. Information and documentation -- Codes for the representation of names of scripts"'>ISO15924</a>] script code that was used to define the 'Latn'
      script subtag for use in a language tag.  Examples of codes in
      this document are enclosed in single quotes ('en', 'Latn').

   The definitions in this section apply to the various subtags within
   the language tags defined by this document, excepting those
   "grandfathered" tags defined in <a href="#section-2.2.8">Section 2.2.8</a>.

   Language tags are designed so that each subtag type has unique length
   and content restrictions.  These make identification of the subtag's
   type possible, even if the content of the subtag itself is
   unrecognized.  This allows tags to be parsed and processed without
   reference to the latest version of the underlying standards or the
   IANA registry and makes the associated exception handling when
   parsing tags simpler.

   Subtags in the IANA registry that do not come from an underlying
   standard can only appear in specific positions in a tag.
   Specifically, they can only occur as primary language subtags or as
   variant subtags.

   Note that sequences of private use and extension subtags MUST occur
   at the end of the sequence of subtags and MUST NOT be interspersed
   with subtags defined elsewhere in this document.

   Single-letter and single-digit subtags are reserved for current or
   future use.  These include the following current uses:



<span class="grey">Phillips &amp; Davis         Best Current Practice                  [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-8" id="page-8" name="page-8"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4646.html">RFC 4646</a>             Tags for Identifying Languages       September 2006</span>


   o  The single-letter subtag 'x' is reserved to introduce a sequence
      of private use subtags.  The interpretation of any private use
      subtags is defined solely by private agreement and is not defined
      by the rules in this section or in any standard or registry
      defined in this document.

   o  All other single-letter subtags are reserved to introduce
      standardized extension subtag sequences as described in
      <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>.

   The single-letter subtag 'i' is used by some grandfathered tags, such
   as "i-enochian", where it always appears in the first position and
   cannot be confused with an extension.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.1.%20%20Primary%20Language%20Subtag"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.1" name="section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  Primary Language Subtag</span>

   The primary language subtag is the first subtag in a language tag
   (with the exception of private use and certain grandfathered tags)
   and cannot be omitted.  The following rules apply to the primary
   language subtag:

   1.  All two-character language subtags were defined in the IANA
       registry according to the assignments found in the standard ISO
       639 Part 1, "ISO 639-1:2002, Codes for the representation of
       names of languages -- Part 1: Alpha-2 code" [<a href="#ref-ISO639-1" title='"ISO 639-1:2002. Codes for the representation of names of languages -- Part 1: Alpha-2 code"'>ISO639-1</a>], or using
       assignments subsequently made by the ISO 639 Part 1 maintenance
       agency or governing standardization bodies.

   2.  All three-character language subtags were defined in the IANA
       registry according to the assignments found in ISO 639 Part 2,
       "ISO 639-2:1998 - Codes for the representation of names of
       languages -- Part 2: Alpha-3 code - edition 1" [<a href="#ref-ISO639-2" title='"ISO 639-2:1998. Codes for the representation of names of languages -- Part 2: Alpha-3 code, first edition"'>ISO639-2</a>], or
       assignments subsequently made by the ISO 639 Part 2 maintenance
       agency or governing standardization bodies.

   3.  The subtags in the range 'qaa' through 'qtz' are reserved for
       private use in language tags.  These subtags correspond to codes
       reserved by ISO 639-2 for private use.  These codes MAY be used
       for non-registered primary language subtags (instead of using
       private use subtags following 'x-').  Please refer to <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>
       for more information on private use subtags.

   4.  All four-character language subtags are reserved for possible
       future standardization.

   5.  All language subtags of 5 to 8 characters in length in the IANA
       registry were defined via the registration process in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>
       and MAY be used to form the primary language subtag.  At the time



<span class="grey">Phillips &amp; Davis         Best Current Practice                  [Page 8]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-9" id="page-9" name="page-9"> </a>

       this document was created, there were no examples of this kind of
       subtag and future registrations of this type will be discouraged:
       primary languages are strongly RECOMMENDED for registration with
       ISO 639, and proposals rejected by ISO 639/RA will be closely
       scrutinized before they are registered with IANA.

   6.  The single-character subtag 'x' as the primary subtag indicates
       that the language tag consists solely of subtags whose meaning is
       defined by private agreement.  For example, in the tag "x-fr-CH",
       the subtags 'fr' and 'CH' SHOULD NOT be taken to represent the
       French language or the country of Switzerland (or any other value
       in the IANA registry) unless there is a private agreement in
       place to do so.  See <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>.

   7.  The single-character subtag 'i' is used by some grandfathered
       tags (see <a href="#section-2.2.8">Section 2.2.8</a>) such as "i-klingon" and "i-bnn".  (Other
       grandfathered tags have a primary language subtag in their first
       position.)

   8.  Other values MUST NOT be assigned to the primary subtag except by
       revision or update of this document.

   Note: For languages that have both an ISO 639-1 two-character code
   and an ISO 639-2 three-character code, only the ISO 639-1 two-
   character code is defined in the IANA registry.

   Note: For languages that have no ISO 639-1 two-character code and for
   which the ISO 639-2/T (Terminology) code and the ISO 639-2/B
   (Bibliographic) codes differ, only the Terminology code is defined in
   the IANA registry.  At the time this document was created, all
   languages that had both kinds of three-character code were also
   assigned a two-character code; it is not expected that future
   assignments of this nature will occur.

   Note: To avoid problems with versioning and subtag choice as
   experienced during the transition between <a href="rfc1766.html">RFC 1766</a> and <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a>, as
   well as the canonical nature of subtags defined by this document, the
   ISO 639 Registration Authority Joint Advisory Committee (ISO 639/
   RA-JAC) has included the following statement in [<a href="#ref-iso639.prin" title='"ISO 639 Joint Advisory Committee: Working principles for ISO 639 maintenance"'>iso639.prin</a>]:

   "A language code already in ISO 639-2 at the point of freezing ISO
   639-1 shall not later be added to ISO 639-1.  This is to ensure
   consistency in usage over time, since users are directed in Internet
   applications to employ the alpha-3 code when an alpha-2 code for that
   language is not available."






<span class="grey">Phillips &amp; Davis         Best Current Practice                  [Page 9]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-10" id="page-10" name="page-10"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4646.html">RFC 4646</a>             Tags for Identifying Languages       September 2006</span>


   In order to avoid instability in the canonical form of tags, if a
   two-character code is added to ISO 639-1 for a language for which a
   three-character code was already included in ISO 639-2, the two-
   character code MUST NOT be registered.  See <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.

   For example, if some content were tagged with 'haw' (Hawaiian), which
   currently has no two-character code, the tag would not be invalidated
   if ISO 639-1 were to assign a two-character code to the Hawaiian
   language at a later date.

   For example, one of the grandfathered IANA registrations is
   "i-enochian".  The subtag 'enochian' could be registered in the IANA
   registry as a primary language subtag (assuming that ISO 639 does not
   register this language first), making tags such as "enochian-AQ" and
   "enochian-Latn" valid.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.2.%20%20Extended%20Language%20Subtags"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2" name="section-2.2.2">2.2.2</a>.  Extended Language Subtags</span>

   The following rules apply to the extended language subtags:

   1.  Three-letter subtags immediately following the primary subtag are
       reserved for future standardization, anticipating work that is
       currently under way on ISO 639.

   2.  Extended language subtags MUST follow the primary subtag and
       precede any other subtags.

   3.  There MAY be up to three extended language subtags.

   4.  Extended language subtags MUST NOT be registered or used to form
       language tags.  Their syntax is described here so that
       implementations can be compatible with any future revision of
       this document that does provide for their registration.

   Extended language subtag records, once they appear in the registry,
   MUST include exactly one 'Prefix' field indicating an appropriate
   language subtag or sequence of subtags that MUST always appear as a
   prefix to the extended language subtag.

   Example: In a future revision or update of this document, the tag
   "zh-gan" (registered under <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a>) might become a valid non-
   grandfathered (that is, redundant) tag in which the subtag 'gan'
   might represent the Chinese dialect 'Gan'.

   Script subtags are used to indicate the script or writing system
   variations that distinguish the written forms of a language or its
   dialects.  The following rules apply to the script subtags:

   1.  All four-character subtags were defined according to
       [<a href="#ref-ISO15924" title='"ISO 15924:2004. Information and documentation -- Codes for the representation of names of scripts"'>ISO15924</a>]--"Codes for the representation of names of scripts":
       alpha-4 script codes, or subsequently assigned by the ISO 15924
       maintenance agency or governing standardization bodies, denoting
       the script or writing system used in conjunction with this
       language.

   2.  Script subtags MUST immediately follow the primary language
       subtag and all extended language subtags and MUST occur before
       any other type of subtag described below.

   3.  The script subtags 'Qaaa' through 'Qabx' are reserved for private
       use in language tags.  These subtags correspond to codes reserved
       by ISO 15924 for private use.  These codes MAY be used for non-
       registered script values.  Please refer to <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a> for more
       information on private use subtags.

   4.  Script subtags MUST NOT be registered using the process in
       <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a> of this document.  Variant subtags MAY be considered
       for registration for that purpose.

   5.  There MUST be at most one script subtag in a language tag, and
       the script subtag SHOULD be omitted when it adds no
       distinguishing value to the tag or when the primary language
       subtag's record includes a Suppress-Script field listing the
       applicable script subtag.

   Example: "sr-Latn" represents Serbian written using the Latin script.

   Region subtags are used to indicate linguistic variations associated
   with or appropriate to a specific country, territory, or region.
   Typically, a region subtag is used to indicate regional dialects or
   usage, or region-specific spelling conventions.  A region subtag can
   also be used to indicate that content is expressed in a way that is
   appropriate for use throughout a region, for instance, Spanish
   content tailored to be useful throughout Latin America.

   1.  Region subtags MUST follow any language, extended language, or
       script subtags and MUST precede all other subtags.

   2.  All two-character subtags following the primary subtag were
       defined in the IANA registry according to the assignments found
       in [<a href="#ref-ISO3166-1" title='"ISO 3166-1:1997. Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions -- Part 1: Country codes"'>ISO3166-1</a>] ("Codes for the representation of names of
       countries and their subdivisions -- Part 1: Country codes") using
       the list of alpha-2 country codes, or using assignments
       subsequently made by the ISO 3166 maintenance agency or governing
       standardization bodies.

   3.  All three-character subtags consisting of digit (numeric)
       characters following the primary subtag were defined in the IANA
       registry according to the assignments found in UN Standard
       Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use [<a href="#ref-UN_M.49" title='"Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use"'>UN_M.49</a>] or
       assignments subsequently made by the governing standards body.
       Note that not all of the UN M.49 codes are defined in the IANA
       registry.  The following rules define which codes are entered
       into the registry as valid subtags:

       A.  UN numeric codes assigned to 'macro-geographical
           (continental)' or sub-regions MUST be registered in the
           registry.  These codes are not associated with an assigned
           ISO 3166 alpha-2 code and represent supra-national areas,
           usually covering more than one nation, state, province, or
           territory.

       B.  UN numeric codes for 'economic groupings' or 'other
           groupings' MUST NOT be registered in the IANA registry and
           MUST NOT be used to form language tags.

       C.  UN numeric codes for countries or areas with ambiguous ISO
           3166 alpha-2 codes, when entered into the registry, MUST be
           defined according to the rules in <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a> and MUST be
           used to form language tags that represent the country or
           region for which they are defined.

       D.  UN numeric codes for countries or areas for which there is an
           associated ISO 3166 alpha-2 code in the registry MUST NOT be
           entered into the registry and MUST NOT be used to form
           language tags.  Note that the ISO 3166-based subtag in the
           registry MUST actually be associated with the UN M.49 code in
           question.

       E.  UN numeric codes and ISO 3166 alpha-2 codes for countries or
           areas listed as eligible for registration in [<a href="rfc4645.html" title='"Initial Language Subtag Registry"'>RFC4645</a>] but
           not presently registered MAY be entered into the IANA
           registry via the process described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.  Once
           registered, these codes MAY be used to form language tags.

       F.  All other UN numeric codes for countries or areas that do not
           have an associated ISO 3166 alpha-2 code MUST NOT be entered
           into the registry and MUST NOT be used to form language tags.
           For more information about these codes, see <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.

   4.  Note: The alphanumeric codes in <a href="#appendix-X">Appendix X</a> of the UN document
       MUST NOT be entered into the registry and MUST NOT be used to
       form language tags.  (At the time this document was created,
       these values matched the ISO 3166 alpha-2 codes.)

   5.  There MUST be at most one region subtag in a language tag and the
       region subtag MAY be omitted, as when it adds no distinguishing
       value to the tag.

   6.  The region subtags 'AA', 'QM'-'QZ', 'XA'-'XZ', and 'ZZ' are
       reserved for private use in language tags.  These subtags
       correspond to codes reserved by ISO 3166 for private use.  These
       codes MAY be used for private use region subtags (instead of
       using a private use subtag sequence).  Please refer to
       <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a> for more information on private use subtags.

   "de-CH" represents German ('de') as used in Switzerland ('CH').

   "sr-Latn-CS" represents Serbian ('sr') written using Latin script
   ('Latn') as used in Serbia and Montenegro ('CS').

   "es-419" represents Spanish ('es') appropriate to the UN-defined
   Latin America and Caribbean region ('419').

   Variant subtags are used to indicate additional, well-recognized
   variations that define a language or its dialects that are not
   covered by other available subtags.  The following rules apply to the
   variant subtags:

   1.  Variant subtags are not associated with any external standard.
       Variant subtags and their meanings are defined by the
       registration process defined in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.

   2.  Variant subtags MUST follow all of the other defined subtags, but
       precede any extension or private use subtag sequences.

   3.  More than one variant MAY be used to form the language tag.

   4.  Variant subtags MUST be registered with IANA according to the
       rules in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a> of this document before being used to form
       language tags.  In order to distinguish variants from other types
       of subtags, registrations MUST meet the following length and
       content restrictions:

       1.  Variant subtags that begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) MUST be
           at least five characters long.

       2.  Variant subtags that begin with a digit (0-9) MUST be at
           least four characters long.

   Variant subtag records in the language subtag registry MAY include
   one or more 'Prefix' fields, which indicate the language tag or tags
   that would make a suitable prefix (with other subtags, as
   appropriate) in forming a language tag with the variant.  For
   example, the subtag 'nedis' has a Prefix of "sl", making it suitable
   to form language tags such as "sl-nedis" and "sl-IT-nedis", but not
   suitable for use in a tag such as "zh-nedis" or "it-IT-nedis".

   "sl-nedis" represents the Natisone or Nadiza dialect of Slovenian.

   "de-CH-1996" represents German as used in Switzerland and as written
   using the spelling reform beginning in the year 1996 C.E.

   Most variants that share a prefix are mutually exclusive.  For
   example, the German orthographic variations '1996' and '1901' SHOULD
   NOT be used in the same tag, as they represent the dates of different
   spelling reforms.  A variant that can meaningfully be used in
   combination with another variant SHOULD include a 'Prefix' field in
   its registry record that lists that other variant.  For example, if
   another German variant 'example' were created that made sense to use
   with '1996', then 'example' should include two Prefix fields: "de"
   and "de-1996".

   Extensions provide a mechanism for extending language tags for use in
   various applications.  See <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>.  The following rules apply to
   extensions:

   1.   Extension subtags are separated from the other subtags defined
        in this document by a single-character subtag ("singleton").
        The singleton MUST be one allocated to a registration authority
        via the mechanism described in <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a> and MUST NOT be the
        letter 'x', which is reserved for private use subtag sequences.



<span class="grey">Phillips &amp; Davis         Best Current Practice                 [Page 14]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-15" id="page-15" name="page-15"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4646.html">RFC 4646</a>             Tags for Identifying Languages       September 2006</span>


   2.   Note: Private use subtag sequences starting with the singleton
        subtag 'x' are described in <a href="#section-2.2.7">Section 2.2.7</a> below.

   3.   An extension MUST follow at least a primary language subtag.
        That is, a language tag cannot begin with an extension.
        Extensions extend language tags, they do not override or replace
        them.  For example, "a-value" is not a well-formed language tag,
        while "de-a-value" is.

   4.   Each singleton subtag MUST appear at most one time in each tag
        (other than as a private use subtag).  That is, singleton
        subtags MUST NOT be repeated.  For example, the tag
        "en-a-bbb-a-ccc" is invalid because the subtag 'a' appears
        twice.  Note that the tag "en-a-bbb-x-a-ccc" is valid because
        the second appearance of the singleton 'a' is in a private use
        sequence.

   5.   Extension subtags MUST meet all of the requirements for the
        content and format of subtags defined in this document.

   6.   Extension subtags MUST meet whatever requirements are set by the
        document that defines their singleton prefix and whatever
        requirements are provided by the maintaining authority.

   7.   Each extension subtag MUST be from two to eight characters long
        and consist solely of letters or digits, with each subtag
        separated by a single '-'.

   8.   Each singleton MUST be followed by at least one extension
        subtag.  For example, the tag "tlh-a-b-foo" is invalid because
        the first singleton 'a' is followed immediately by another
        singleton 'b'.

   9.   Extension subtags MUST follow all language, extended language,
        script, region, and variant subtags in a tag.

   10.  All subtags following the singleton and before another singleton
        are part of the extension.  Example: In the tag "fr-a-Latn", the
        subtag 'Latn' does not represent the script subtag 'Latn'
        defined in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.  Its meaning is
        defined by the extension 'a'.

   11.  In the event that more than one extension appears in a single
        tag, the tag SHOULD be canonicalized as described in
        <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>.

   For example, if the prefix singleton 'r' and the shown subtags were
   defined, then the following tag would be a valid example:
   "en-Latn-GB-boont-r-extended-sequence-x-private".

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.7.%20%20Private%20Use%20Subtags"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.7" name="section-2.2.7">2.2.7</a>.  Private Use Subtags</span>

   Private use subtags are used to indicate distinctions in language
   important in a given context by private agreement.  The following
   rules apply to private use subtags:

   1.  Private use subtags are separated from the other subtags defined
       in this document by the reserved single-character subtag 'x'.

   2.  Private use subtags MUST conform to the format and content
       constraints defined in the ABNF for all subtags.

   3.  Private use subtags MUST follow all language, extended language,
       script, region, variant, and extension subtags in the tag.
       Another way of saying this is that all subtags following the
       singleton 'x' MUST be considered private use.  Example: The
       subtag 'US' in the tag "en-x-US" is a private use subtag.

   4.  A tag MAY consist entirely of private use subtags.

   5.  No source is defined for private use subtags.  Use of private use
       subtags is by private agreement only.

   6.  Private use subtags are NOT RECOMMENDED where alternatives exist
       or for general interchange.  See <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a> for more information
       on private use subtag choice.

   For example: Users who wished to utilize codes from the Ethnologue
   publication of SIL International for language identification might
   agree to exchange tags such as "az-Arab-x-AZE-derbend".  This example
   contains two private use subtags.  The first is 'AZE' and the second
   is 'derbend'.

   Existing IANA-registered language tags from <a href="rfc1766.html">RFC 1766</a> and/or <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a>
   maintain their validity.  These tags will be maintained in the
   registry in records of either the "grandfathered" or "redundant"
   type.  Grandfathered tags contain one or more subtags that are not
   defined in the Language Subtag Registry (see <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).  Redundant
   tags consist entirely of subtags defined above and whose independent
   registration is superseded by this document.  For more information,
   see <a href="#section-3.8">Section 3.8</a>.

   It is important to note that all language tags formed under the
   guidelines in this document were either legal, well-formed tags or
   could have been registered under <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.9.%20%20Classes%20of%20Conformance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.9" name="section-2.2.9">2.2.9</a>.  Classes of Conformance</span>

   Implementations sometimes need to describe their capabilities with
   regard to the rules and practices described in this document.  There
   are two classes of conforming implementations described by this
   document: "well-formed" processors and "validating" processors.
   Claims of conformance SHOULD explicitly reference one of these
   definitions.

   An implementation that claims to check for well-formed language tags
   MUST:

   o  Check that the tag and all of its subtags, including extension and
      private use subtags, conform to the ABNF or that the tag is on the
      list of grandfathered tags.

   o  Check that singleton subtags that identify extensions do not
      repeat.  For example, the tag "en-a-xx-b-yy-a-zz" is not well-
      formed.

   Well-formed processors are strongly encouraged to implement the
   canonicalization rules contained in <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>.

   An implementation that claims to be validating MUST:

   o  Check that the tag is well-formed.

   o  Specify the particular registry date for which the implementation
      performs validation of subtags.

   o  Check that either the tag is a grandfathered tag, or that all
      language, script, region, and variant subtags consist of valid
      codes for use in language tags according to the IANA registry as
      of the particular date specified by the implementation.

   o  Specify which, if any, extension RFCs as defined in <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>
      are supported, including version, revision, and date.

   o  For any such extensions supported, check that all subtags used in
      that extension are valid.

   o  For variant and extended language subtags, if the registry
      contains one or more 'Prefix' fields for that subtag, check that
      the tag matches at least one prefix.  The tag matches if all the

      subtags in the 'Prefix' also appear in the tag.  For example, the
      prefix "es-CO" matches the tag "es-Latn-CO-x-private" because both
      the 'es' language subtag and 'CO' region subtag appear in the tag.

   This section defines the Language Subtag Registry and the maintenance
   and update procedures associated with it, as well as a registry for
   extensions to language tags (<a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>).

   The Language Subtag Registry contains a comprehensive list of all of
   the subtags valid in language tags.  This allows implementers a
   straightforward and reliable way to validate language tags.  The
   Language Subtag Registry will be maintained so that, except for
   extension subtags, it is possible to validate all of the subtags that
   appear in a language tag under the provisions of this document or its
   revisions or successors.  In addition, the meaning of the various
   subtags will be unambiguous and stable over time.  (The meaning of
   private use subtags, of course, is not defined by the IANA registry.)

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Format%20of%20the%20IANA%20Language%20Subtag%20Registry"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Format of the IANA Language Subtag Registry</span>

   The IANA Language Subtag Registry ("the registry") consists of a text
   file that is machine readable in the format described in this
   section, plus copies of the registration forms approved in accordance
   with the process described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.  The existing registration
   forms for grandfathered and redundant tags taken from <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> will
   be maintained as part of the obsolete <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> registry.  The
   remaining set of initial subtags will not have registration forms
   created for them.

   The registry is in the text format described below.  This format was
   based on the record-jar format described in [<a href="#ref-record-jar" title='"The Art of Unix Programming"'>record-jar</a>].

   Each line of text is limited to 72 characters, including all
   whitespace.  Records are separated by lines containing only the
   sequence "%%" (%x25.25).

   Each field can be viewed as a single, logical line of ASCII
   characters, comprising a field-name and a field-body separated by a
   COLON character (%x3A).  For convenience, the field-body portion of
   this conceptual entity can be split into a multiple-line
   representation; this is called "folding".  The format of the registry
   is described by the following ABNF (per [<a href="rfc4234.html" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC4234</a>]):

                      Figure 2: Registry Format ABNF

   The sequence '..' (%x2E.2E) in a field-body denotes a range of
   values.  Such a range represents all subtags of the same length that
   are in alphabetic or numeric order within that range, including the
   values explicitly mentioned.  For example 'a..c' denotes the values
   'a', 'b', and 'c' and '11..13' denotes the values '11', '12', and
   '13'.

   Characters from outside the US-ASCII [<a href="#ref-ISO646" title='"ISO/IEC 646:1991, Information technology -- ISO 7-bit coded character set for information interchange."'>ISO646</a>] repertoire, as well as
   the AMPERSAND character ("&amp;", %x26) when it occurs in a field-body,
   are represented by a "Numeric Character Reference" using hexadecimal
   notation in the style used by [<a href="#ref-XML10" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0"'>XML10</a>] (see
   &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#dt-charref">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#dt-charref</a>&gt;).  This consists of the
   sequence "&amp;#x" (%x26.23.78) followed by a hexadecimal representation
   of the character's code point in [<a href="#ref-ISO10646" title='"ISO/IEC 10646:2003. Information technology -- Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set (UCS)"'>ISO10646</a>] followed by a closing
   semicolon (%x3B).  For example, the EURO SIGN, U+20AC, would be
   represented by the sequence "&amp;#x20AC;".  Note that the hexadecimal
   notation MAY have between two and six digits.

   All fields whose field-body contains a date value use the "full-date"
   format specified in [<a href="rfc3339.html" title='"Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps"'>RFC3339</a>].  For example: "2004-06-28" represents
   June 28, 2004, in the Gregorian calendar.

   The first record in the file contains the single field whose field-
   name is "File-Date" (see Figure 3).  The field-body of this record
   contains the last modification date of this copy of the registry,
   making it possible to compare different versions of the registry.
   The registry on the IANA website is the most current.  Versions with
   an older date than that one are not up-to-date.

   Subsequent records represent subtags in the registry.  Each of the
   fields in each record MUST occur no more than once, unless otherwise
   noted below.  Each record MUST contain the following fields:

   o  'Type'

      *  Type's field-value MUST consist of one of the following
         strings: "language", "extlang", "script", "region", "variant",
         "grandfathered", and "redundant" and denotes the type of tag or
         subtag.

   o  Either 'Subtag' or 'Tag'

      *  Subtag's field-value contains the subtag being defined.  This
         field MUST only appear in records of whose 'Type' has one of
         these values: "language", "extlang", "script", "region", or
         "variant".

      *  Tag's field-value contains a complete language tag.  This field
         MUST only appear in records whose 'Type' has one of these
         values: "grandfathered" or "redundant".  Note that the field-
         value will always follow the 'grandfathered' production in the
         ABNF in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>

   o  Description

      *  Description's field-value contains a non-normative description
         of the subtag or tag.

   o  Added

      *  Added's field-value contains the date the record was added to
         the registry.

   The 'Subtag' or 'Tag' field MUST use lowercase letters to form the
   subtag or tag, with two exceptions.  Subtags whose 'Type' field is
   'script' (in other words, subtags defined by ISO 15924) MUST use
   titlecase.  Subtags whose 'Type' field is 'region' (in other words,
   subtags defined by ISO 3166) MUST use uppercase.  These exceptions
   mirror the use of case in the underlying standards.

   The field 'Description' MAY appear more than one time and contains a
   description of the tag or subtag in the record.  At least one of the
   'Description' fields MUST be written or transcribed into the Latin
   script; the same or additional fields MAY also include a description
   in a non-Latin script.  The 'Description' field is used for
   identification purposes and SHOULD NOT be taken to represent the
   actual native name of the language or variation or to be in any
   particular language.  Most descriptions are taken directly from
   source standards such as ISO 639 or ISO 3166.

   Note: Descriptions in registry entries that correspond to ISO 639,
   ISO 15924, ISO 3166, or UN M.49 codes are intended only to indicate
   the meaning of that identifier as defined in the source standard at
   the time it was added to the registry.  The description does not
   replace the content of the source standard itself.  The descriptions
   are not intended to be the English localized names for the subtags.
   Localization or translation of language tag and subtag descriptions
   is out of scope of this document.

   Each record MAY also contain the following fields:

   o  Preferred-Value

      *  For fields of type 'language', 'extlang', 'script', 'region',
         and 'variant', 'Preferred-Value' contains the subtag of the
         same 'Type' that is preferred for forming the language tag.

      *  For fields of type 'grandfathered' and 'redundant', a canonical
         mapping to a complete language tag.

   o  Deprecated

      *  Deprecated's field-value contains the date the record was
         deprecated.

   o  Prefix

      *  Prefix's field-value contains a language tag with which this
         subtag MAY be used to form a new language tag, perhaps with
         other subtags as well.  This field MUST only appear in records
         whose 'Type' field-value is 'variant' or 'extlang'.  For
         example, the 'Prefix' for the variant 'nedis' is 'sl', meaning
         that the tags "sl-nedis" and "sl-IT-nedis" might be appropriate
         while the tag "is-nedis" is not.

   o  Comments

      *  Comments contains additional information about the subtag, as
         deemed appropriate for understanding the registry and
         implementing language tags using the subtag or tag.

   o  Suppress-Script

      *  Suppress-Script contains a script subtag that SHOULD NOT be
         used to form language tags with the associated primary language
         subtag.  This field MUST only appear in records whose 'Type'
         field-value is 'language'.  See <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   The field 'Deprecated' MAY be added to any record via the maintenance
   process described in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> or via the registration process
   described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.  Usually, the addition of a 'Deprecated'
   field is due to the action of one of the standards bodies, such as
   ISO 3166, withdrawing a code.  In some historical cases, it might not
   have been possible to reconstruct the original deprecation date.  For
   these cases, an approximate date appears in the registry.  Although
   valid in language tags, subtags and tags with a 'Deprecated' field
   are deprecated and validating processors SHOULD NOT generate these
   subtags.  Note that a record that contains a 'Deprecated' field and
   no corresponding 'Preferred-Value' field has no replacement mapping.

   The field 'Preferred-Value' contains a mapping between the record in
   which it appears and another tag or subtag.  The value in this field
   is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED as the best choice to represent the value of
   this record when selecting a language tag.  These values form three
   groups:

   1.  ISO 639 language codes that were later withdrawn in favor of
       other codes.  These values are mostly a historical curiosity.

   2.  ISO 3166 region codes that have been withdrawn in favor of a new
       code.  This sometimes happens when a country changes its name or
       administration in such a way that warrants a new region code.

   3.  Tags grandfathered from <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a>.  In many cases, these tags have
       become obsolete because the values they represent were later
       encoded by ISO 639.

   Records that contain a 'Preferred-Value' field MUST also have a
   'Deprecated' field.  This field contains a date of deprecation.
   Thus, a language tag processor can use the registry to construct the
   valid, non-deprecated set of subtags for a given date.  In addition,
   for any given tag, a processor can construct the set of valid
   language tags that correspond to that tag for all dates up to the
   date of the registry.  The ability to do these mappings MAY be
   beneficial to applications that are matching, selecting, for
   filtering content based on its language tags.

   Note that 'Preferred-Value' mappings in records of type 'region'
   sometimes do not represent exactly the same meaning as the original
   value.  There are many reasons for a country code to be changed, and
   the effect this has on the formation of language tags will depend on
   the nature of the change in question.

   In particular, the 'Preferred-Value' field does not imply retagging
   content that uses the affected subtag.

   The field 'Preferred-Value' MUST NOT be modified once created in the
   registry.  The field MAY be added to records of type "grandfathered"
   and "region" according to the rules in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.  Otherwise the
   field MUST NOT be added to any record already in the registry.

   The 'Preferred-Value' field in records of type "grandfathered" and
   "redundant" contains whole language tags that are strongly
   RECOMMENDED for use in place of the record's value.  In many cases,
   the mappings were created by deprecation of the tags during the
   period before this document was adopted.  For example, the tag
   "no-nyn" was deprecated in favor of the ISO 639-1-defined language
   code 'nn'.

   Records of type 'variant' MAY have more than one field of type
   'Prefix'.  Additional fields of this type MAY be added to a 'variant'
   record via the registration process.

   Records of type 'extlang' MUST have _exactly_ one 'Prefix' field.

   The field-value of the 'Prefix' field consists of a language tag
   whose subtags are appropriate to use with this subtag.  For example,
   the variant subtag '1996' has a 'Prefix' field of "de".  This means
   that tags starting with the sequence "de-" are appropriate with this
   subtag, so "de-Latg-1996" and "de-CH-1996" are both acceptable, while
   the tag "fr-1996" is an inappropriate choice.

   The field of type 'Prefix' MUST NOT be removed from any record.  The
   field-value for this type of field MUST NOT be modified.

   The field 'Comments' MAY appear more than once per record.  This
   field MAY be inserted or changed via the registration process and no
   guarantee of stability is provided.  The content of this field is not
   restricted, except by the need to register the information, the
   suitability of the request, and by reasonable practical size
   limitations.

   The field 'Suppress-Script' MUST only appear in records whose 'Type'
   field-value is 'language'.  This field MUST NOT appear more than one
   time in a record.  This field indicates a script used to write the
   overwhelming majority of documents for the given language and that
   therefore adds no distinguishing information to a language tag.  It
   helps ensure greater compatibility between the language tags
   generated according to the rules in this document and language tags
   and tag processors or consumers based on <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a>.  For example,
   virtually all Icelandic documents are written in the Latin script,
   making the subtag 'Latn' redundant in the tag "is-Latn".

   The Language Subtag Reviewer is appointed by the IESG for an
   indefinite term, subject to removal or replacement at the IESG's
   discretion.  The Language Subtag Reviewer moderates the ietf-
   languages mailing list, responds to requests for registration, and
   performs the other registry maintenance duties described in
   <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.  Only the Language Subtag Reviewer is permitted to
   request IANA to change, update, or add records to the Language Subtag
   Registry.

   The performance or decisions of the Language Subtag Reviewer MAY be
   appealed to the IESG under the same rules as other IETF decisions
   (see [<a href="rfc2026.html" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>]).  The IESG can reverse or overturn the decision of
   the Language Subtag Reviewer, provide guidance, or take other
   appropriate actions.

   Maintenance of the registry requires that as codes are assigned or
   withdrawn by ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166, and UN M.49, the Language
   Subtag Reviewer MUST evaluate each change, determine whether it
   conflicts with existing registry entries, and submit the information
   to IANA for inclusion in the registry.  If a change takes place and
   the Language Subtag Reviewer does not do this in a timely manner,
   then any interested party MAY use the procedure in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a> to
   register the appropriate update.

   Note: The redundant and grandfathered entries together are the
   complete list of tags registered under [<a href="rfc3066.html" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>RFC3066</a>].  The redundant tags
   are those that can now be formed using the subtags defined in the
   registry together with the rules of <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>.  The grandfathered
   entries include those that can never be legal under those same
   provisions.

   The set of redundant and grandfathered tags is permanent and stable:
   new entries in this section MUST NOT be added and existing entries
   MUST NOT be removed.  Records of type 'grandfathered' MAY have their
   type converted to 'redundant'; see item 12 in <a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a> for more
   information.  The decision-making process about which tags were
   initially grandfathered and which were made redundant is described in
   [<a href="rfc4645.html" title='"Initial Language Subtag Registry"'>RFC4645</a>].

   <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> tags that were deprecated prior to the adoption of this
   document are part of the list of grandfathered tags, and their
   component subtags were not included as registered variants (although
   they remain eligible for registration).  For example, the tag
   "art-lojban" was deprecated in favor of the language subtag 'jbo'.

   The Language Subtag Reviewer MUST ensure that new subtags meet the
   requirements in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a> or submit an appropriate alternate subtag
   as described in that section.  When either a change or addition to
   the registry is needed, the Language Subtag Reviewer MUST prepare the
   complete record, including all fields, and forward it to IANA for
   insertion into the registry.  Each record being modified or inserted
   MUST be forwarded in a separate message.

   If a record represents a new subtag that does not currently exist in
   the registry, then the message's subject line MUST include the word
   "INSERT".  If the record represents a change to an existing subtag,
   then the subject line of the message MUST include the word "MODIFY".
   The message MUST contain both the record for the subtag being
   inserted or modified and the new File-Date record.  Here is an
   example of what the body of the message might contain:

   LANGUAGE SUBTAG MODIFICATION
   File-Date: 2005-01-02
   %%
   Type: variant
   Subtag: nedis
   Description: Natisone dialect

   Prefix: sl
   Comments: This is a comment shown
     as an example.
   %%

         Figure 4: Example of a Language Subtag Modification Form

   Whenever an entry is created or modified in the registry, the
   'File-Date' record at the start of the registry is updated to reflect
   the most recent modification date in the [<a href="rfc3339.html" title='"Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps"'>RFC3339</a>] "full-date"
   format.

   Before forwarding a new registration to IANA, the Language Subtag
   Reviewer MUST ensure that values in the 'Subtag' field match case
   according to the description in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.

   The stability of entries and their meaning in the registry is
   critical to the long-term stability of language tags.  The rules in
   this section guarantee that a specific language tag's meaning is
   stable over time and will not change.

   These rules specifically deal with how changes to codes (including
   withdrawal and deprecation of codes) maintained by ISO 639, ISO
   15924, ISO 3166, and UN M.49 are reflected in the IANA Language
   Subtag Registry.  Assignments to the IANA Language Subtag Registry
   MUST follow the following stability rules:

   1.   Values in the fields 'Type', 'Subtag', 'Tag', 'Added',
        'Deprecated' and 'Preferred-Value' MUST NOT be changed and are
        guaranteed to be stable over time.

   2.   Values in the 'Description' field MUST NOT be changed in a way
        that would invalidate previously-existing tags.  They MAY be
        broadened somewhat in scope, changed to add information, or
        adapted to the most common modern usage.  For example, countries
        occasionally change their official names; a historical example
        of this would be "Upper Volta" changing to "Burkina Faso".

   3.   Values in the field 'Prefix' MAY be added to records of type
        'variant' via the registration process.

   4.   Values in the field 'Prefix' MAY be modified, so long as the
        modifications broaden the set of prefixes.  That is, a prefix
        MAY be replaced by one of its own prefixes.  For example, the
        prefix "en-US" could be replaced by "en", but not by the
        prefixes "en-Latn", "fr", or "en-US-boont".  If one of those
        prefixes were needed, a new Prefix SHOULD be registered.

   5.   Values in the field 'Prefix' MUST NOT be removed.

   6.   The field 'Comments' MAY be added, changed, modified, or removed
        via the registration process or any of the processes or
        considerations described in this section.

   7.   The field 'Suppress-Script' MAY be added or removed via the
        registration process.

   8.   Codes assigned by ISO 639, ISO 15924, and ISO 3166 that do not
        conflict with existing subtags of the associated type and whose
        meaning is not the same as an existing subtag of the same type
        are entered into the IANA registry as new records.

   9.   Codes assigned by ISO 639, ISO 15924, or ISO 3166 that are
        withdrawn by their respective maintenance or registration
        authority remain valid in language tags.  A 'Deprecated' field
        containing the date of withdrawal is added to the record.  If a
        new record of the same type is added that represents a

        replacement value, then a 'Preferred-Value' field MAY also be
        added.  The registration process MAY be used to add comments
        about the withdrawal of the code by the respective standard.

        Example
           The region code 'TL' was assigned to the country 'Timor-
           Leste', replacing the code 'TP' (which was assigned to 'East
           Timor' when it was under administration by Portugal).  The
           subtag 'TP' remains valid in language tags, but its record
           contains the a 'Preferred-Value' of 'TL' and its field
           'Deprecated' contains the date the new code was assigned
           ('2004-07-06').

   10.  Codes assigned by ISO 639, ISO 15924, or ISO 3166 that conflict
        with existing subtags of the associated type, including subtags
        that are deprecated, MUST NOT be entered into the registry.  The
        following additional considerations apply to subtag values that
        are reassigned:

        A.  For ISO 639 codes, if the newly assigned code's meaning is
            not represented by a subtag in the IANA registry, the
            Language Subtag Reviewer, as described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>, SHALL
            prepare a proposal for entering in the IANA registry as soon
            as practical a registered language subtag as an alternate
            value for the new code.  The form of the registered language
            subtag will be at the discretion of the Language Subtag
            Reviewer and MUST conform to other restrictions on language
            subtags in this document.

        B.  For all subtags whose meaning is derived from an external
            standard (i.e., ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166, or UN M.49),
            if a new meaning is assigned to an existing code and the new
            meaning broadens the meaning of that code, then the meaning
            for the associated subtag MAY be changed to match.  The
            meaning of a subtag MUST NOT be narrowed, however, as this
            can result in an unknown proportion of the existing uses of
            a subtag becoming invalid.  Note: ISO 639 maintenance
            agency/registration authority (MA/RA) has adopted a similar
            stability policy.

        C.  For ISO 15924 codes, if the newly assigned code's meaning is
            not represented by a subtag in the IANA registry, the
            Language Subtag Reviewer, as described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>, SHALL
            prepare a proposal for entering in the IANA registry as soon
            as practical a registered variant subtag as an alternate
            value for the new code.  The form of the registered variant

            subtag will be at the discretion of the Language Subtag
            Reviewer and MUST conform to other restrictions on variant
            subtags in this document.

        D.  For ISO 3166 codes, if the newly assigned code's meaning is
            associated with the same UN M.49 code as another 'region'
            subtag, then the existing region subtag remains as the
            preferred value for that region and no new entry is created.
            A comment MAY be added to the existing region subtag
            indicating the relationship to the new ISO 3166 code.

        E.  For ISO 3166 codes, if the newly assigned code's meaning is
            associated with a UN M.49 code that is not represented by an
            existing region subtag, then the Language Subtag Reviewer,
            as described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>, SHALL prepare a proposal for
            entering the appropriate UN M.49 country code as an entry in
            the IANA registry.

        F.  For ISO 3166 codes, if there is no associated UN numeric
            code, then the Language Subtag Reviewer SHALL petition the
            UN to create one.  If there is no response from the UN
            within ninety days of the request being sent, the Language
            Subtag Reviewer SHALL prepare a proposal for entering in the
            IANA registry as soon as practical a registered variant
            subtag as an alternate value for the new code.  The form of
            the registered variant subtag will be at the discretion of
            the Language Subtag Reviewer and MUST conform to other
            restrictions on variant subtags in this document.  This
            situation is very unlikely to ever occur.

   11.  UN M.49 has codes for both countries and areas (such as '276'
        for Germany) and geographical regions and sub-regions (such as
        '150' for Europe).  UN M.49 country or area codes for which
        there is no corresponding ISO 3166 code SHOULD NOT be
        registered, except as a surrogate for an ISO 3166 code that is
        blocked from registration by an existing subtag.  If such a code
        becomes necessary, then the registration authority for ISO 3166
        SHOULD first be petitioned to assign a code to the region.  If
        the petition for a code assignment by ISO 3166 is refused or not
        acted on in a timely manner, the registration process described
        in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a> MAY then be used to register the corresponding UN
        M.49 code.  At the time this document was written, there were
        only four such codes: 830 (Channel Islands), 831 (Guernsey), 832
        (Jersey), and 833 (Isle of Man).  This way, UN M.49 codes remain
        available as the value of last resort in cases where ISO 3166
        reassigns a deprecated value in the registry.

   12.  Stability provisions apply to grandfathered tags with this
        exception: should all of the subtags in a grandfathered tag
        become valid subtags in the IANA registry, then the field 'Type'
        in that record is changed from 'grandfathered' to 'redundant'.
        Note that this will not affect language tags that match the
        grandfathered tag, since these tags will now match valid
        generative subtag sequences.  For example, if the subtag 'gan'
        in the language tag "zh-gan" were to be registered as an
        extended language subtag, then the grandfathered tag "zh-gan"
        would be deprecated (but existing content or implementations
        that use "zh-gan" would remain valid).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.5.%20%20Registration%20Procedure%20for%20Subtags"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" name="section-3.5">3.5</a>.  Registration Procedure for Subtags</span>

   The procedure given here MUST be used by anyone who wants to use a
   subtag not currently in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.

   Only subtags of type 'language' and 'variant' will be considered for
   independent registration of new subtags.  Handling of subtags needed
   for stability and subtags necessary to keep the registry synchronized
   with ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166, and UN M.49 within the limits
   defined by this document are described in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.  Stability
   provisions are described in <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.

   This procedure MAY also be used to register or alter the information
   for the 'Description', 'Comments', 'Deprecated', or 'Prefix' fields
   in a subtag's record as described in <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.  Changes to all
   other fields in the IANA registry are NOT permitted.

   Registering a new subtag or requesting modifications to an existing
   tag or subtag starts with the requester filling out the registration
   form reproduced below.  Note that each response is not limited in
   size so that the request can adequately describe the registration.
   The fields in the "Record Requested" section SHOULD follow the
   requirements in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.

      of the language (book or article):
   6. Any other relevant information:

              Figure 5: The Language Subtag Registration Form

   The subtag registration form MUST be sent to
   &lt;ietf-languages@iana.org&gt; for a two-week review period before it can
   be submitted to IANA.  (This is an open list and can be joined by
   sending a request to &lt;ietf-languages-request@iana.org&gt;.)

   Variant subtags are usually registered for use with a particular
   range of language tags.  For example, the subtag 'rozaj' is intended
   for use with language tags that start with the primary language
   subtag "sl", since Resian is a dialect of Slovenian.  Thus, the
   subtag 'rozaj' would be appropriate in tags such as "sl-Latn-rozaj"
   or "sl-IT-rozaj".  This information is stored in the 'Prefix' field
   in the registry.  Variant registration requests SHOULD include at
   least one 'Prefix' field in the registration form.

   Extended language subtags are reserved for future standardization.
   These subtags will be REQUIRED to include exactly one 'Prefix' field
   once they are allowed for registration.

   The 'Prefix' field for a given registered subtag exists in the IANA
   registry as a guide to usage.  Additional prefixes MAY be added by
   filing an additional registration form.  In that form, the "Any other
   relevant information:" field MUST indicate that it is the addition of
   a prefix.

   Requests to add a prefix to a variant subtag that imply a different
   semantic meaning will probably be rejected.  For example, a request
   to add the prefix "de" to the subtag 'nedis' so that the tag



<span class="grey">Phillips &amp; Davis         Best Current Practice                 [Page 30]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-31" id="page-31" name="page-31"> </a>

   "de-nedis" represented some German dialect would be rejected.  The
   'nedis' subtag represents a particular Slovenian dialect and the
   additional registration would change the semantic meaning assigned to
   the subtag.  A separate subtag SHOULD be proposed instead.

   The 'Description' field MUST contain a description of the tag being
   registered written or transcribed into the Latin script; it MAY also
   include a description in a non-Latin script.  Non-ASCII characters
   MUST be escaped using the syntax described in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.  The
   'Description' field is used for identification purposes and doesn't
   necessarily represent the actual native name of the language or
   variation or to be in any particular language.

   While the 'Description' field itself is not guaranteed to be stable
   and errata corrections MAY be undertaken from time to time, attempts
   to provide translations or transcriptions of entries in the registry
   itself will probably be frowned upon by the community or rejected
   outright, as changes of this nature have an impact on the provisions
   in <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.

   When the two-week period has passed, the Language Subtag Reviewer
   either forwards the record to be inserted or modified to
   iana@iana.org according to the procedure described in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>, or
   rejects the request because of significant objections raised on the
   list or due to problems with constraints in this document (which MUST
   be explicitly cited).  The Language Subtag Reviewer MAY also extend
   the review period in two-week increments to permit further
   discussion.  The Language Subtag Reviewer MUST indicate on the list
   whether the registration has been accepted, rejected, or extended
   following each two-week period.

   Note that the Language Subtag Reviewer MAY raise objections on the
   list if he or she so desires.  The important thing is that the
   objection MUST be made publicly.

   The applicant is free to modify a rejected application with
   additional information and submit it again; this restarts the two-
   week comment period.

   Decisions made by the Language Subtag Reviewer MAY be appealed to the
   IESG [<a href="rfc2028.html" title='"The Organizations Involved in the IETF Standards Process"'>RFC2028</a>] under the same rules as other IETF decisions
   [<a href="rfc2026.html" title='"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3"'>RFC2026</a>].

   All approved registration forms are available online in the directory
   <a href="http://www.iana.org/numbers.html">http://www.iana.org/numbers.html</a> under "languages".

   Updates or changes to existing records follow the same procedure as
   new registrations.  The Language Subtag Reviewer decides whether
   there is consensus to update the registration following the two-week
   review period; normally, objections by the original registrant will
   carry extra weight in forming such a consensus.

   Registrations are permanent and stable.  Once registered, subtags
   will not be removed from the registry and will remain a valid way in
   which to specify a specific language or variant.

   Note: The purpose of the "Description" in the registration form is to
   aid people trying to verify whether a language is registered or what
   language or language variation a particular subtag refers to.  In
   most cases, reference to an authoritative grammar or dictionary of
   that language will be useful; in cases where no such work exists,
   other well-known works describing that language or in that language
   MAY be appropriate.  The Language Subtag Reviewer decides what
   constitutes "good enough" reference material.  This requirement is
   not intended to exclude particular languages or dialects due to the
   size of the speaker population or lack of a standardized orthography.
   Minority languages will be considered equally on their own merits.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.6.%20%20Possibilities%20for%20Registration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6" name="section-3.6">3.6</a>.  Possibilities for Registration</span>

   Possibilities for registration of subtags or information about
   subtags include:

   o  Primary language subtags for languages not listed in ISO 639 that
      are not variants of any listed or registered language MAY be
      registered.  At the time this document was created, there were no
      examples of this form of subtag.  Before attempting to register a
      language subtag, there MUST be an attempt to register the language
      with ISO 639.  Subtags MUST NOT be registered for codes that exist
      in ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2, that are under consideration by the ISO
      639 maintenance or registration authorities, or that have never
      been attempted for registration with those authorities.  If ISO
      639 has previously rejected a language for registration, it is
      reasonable to assume that there must be additional, very
      compelling evidence of need before it will be registered in the
      IANA registry (to the extent that it is very unlikely that any
      subtags will be registered of this type).

   o  Dialect or other divisions or variations within a language, its
      orthography, writing system, regional or historical usage,
      transliteration or other transformation, or distinguishing
      variation MAY be registered as variant subtags.  An example is the
      'rozaj' subtag (the Resian dialect of Slovenian).

   o  The addition or maintenance of fields (generally of an
      informational nature) in Tag or Subtag records as described in
      <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> and subject to the stability provisions in
      <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.  This includes descriptions, comments, deprecation
      and preferred values for obsolete or withdrawn codes, or the
      addition of script or extlang information to primary language
      subtags.

   o  The addition of records and related field value changes necessary
      to reflect assignments made by ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166, and
      UN M.49 as described in <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.

   Subtags proposed for registration that would cause all or part of a
   grandfathered tag to become redundant but whose meaning conflicts
   with or alters the meaning of the grandfathered tag MUST be rejected.

   This document leaves the decision on what subtags or changes to
   subtags are appropriate (or not) to the registration process
   described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.

   Note: four-character primary language subtags are reserved to allow
   for the possibility of alpha4 codes in some future addition to the
   ISO 639 family of standards.

   Extension subtags are those introduced by single-character subtags
   ("singletons") other than 'x'.  They are reserved for the generation
   of identifiers that contain a language component and are compatible
   with applications that understand language tags.

   The structure and form of extensions are defined by this document so
   that implementations can be created that are forward compatible with
   applications that might be created using singletons in the future.
   In addition, defining a mechanism for maintaining singletons will
   lend stability to this document by reducing the likely need for
   future revisions or updates.

   Single-character subtags are assigned by IANA using the "IETF
   Consensus" policy defined by [<a href="rfc2434.html" title='"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"'>RFC2434</a>].  This policy requires the
   development of an RFC, which SHALL define the name, purpose,
   processes, and procedures for maintaining the subtags.  The
   maintaining or registering authority, including name, contact email,

   discussion list email, and URL location of the registry, MUST be
   indicated clearly in the RFC.  The RFC MUST specify or include each
   of the following:

   o  The specification MUST reference the specific version or revision
      of this document that governs its creation and MUST reference this
      section of this document.

   o  The specification and all subtags defined by the specification
      MUST follow the ABNF and other rules for the formation of tags and
      subtags as defined in this document.  In particular, it MUST
      specify that case is not significant and that subtags MUST NOT
      exceed eight characters in length.

   o  The specification MUST specify a canonical representation.

   o  The specification of valid subtags MUST be available over the
      Internet and at no cost.

   o  The specification MUST be in the public domain or available via a
      royalty-free license acceptable to the IETF and specified in the
      RFC.

   o  The specification MUST be versioned, and each version of the
      specification MUST be numbered, dated, and stable.

   o  The specification MUST be stable.  That is, extension subtags,
      once defined by a specification, MUST NOT be retracted or change
      in meaning in any substantial way.

   o  The specification MUST include in a separate section the
      registration form reproduced in this section (below) to be used in
      registering the extension upon publication as an RFC.

   o  IANA MUST be informed of changes to the contact information and
      URL for the specification.

   IANA will maintain a registry of allocated single-character
   (singleton) subtags.  This registry MUST use the record-jar format
   described by the ABNF in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.  Upon publication of an
   extension as an RFC, the maintaining authority defined in the RFC
   MUST forward this registration form to iesg@ietf.org, who MUST
   forward the request to iana@iana.org.  The maintaining authority of
   the extension MUST maintain the accuracy of the record by sending an
   updated full copy of the record to iana@iana.org with the subject
   line "LANGUAGE TAG EXTENSION UPDATE" whenever content changes.  Only
   the 'Comments', 'Contact_Email', 'Mailing_List', and 'URL' fields MAY
   be modified in these updates.

   The determination of whether an Internet-Draft meets the above
   conditions and the decision to grant or withhold such authority rests
   solely with the IESG and is subject to the normal review and appeals
   process associated with the RFC process.

   Extension authors are strongly cautioned that many (including most
   well-formed) processors will be unaware of any special relationships
   or meaning inherent in the order of extension subtags.  Extension
   authors SHOULD avoid subtag relationships or canonicalization
   mechanisms that interfere with matching or with length restrictions
   that sometimes exist in common protocols where the extension is used.
   In particular, applications MAY truncate the subtags in doing
   matching or in fitting into limited lengths, so it is RECOMMENDED
   that the most significant information be in the most significant
   (left-most) subtags and that the specification gracefully handle
   truncated subtags.

   When a language tag is to be used in a specific, known, protocol, it
   is RECOMMENDED that the language tag not contain extensions not
   supported by that protocol.  In addition, note that some protocols
   MAY impose upper limits on the length of the strings used to store or
   transport the language tag.

   Upon adoption of this document, an initial version of the Language
   Subtag Registry containing the various subtags initially valid in a
   language tag is necessary.  This collection of subtags, along with a
   description of the process used to create it, is described by
   [<a href="rfc4645.html" title='"Initial Language Subtag Registry"'>RFC4645</a>].  IANA SHALL publish the initial version of the registry
   described by this document from the content of [<a href="rfc4645.html" title='"Initial Language Subtag Registry"'>RFC4645</a>].  Once
   published by IANA, the maintenance procedures, rules, and
   registration processes described in this document will be available
   for new registrations or updates.

   Registrations that are in process under the rules defined in
   [<a href="rfc3066.html" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>RFC3066</a>] when this document is adopted MAY be completed under the
   former rules, at the discretion of the Language Tag Reviewer (as
   described in [<a href="rfc3066.html" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>RFC3066</a>]).  Until the IESG officially appoints a
   Language Subtag Reviewer, the existing Language Tag Reviewer SHALL
   serve as the Language Subtag Reviewer.

   Any new registrations submitted using the <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> forms or format
   after the adoption of this document and publication of the registry
   by IANA MUST be rejected.

   An initial version of the Language Tag Extensions Registry described
   in <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a> is also needed.  The Language Tag Extensions Registry
   SHALL be initialized with a single record containing a single field
   of type "File-Date" as a placeholder for future assignments.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Formation%20and%20Processing%20of%20Language%20Tags"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Formation and Processing of Language Tags</span>

   This section addresses how to use the information in the registry
   with the tag syntax to choose, form, and process language tags.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Choice%20of%20Language%20Tag"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Choice of Language Tag</span>

   One is sometimes faced with the choice between several possible tags
   for the same body of text.

   Interoperability is best served when all users use the same language
   tag in order to represent the same language.  If an application has
   requirements that make the rules here inapplicable, then that
   application risks damaging interoperability.  It is strongly
   RECOMMENDED that users not define their own rules for language tag
   choice.

   Subtags SHOULD only be used where they add useful distinguishing
   information; extraneous subtags interfere with the meaning,
   understanding, and processing of language tags.  In particular, users
   and implementations SHOULD follow the 'Prefix' and 'Suppress-Script'
   fields in the registry (defined in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>): these fields provide
   guidance on when specific additional subtags SHOULD (and SHOULD NOT)
   be used in a language tag.

   Of particular note, many applications can benefit from the use of
   script subtags in language tags, as long as the use is consistent for
   a given context.  Script subtags were not formally defined in <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc3066.html">3066</a> and their use can affect matching and subtag identification by
   implementations of <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a>, as these subtags appear between the
   primary language and region subtags.  For example, if a user requests
   content in an implementation of <a href="rfc3066.html#section-2.5">Section 2.5 of [RFC3066]</a> using the
   language range "en-US", content labeled "en-Latn-US" will not match
   the request.  Therefore, it is important to know when script subtags
   will customarily be used and when they ought not be used.  In the
   registry, the Suppress-Script field helps ensure greater
   compatibility between the language tags generated according to the
   rules in this document and language tags and tag processors or
   consumers based on <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> by defining when users SHOULD NOT include
   a script subtag with a particular primary language subtag.

   Extended language subtags (type 'extlang' in the registry; see
   <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) also appear between the primary language and region
   subtags and are reserved for future standardization.  Applications
   might benefit from their judicious use in forming language tags in
   the future.  Similar recommendations are expected to apply to their
   use as apply to script subtags.

   Standards, protocols, and applications that reference this document
   normatively but apply different rules to the ones given in this
   section MUST specify how the procedure varies from the one given
   here.

   The choice of subtags used to form a language tag SHOULD be guided by
   the following rules:

   1.  Use as precise a tag as possible, but no more specific than is
       justified.  Avoid using subtags that are not important for
       distinguishing content in an application.

       *  For example, 'de' might suffice for tagging an email written
          in German, while "de-CH-1996" is probably unnecessarily
          precise for such a task.

   2.  The script subtag SHOULD NOT be used to form language tags unless
       the script adds some distinguishing information to the tag.  The
       field 'Suppress-Script' in the primary language record in the
       registry indicates which script subtags do not add distinguishing
       information for most applications.

       *  For example, the subtag 'Latn' should not be used with the
          primary language 'en' because nearly all English documents are
          written in the Latin script and it adds no distinguishing
          information.  However, if a document were written in English
          mixing Latin script with another script such as Braille
          ('Brai'), then it might be appropriate to choose to indicate
          both scripts to aid in content selection, such as the
          application of a style sheet.

   3.  If a tag or subtag has a 'Preferred-Value' field in its registry
       entry, then the value of that field SHOULD be used to form the
       language tag in preference to the tag or subtag in which the
       preferred value appears.

       *  For example, use 'he' for Hebrew in preference to 'iw'.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4646.html">RFC 4646</a>             Tags for Identifying Languages       September 2006</span>


   4.  The 'und' (Undetermined) primary language subtag SHOULD NOT be
       used to label content, even if the language is unknown.  Omitting
       the language tag altogether is preferred to using a tag with a
       primary language subtag of 'und'.  The 'und' subtag MAY be useful
       for protocols that require a language tag to be provided.  The
       'und' subtag MAY also be useful when matching language tags in
       certain situations.

   5.  The 'mul' (Multiple) primary language subtag SHOULD NOT be used
       whenever the protocol allows the separate tags for multiple
       languages, as is the case for the Content-Language header in
       HTTP.  The 'mul' subtag conveys little useful information:
       content in multiple languages SHOULD individually tag the
       languages where they appear or otherwise indicate the actual
       language in preference to the 'mul' subtag.

   6.  The same variant subtag SHOULD NOT be used more than once within
       a language tag.

       *  For example, do not use "de-DE-1901-1901".

   To ensure consistent backward compatibility, this document contains
   several provisions to account for potential instability in the
   standards used to define the subtags that make up language tags.
   These provisions mean that no language tag created under the rules in
   this document will become obsolete.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Meaning%20of%20the%20Language%20Tag"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Meaning of the Language Tag</span>

   The relationship between the tag and the information it relates to is
   defined by the context in which the tag appears.  Accordingly, this
   section gives only possible examples of its usage.

   o  For a single information object, the associated language tags
      might be interpreted as the set of languages that is necessary for
      a complete comprehension of the complete object.  Example: Plain
      text documents.

   o  For an aggregation of information objects, the associated language
      tags could be taken as the set of languages used inside components
      of that aggregation.  Examples: Document stores and libraries.

   o  For information objects whose purpose is to provide alternatives,
      the associated language tags could be regarded as a hint that the
      content is provided in several languages and that one has to
      inspect each of the alternatives in order to find its language or
      languages.  In this case, the presence of multiple tags might not
      mean that one needs to be multi-lingual to get complete

      understanding of the document.  Example: MIME multipart/
      alternative.

   o  In markup languages, such as HTML and XML, language information
      can be added to each part of the document identified by the markup
      structure (including the whole document itself).  For example, one
      could write &lt;span lang="fr"&gt;C'est la vie.&lt;/span&gt; inside a
      Norwegian document; the Norwegian-speaking user could then access
      a French-Norwegian dictionary to find out what the marked section
      meant.  If the user were listening to that document through a
      speech synthesis interface, this formation could be used to signal
      the synthesizer to appropriately apply French text-to-speech
      pronunciation rules to that span of text, instead of applying the
      inappropriate Norwegian rules.

   Language tags are related when they contain a similar sequence of
   subtags.  For example, if a language tag B contains language tag A as
   a prefix, then B is typically "narrower" or "more specific" than A.
   Thus, "zh-Hant-TW" is more specific than "zh-Hant".

   This relationship is not guaranteed in all cases: specifically,
   languages that begin with the same sequence of subtags are NOT
   guaranteed to be mutually intelligible, although they might be.  For
   example, the tag "az" shares a prefix with both "az-Latn"
   (Azerbaijani written using the Latin script) and "az-Cyrl"
   (Azerbaijani written using the Cyrillic script).  A person fluent in
   one script might not be able to read the other, even though the text
   might be identical.  Content tagged as "az" most probably is written
   in just one script and thus might not be intelligible to a reader
   familiar with the other script.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20Length%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Length Considerations</span>

   [<a id="ref-RFC3066" name="ref-RFC3066">RFC3066</a>] did not provide an upper limit on the size of language
   tags.  While <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> did define the semantics of particular subtags
   in such a way that most language tags consisted of language and
   region subtags with a combined total length of up to six characters,
   larger registered tags were not only possible but were actually
   registered.

   Neither the language tag syntax nor other requirements in this
   document impose a fixed upper limit on the number of subtags in a
   language tag (and thus an upper bound on the size of a tag).  The
   language tag syntax suggests that, depending on the specific
   language, more subtags (and thus a longer tag) are sometimes
   necessary to completely identify the language for certain
   applications; thus, it is possible to envision long or complex subtag
   sequences.

   Some applications and protocols are forced to allocate fixed buffer
   sizes or otherwise limit the length of a language tag.  A conformant
   implementation or specification MAY refuse to support the storage of
   language tags that exceed a specified length.  Any such limitation
   SHOULD be clearly documented, and such documentation SHOULD include
   what happens to longer tags (for example, whether an error value is
   generated or the language tag is truncated).  A protocol that allows
   tags to be truncated at an arbitrary limit, without giving any
   indication of what that limit is, has the potential for causing harm
   by changing the meaning of tags in substantial ways.

   In practice, most language tags do not require more than a few
   subtags and will not approach reasonably sized buffer limitations;
   see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   Some specifications or protocols have limits on tag length but do not
   have a fixed length limitation.  For example, [<a href="rfc2231.html" title='"MIME Parameter Value and Encoded Word Extensions: Character Sets, Languages, and Continuations"'>RFC2231</a>] has no
   explicit length limitation: the length available for the language tag
   is constrained by the length of other header components (such as the
   charset's name) coupled with the 76-character limit in [<a href="rfc2047.html" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text"'>RFC2047</a>].
   Thus, the "limit" might be 50 or more characters, but it could
   potentially be quite small.

   The considerations for assigning a buffer limit are:

      Implementations SHOULD NOT truncate language tags unless the
      meaning of the tag is purposefully being changed, or unless the
      tag does not fit into a limited buffer size specified by a
      protocol for storage or transmission.

      Implementations SHOULD warn the user when a tag is truncated since
      truncation changes the semantic meaning of the tag.

      Implementations of protocols or specifications that are space
      constrained but do not have a fixed limit SHOULD use the longest
      possible tag in preference to truncation.

      Protocols or specifications that specify limited buffer sizes for
      language tags MUST allow for language tags of up to 33 characters.

      Protocols or specifications that specify limited buffer sizes for
      language tags SHOULD allow for language tags of at least 42
      characters.

   The following illustration shows how the 42-character recommendation
   was derived.  The combination of language and extended language
   subtags was chosen for future compatibility.  At up to 15 characters,
   this combination is longer than the longest possible primary language
   subtag (8 characters):

   language      =  3 (ISO 639-2; ISO 639-1 requires 2)
   extlang1      =  4 (each subsequent subtag includes '-')
   extlang2      =  4 (unlikely: needs prefix="language-extlang1")
   extlang3      =  4 (extremely unlikely)
   script        =  5 (if not suppressed: see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>)
   region        =  4 (UN M.49; ISO 3166 requires 3)
   variant1      =  9 (MUST have language as a prefix)
   variant2      =  9 (MUST have language-variant1 as a prefix)

   total         = 42 characters

   Truncation of a language tag alters the meaning of the tag, and thus
   SHOULD be avoided.  However, truncation of language tags is sometimes
   necessary due to limited buffer sizes.  Such truncation MUST NOT
   permit a subtag to be chopped off in the middle or the formation of
   invalid tags (for example, one ending with the "-" character).

   This means that applications or protocols that truncate tags MUST do
   so by progressively removing subtags along with their preceding "-"
   from the right side of the language tag until the tag is short enough
   for the given buffer.  If the resulting tag ends with a single-
   character subtag, that subtag and its preceding "-" MUST also be
   removed.  For example:

   Tag to truncate: zh-Latn-CN-variant1-a-extend1-x-wadegile-private1
   1. zh-Latn-CN-variant1-a-extend1-x-wadegile
   2. zh-Latn-CN-variant1-a-extend1
   3. zh-Latn-CN-variant1
   4. zh-Latn-CN
   5. zh-Latn
   6. zh

   Since a particular language tag is sometimes used by many processes,
   language tags SHOULD always be created or generated in a canonical
   form.

   A language tag is in canonical form when:

   1.  The tag is well-formed according the rules in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a> and
       <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>.

   2.  Subtags of type 'Region' that have a Preferred-Value mapping in
       the IANA registry (see <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) SHOULD be replaced with their
       mapped value.  Note: In rare cases, the mapped value will also
       have a Preferred-Value.

   3.  Redundant or grandfathered tags that have a Preferred-Value
       mapping in the IANA registry (see <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) MUST be replaced
       with their mapped value.  These items either are deprecated
       mappings created before the adoption of this document (such as
       the mapping of "no-nyn" to "nn" or "i-klingon" to "tlh") or are
       the result of later registrations or additions to this document
       (for example, "zh-guoyu" might be mapped to a language-extlang
       combination such as "zh-cmn" by some future update of this
       document).

   4.  Other subtags that have a Preferred-Value mapping in the IANA
       registry (see <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) MUST be replaced with their mapped
       value.  These items consist entirely of clerical corrections to
       ISO 639-1 in which the deprecated subtags have been maintained
       for compatibility purposes.

   5.  If more than one extension subtag sequence exists, the extension
       sequences are ordered into case-insensitive ASCII order by
       singleton subtag.

   Example: The language tag "en-A-aaa-B-ccc-bbb-x-xyz" is in canonical
   form, while "en-B-ccc-bbb-A-aaa-X-xyz" is well-formed but not in
   canonical form.

   Example: The language tag "en-BU" (English as used in Burma) is not
   canonical because the 'BU' subtag has a canonical mapping to 'MM'
   (Myanmar), although the tag "en-BU" maintains its validity.

   Canonicalization of language tags does not imply anything about the
   use of upper or lowercase letters when processing or comparing
   subtags (and as described in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>).  All comparisons MUST be
   performed in a case-insensitive manner.

   When performing canonicalization of language tags, processors MAY
   regularize the case of the subtags (that is, this process is
   OPTIONAL), following the case used in the registry.  Note that this
   corresponds to the following casing rules: uppercase all non-initial
   two-letter subtags; titlecase all non-initial four-letter subtags;
   lowercase everything else.

   Note: Case folding of ASCII letters in certain locales, unless
   carefully handled, sometimes produces non-ASCII character values.
   The Unicode Character Database file "SpecialCasing.txt" defines the
   specific cases that are known to cause problems with this.  In
   particular, the letter 'i' (U+0069) in Turkish and Azerbaijani is
   uppercased to U+0130 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE).
   Implementers SHOULD specify a locale-neutral casing operation to
   ensure that case folding of subtags does not produce this value,
   which is illegal in language tags.  For example, if one were to
   uppercase the region subtag 'in' using Turkish locale rules, the
   sequence U+0130 U+004E would result instead of the expected 'IN'.

   Note: if the field 'Deprecated' appears in a registry record without
   an accompanying 'Preferred-Value' field, then that tag or subtag is
   deprecated without a replacement.  Validating processors SHOULD NOT
   generate tags that include these values, although the values are
   canonical when they appear in a language tag.

   An extension MUST define any relationships that exist between the
   various subtags in the extension and thus MAY define an alternate
   canonicalization scheme for the extension's subtags.  Extensions MAY
   define how the order of the extension's subtags are interpreted.  For
   example, an extension could define that its subtags are in canonical
   order when the subtags are placed into ASCII order: that is,
   "en-a-aaa-bbb-ccc" instead of "en-a-ccc-bbb-aaa".  Another extension
   might define that the order of the subtags influences their semantic
   meaning (so that "en-b-ccc-bbb-aaa" has a different value from
   "en-b-aaa-bbb-ccc").  However, extension specifications SHOULD be
   designed so that they are tolerant of the typical processes described
   in <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>.

   Private use subtags, like all other subtags, MUST conform to the
   format and content constraints in the ABNF.  Private use subtags have
   no meaning outside the private agreement between the parties that
   intend to use or exchange language tags that employ them.  The same
   subtags MAY be used with a different meaning under a separate private
   agreement.  They SHOULD NOT be used where alternatives exist and
   SHOULD NOT be used in content or protocols intended for general use.

   Private use subtags are simply useless for information exchange
   without prior arrangement.  The value and semantic meaning of private
   use tags and of the subtags used within such a language tag are not
   defined by this document.

   Subtags defined in the IANA registry as having a specific private use
   meaning convey more information that a purely private use tag
   prefixed by the singleton subtag 'x'.  For applications, this
   additional information MAY be useful.

   For example, the region subtags 'AA', 'ZZ', and in the ranges
   'QM'-'QZ' and 'XA'-'XZ' (derived from ISO 3166 private use codes) MAY
   be used to form a language tag.  A tag such as "zh-Hans-XQ" conveys a
   great deal of public, interchangeable information about the language
   material (that it is Chinese in the simplified Chinese script and is
   suitable for some geographic region 'XQ').  While the precise
   geographic region is not known outside of private agreement, the tag
   conveys far more information than an opaque tag such as "x-someLang",
   which contains no information about the language subtag or script
   subtag outside of the private agreement.

   However, in some cases content tagged with private use subtags MAY
   interact with other systems in a different and possibly unsuitable
   manner compared to tags that use opaque, privately defined subtags,
   so the choice of the best approach sometimes depends on the
   particular domain in question.

   This section deals with the processes and requirements necessary for
   IANA to undertake to maintain the subtag and extension registries as
   defined by this document and in accordance with the requirements of
   [<a href="rfc2434.html" title='"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"'>RFC2434</a>].

   The impact on the IANA maintainers of the two registries defined by

   Upon adoption of this document, the registry will be initialized by a
   companion document: [<a href="rfc4645.html" title='"Initial Language Subtag Registry"'>RFC4645</a>].  The criteria and process for
   selecting the initial set of records are described in that document.
   The initial set of records represents no impact on IANA, since the
   work to create it will be performed externally.

   The new registry MUST be listed under "Language Tags" at
   &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/numbers.html">http://www.iana.org/numbers.html</a>&gt;, replacing the existing
   registrations defined by [<a href="rfc3066.html" title='"Tags for the Identification of Languages"'>RFC3066</a>].  The existing set of registration
   forms and <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> registrations MUST be relabeled as "Language Tags
   (Obsolete)" and maintained (but not added to or modified).

   Future work on the Language Subtag Registry SHALL be limited to
   inserting or replacing whole records preformatted for IANA by the
   Language Subtag Reviewer as described in <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> of this document
   and archiving the forwarded registration form.

   Each record MUST be sent to iana@iana.org with a subject line
   indicating whether the enclosed record is an insertion of a new
   record (indicated by the word "INSERT" in the subject line) or a
   replacement of an existing record (indicated by the word "MODIFY" in
   the subject line).  Records MUST NOT be deleted from the registry.
   IANA MUST place any inserted or modified records into the appropriate
   section of the language subtag registry, grouping the records by
   their 'Type' field.  Inserted records MAY be placed anywhere in the
   appropriate section; there is no guarantee of the order of the
   records beyond grouping them together by 'Type'.  Modified records
   MUST overwrite the record they replace.

   Included in any request to insert or modify records MUST be a new
   File-Date record.  This record MUST be placed first in the registry.
   In the event that the File-Date record present in the registry has a
   later date than the record being inserted or modified, the existing
   record MUST be preserved.

   The Language Tag Extensions Registry will also be generated and sent
   to IANA as described in <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>.  This registry can contain at
   most 35 records, and thus changes to this registry are expected to be
   very infrequent.

   Future work by IANA on the Language Tag Extensions Registry is
   limited to two cases.  First, the IESG MAY request that new records
   be inserted into this registry from time to time.  These requests
   MUST include the record to insert in the exact format described in
   <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>.  In addition, there MAY be occasional requests from the
   maintaining authority for a specific extension to update the contact
   information or URLs in the record.  These requests MUST include the
   complete, updated record.  IANA is not responsible for validating the
   information provided, only that it is properly formatted.  It should
   reasonably be seen to come from the maintaining authority named in
   the record present in the registry.

   Language tags used in content negotiation, like any other information
   exchanged on the Internet, might be a source of concern because they
   might be used to infer the nationality of the sender, and thus
   identify potential targets for surveillance.

   This is a special case of the general problem that anything sent is
   visible to the receiving party and possibly to third parties as well.
   It is useful to be aware that such concerns can exist in some cases.

   The evaluation of the exact magnitude of the threat, and any possible
   countermeasures, is left to each application protocol (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp72">BCP 72</a>
   [<a href="rfc3552.html" title='"Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations"'>RFC3552</a>] for best current practice guidance on security threats and
   defenses).

   The language tag associated with a particular information item is of
   no consequence whatsoever in determining whether that content might
   contain possible homographs.  The fact that a text is tagged as being
   in one language or using a particular script subtag provides no
   assurance whatsoever that it does not contain characters from scripts
   other than the one(s) associated with or specified by that language
   tag.

   Since there is no limit to the number of variant, private use, and
   extension subtags, and consequently no limit on the possible length
   of a tag, implementations need to guard against buffer overflow
   attacks.  See <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a> for details on language tag truncation,
   which can occur as a consequence of defenses against buffer overflow.

   Although the specification of valid subtags for an extension (see
   <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>) MUST be available over the Internet, implementations
   SHOULD NOT mechanically depend on it being always accessible, to
   prevent denial-of-service attacks.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20Character%20Set%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  Character Set Considerations</span>

   The syntax in this document requires that language tags use only the
   characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and HYPHEN-MINUS, which are present in most
   character sets, so the composition of language tags should not have
   any character set issues.

   Rendering of characters based on the content of a language tag is not
   addressed in this memo.  Historically, some languages have relied on
   the use of specific character sets or other information in order to
   infer how a specific character should be rendered (notably this
   applies to language- and culture-specific variations of Han
   ideographs as used in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean).  When language

   tags are applied to spans of text, rendering engines sometimes use
   that information in deciding which font to use in the absence of
   other information, particularly where languages with distinct writing
   traditions use the same characters.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.%20%20Changes%20from%20RFC%203066"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" name="section-8">8</a>.  Changes from <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a></span>

   The main goals for this revision of language tags were the following:

   *Compatibility.* All <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> language tags (including those in the
   IANA registry) remain valid in this specification.  The changes in
   this document represent additional constraints on language tags.
   That is, in no case is the syntax more permissive and processors
   based on the ABNF and other provisions of <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> (such as those
   described in [<a href="#ref-XMLSchema" title='"XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition"'>XMLSchema</a>]) will be able to process the tags described
   by this document.  In addition, this document defines language tags
   in such as way as to ensure future compatibility.

   *Stability.* Because of changes in the past in the underlying ISO
   standards, a valid <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> language tag could become invalid or have
   its meaning change.  This has the potential of invalidating content
   that may have an extensive shelf-life.  In this specification, once a
   language tag is valid, it remains valid forever.

   *Validity.* The structure of language tags defined by this document
   makes it possible to determine if a particular tag is well-formed
   without regard for the actual content or "meaning" of the tag as a
   whole.  This is important because the registry grows and underlying
   standards change over time.  In addition, it must be possible to
   determine if a tag is valid (or not) for a given point in time in
   order to provide reproducible, testable results.  This process must
   not be error-prone; otherwise implementations might give different
   results.  By having an authoritative registry with specific
   versioning information, the validity of language tags at any point in
   time can be precisely determined (instead of interpolating values
   from many separate sources).

   *Utility.* It is sometimes important to be able to differentiate
   between written forms of a language -- for many implementations this
   is more important than distinguishing between the spoken variants of
   a language.  Languages are written in a wide variety of different
   scripts, so this document provides for the generative use of ISO
   15924 script codes.  Like the generative use of ISO language and
   country codes in <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a>, this allows combinations to be produced
   without resorting to the registration process.  The addition of UN
   M.49 codes provides for the generation of language tags with regional
   scope, which is also required by some applications.




<span class="grey">Phillips &amp; Davis         Best Current Practice                 [Page 49]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-50" id="page-50" name="page-50"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4646.html">RFC 4646</a>             Tags for Identifying Languages       September 2006</span>


   The recast of the registry from containing whole language tags to
   subtags is a key part of this.  An important feature of <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a> was
   that it allowed generative use of subtags.  This allows people to
   meaningfully use generated tags, without the delays in registering
   whole tags or the need to register all of the combinations that might
   be useful.

   The choice of placing the extended language and script subtags
   between the primary language and region subtags was widely debated.
   This design was chosen because the prevalent matching and content
   negotiation schemes rely on the subtags being arranged in order of
   increasing specificity.  That is, the subtags that mark a greater
   barrier to mutual intelligibility appear left-most in a tag.  For
   example, when selecting content written in Azerbaijani, the script
   (Arabic, Cyrillic, or Latin) represents a greater barrier to
   understanding than any regional variations (those associated with
   Azerbaijan or Iran, for example).  Individuals who prefer documents
   in a particular script, but can deal with the minor regional
   differences, can therefore select appropriate content.  Applications
   that do not deal with written content will continue to omit these
   subtags.

   *Extensibility.* Because of the widespread use of language tags, it
   is disruptive to have periodic revisions of the core specification,
   even in the face of demonstrated need.  The extension mechanism
   provides for a way for independent RFCs to define extensions to
   language tags.  These extensions have a very constrained, well-
   defined structure that prevents extensions from interfering with
   implementations of language tags defined in this document.

   The document also anticipates features of ISO 639-3 with the addition
   of the extended language subtags, as well as the possibility of other
   ISO 639 parts becoming useful for the formation of language tags in
   the future.

   The use and definition of private use tags have also been modified,
   to allow people to use private use subtags to extend or modify
   defined tags and to move as much information as possible out of
   private use and into the regular structure.

   The goal for each of these modifications is to reduce or eliminate
   the need for future revisions of this document.

   The specific changes in this document to meet these goals are:

   o  Defines the ABNF and rules for subtags so that the category of all
      subtags can be determined without reference to the registry.

   o  Adds the concept of well-formed vs. validating processors,
      defining the rules by which an implementation can claim to be one
      or the other.

   o  Replaces the IANA language tag registry with a language subtag
      registry that provides a complete list of valid subtags in the
      IANA registry.  This allows for robust implementation and ease of
      maintenance.  The language subtag registry becomes the canonical
      source for forming language tags.

   o  Provides a process that guarantees stability of language tags, by
      handling reuse of values by ISO 639, ISO 15924, and ISO 3166 in
      the event that they register a previously used value for a new
      purpose.

   o  Allows ISO 15924 script code subtags and allows them to be used
      generatively.  Defines a method for indicating in the registry
      when script subtags are necessary for a given language tag.

   o  Adds the concept of a variant subtag and allows variants to be
      used generatively.

   o  Adds the ability to use a class of UN M.49 tags for supra-national
      regions and to resolve conflicts in the assignment of ISO 3166
      codes.

   o  Defines the private use tags in ISO 639, ISO 15924, and ISO 3166
      as the mechanism for creating private use language, script, and
      region subtags, respectively.

   o  Adds a well-defined extension mechanism.

   o  Defines an extended language subtag, possibly for use with certain
      anticipated features of ISO 639-3.
