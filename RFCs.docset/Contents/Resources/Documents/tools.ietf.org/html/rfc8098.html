<meta content='This memo defines a MIME content type that may be used by a Mail User
Agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a
message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient. This
content type is intended to be machine processable. Additional message
header fields are also defined to permit Message Disposition
Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message. The
purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often
found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary
"LAN-based" systems, and are often referred to as "read receipts,"
"acknowledgements," or "receipt notifications." The intention is to do
this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been
expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past.
Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other
messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary "LAN-based"
systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multiprotocol
messaging environment. To this end, the protocol described in this
memo provides for the carriage of "foreign" addresses, in addition to
those normally used in Internet Mail. Additional attributes may also
be defined to support "tunneling" of foreign notifications through
Internet Mail.  This document is an Internet Standard. It obsoletes
RFC 3798 and updates RFC 2046 (message/partial media type handling)
and RFC 3461 (Original-Recipient header field generation requirement).' name="DC.Description.Abstract"/>

Abstract

   This memo defines a MIME content type that may be used by a Mail User
   Agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a
   message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient.
   This content type is intended to be machine processable.  Additional
   message header fields are also defined to permit Message Disposition
   Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message.  The
   purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often
   found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary
   "LAN-based" systems, and are often referred to as "read receipts,"
   "acknowledgements," or "receipt notifications."  The intention is to
   do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been
   expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past.

   Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other
   messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary "LAN-based"
   systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a
   multiprotocol messaging environment.  To this end, the protocol
   described in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign"
   addresses, in addition to those normally used in Internet Mail.
   Additional attributes may also be defined to support "tunneling" of
   foreign notifications through Internet Mail.

   This document is an Internet Standard.  It obsoletes <a href="rfc3798.html">RFC 3798</a> and
   updates <a href="rfc2046.html">RFC 2046</a> (message/partial media type handling) and <a href="rfc3461.html">RFC 3461</a>
   (Original-Recipient header field generation requirement).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This memo defines a media type [<a href="rfc2046.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>RFC2046</a>] for Message Disposition
   Notifications (MDNs).  An MDN can be used to notify the sender of a
   message of any of several conditions that may occur after successful
   delivery, such as display of the message contents, printing of the
   message, deletion (without display) of the message, or the
   recipient's refusal to provide MDNs.  The "message/disposition-
   notification" content type defined herein is intended for use within
   the framework of the "multipart/report" content type defined in
   RFC-REPORT [<a href="rfc6522.html" title='"The Multipart/Report Media Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>RFC6522</a>].

   This memo defines the format of the notifications and the RFC-MSGFMT
   [<a href="rfc5322.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>] header fields used to request them.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Purposes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Purposes</span>

   The MDNs defined in this memo are expected to serve several purposes:

   a.  Inform human beings of the disposition of messages after
       successful delivery in a manner that is largely independent of
       human language;

   b.  Allow mail user agents to keep track of the disposition of
       messages sent by associating returned MDNs with earlier message
       transmissions;

   c.  Convey disposition notification requests and disposition
       notifications between Internet Mail and "foreign" mail systems
       via a gateway;

   d.  Allow "foreign" notifications to be tunneled through a MIME-
       capable messaging system and back into the original messaging
       system that issued the original notification, or even to a third
       messaging system;

   e.  Allow language-independent, yet reasonably precise, indications
       of the disposition of a message to be delivered.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.%20%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Requirements</span>

   These purposes place the following constraints on the notification
   protocol:

   a.  It must be readable by humans and must be machine parsable.

   b.  It must provide enough information to allow message senders (or
       their user agents) to unambiguously associate an MDN with the
       message that was sent and the original recipient address for
       which the MDN was issued (if such information is available), even
       if the message was forwarded to another recipient address.

   c.  It must also be able to describe the disposition of a message
       independent of any particular human language or of the
       terminology of any particular mail system.

   d.  The specification must be extensible in order to accommodate
       future requirements.

   All syntax descriptions use the ABNF specified by RFC-MSGFMT

   Message disposition notifications are requested by including a
   Disposition-Notification-To header field in the message containing
   one or more addresses specifying where dispositions should be sent.
   Further information to be used by the recipient's Mail User Agent
   (MUA) [<a href="rfc5598.html" title='"Internet Mail Architecture"'>RFC5598</a>] in generating the MDN may be provided by also
   including Original-Recipient and/or Disposition-Notification-Options
   header fields in the message.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20The%20Disposition-Notification-To%20Header"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  The Disposition-Notification-To Header</span>

   A request for the receiving user agent to issue message disposition
   notifications is made by placing a Disposition-Notification-To header
   field into the message.  The syntax of the header field is

   mdn-request-header = "Disposition-Notification-To" ":"
              mailbox-list CRLF

   A Disposition-Notification-To header field can appear in a message at
   most once.




<span class="grey">Hansen &amp; Melnikov            Standards Track                    [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc8098.html">RFC 8098</a>                           MDN                     February 2017</span>


   The presence of a Disposition-Notification-To header field in a
   message is merely a request for an MDN.  The recipients' user agents
   are always free to silently ignore such a request.

   An MDN MUST NOT itself have a Disposition-Notification-To header
   field.  An MDN MUST NOT be generated in response to an MDN.

   A user agent MUST NOT issue more than one MDN on behalf of each
   particular recipient.  That is, once an MDN has been issued on behalf
   of a recipient, no further MDNs may be issued on behalf of that
   recipient by the same user agent, even if another disposition is
   performed on the message.  However, if a message is forwarded, an MDN
   may have been issued for the recipient doing the forwarding, and the
   recipient of the forwarded message may also cause an MDN to be
   generated.

   It is also possible that if the same message is being accessed by
   multiple user agents (for example, using POP3), then multiple
   dispositions might be generated for the same recipient.  User agents
   SHOULD leverage support in the underlying message access protocol to
   prevent multiple MDNs from being generated.  In particular, when the
   user agent is accessing the message using RFC-IMAP [<a href="rfc3501.html" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>RFC3501</a>], it
   SHOULD implement the procedures specified in RFC-IMAP-MDN [<a href="rfc3503.html" title='"Message Disposition Notification (MDN) profile for Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)"'>RFC3503</a>].

   While Internet standards normally do not specify the behavior of user
   interfaces, it is strongly recommended that the user agent obtain the
   user's consent before sending an MDN.  This consent could be obtained
   for each message through some sort of prompt or dialog box, or
   globally through the user's setting of a preference.  The user might
   also indicate globally that MDNs are to never be sent.  The purpose
   of obtaining user's consent is to protect user's privacy.  The
   default value should be not to send MDNs.

   MDNs MUST NOT be sent automatically if the address in the
   Disposition-Notification-To header field differs from the address in
   the Return-Path header field (see RFC-MSGFMT [<a href="rfc5322.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>]).  In this
   case, confirmation from the user MUST be obtained, if possible.  If
   obtaining consent is not possible (e.g., because the user is not
   online at the time or the client is not an interactive email client),
   then an MDN MUST NOT be sent.

   Confirmation from the user MUST be obtained (or no MDN sent) if there
   is no Return-Path header field in the message or if there is more
   than one distinct address in the Disposition-Notification-To header
   field.

   The comparison of the addresses is done using only the addr-spec
   (local-part "@" domain) portion, excluding any angle brackets,
   phrase, and route.  As prescribed by <a href="rfc5322.html">RFC 5322</a>, the comparison is case
   sensitive for the local-part and case insensitive for the domain
   part.  The local-part comparison SHOULD be done after performing
   local-part canonicalization, i.e., after removing the surrounding
   double-quote characters, if any, as well as any escaping "\"
   characters.  (See RFC-MSGFMT [<a href="rfc5322.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>] for more details.)
   Implementations MAY treat known domain aliases as equivalent for the
   purpose of comparison.

   Note that use of subaddressing (see [<a href="rfc5233.html" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Subaddress Extension"'>RFC5233</a>]) can result in a
   failure to match two local-parts and thus result in possible
   suppression of the MDN.  This document doesn't recommend special
   handling for this case, as the receiving MUA can't reliably know
   whether or not the sender is using subaddressing.

   If the message contains more than one Return-Path header field, the
   implementation may pick one to use for the comparison or treat the
   situation as a failure of the comparison.

   The reason for not automatically sending an MDN if the comparison
   fails or more than one address is specified is to reduce the
   possibility of mail loops and of MDNs being used for mail bombing.

   It's especially important that a message that contains a Disposition-
   Notification-To header field also contain a Message-ID header field
   to permit user agents to automatically correlate MDNs with their
   original messages.

   If the request for message disposition notifications for some
   recipients and not others is desired, two copies of the message
   should be sent, one with a Disposition-Notification-To header field
   and one without.  Many of the other header fields of the message
   (e.g., To, Cc) will be the same in both copies.  The recipients in
   the respective message envelopes determine from whom message
   disposition notifications are requested and from whom they are not.
   If desired, the Message-ID header field may be the same in both
   copies of the message.  Note that there are other situations (e.g.,
   Bcc) in which it is necessary to send multiple copies of a message
   with slightly different header fields.  The combination of such
   situations and the need to request MDNs for a subset of all
   recipients may result in more than two copies of a message being
   sent, some with a Disposition-Notification-To header field and some
   without.

   If it is possible to determine that a recipient is a newsgroup, do
   not include a Disposition-Notification-To header field for that
   recipient.  Similarly, if an existing message is resent or gatewayed
   to a newsgroup, the agent that is resending/gatewaying SHOULD strip
   the Disposition-Notification-To header field.  See <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> for more
   discussion.  Clients that see an otherwise valid Disposition-
   Notification-To header field in a newsgroup message SHOULD NOT
   generate an MDN.

   Extensions to this specification may require that information be
   supplied to the recipient's MUA for additional control over how and
   what MDNs are generated.  The Disposition-Notification-Options header
   field provides an extensible mechanism for such information.  The
   syntax of this header field is as follows:

   Disposition-Notification-Options =
             "Disposition-Notification-Options" ":" [FWS]
                            disposition-notification-parameter-list CRLF

   disposition-notification-parameter-list =
             disposition-notification-parameter
             *([FWS] ";" [FWS] disposition-notification-parameter)

   disposition-notification-parameter = attribute [FWS] "="
             [FWS] importance [FWS] "," [FWS] value
             *([FWS] "," [FWS] value)

   importance = "required" / "optional"

   attribute = Atom

   value = word

   A Disposition-Notification-Options header field can appear in a
   message at most once.

   An importance of "required" indicates that interpretation of the
   disposition-notification-parameter is necessary for proper generation
   of an MDN in response to this request.  An importance of "optional"
   indicates that an MUA that does not understand the meaning of this
   disposition-notification-parameter MAY generate an MDN in response
   anyway, ignoring the value of the disposition-notification-parameter.

   No disposition-notification-parameter attribute names are defined in
   this specification.  Attribute names may be defined in the future by
   later revisions or extensions to this specification.  Disposition-

   notification-parameter attribute names MUST be registered with the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) using the "Specification
   Required" registration policy [<a href="rfc5226.html" title='"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"'>RFC5226</a>].  The "X-" prefix has
   historically been used to denote unregistered "experimental" protocol
   elements that are assumed not to become common use.  Deployment
   experience of this and other protocols has shown that this assumption
   is often false.  This document allows the use of the "X-" prefix
   primarily to allow the registration of attributes that are already in
   common use.  The prefix has no meaning for new attributes.  Its use
   in substantially new attributes may cause confusion and is therefore
   discouraged.  (See <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> for a registration form.)

   Since electronic mail addresses may be rewritten while the message is
   in transit, it is useful for the original recipient address to be
   made available by the delivering Message Transfer Agent (MTA)
   [<a href="rfc5598.html" title='"Internet Mail Architecture"'>RFC5598</a>].  The delivering MTA may be able to obtain this information
   from the ORCPT parameter of the SMTP RCPT TO command, as defined in
   RFC-SMTP [<a href="rfc5321.html" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>RFC5321</a>] and RFC-DSN-SMTP [<a href="rfc3461.html" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extension for Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)"'>RFC3461</a>].

   RFC-DSN-SMTP [<a href="rfc3461.html" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extension for Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)"'>RFC3461</a>] is amended as follows: if the ORCPT
   information is available, the delivering MTA SHOULD insert an
   Original-Recipient header field at the beginning of the message
   (along with the Return-Path header field).  The delivering MTA MAY
   delete any other Original-Recipient header fields that occur in the
   message.  The syntax of this header field is as follows:

   original-recipient-header =
             "Original-Recipient" ":" OWS address-type OWS
             ";" OWS generic-address OWS

   OWS = [CFWS]
         ; Optional whitespace.
         ; MDN generators SHOULD use "*WSP"
         ; (Typically a single space or nothing.
         ; It SHOULD be nothing at the end of a field.),
         ; unless an <a href="rfc5322.html">RFC 5322</a> "comment" is required.
         ;
         ; MDN parsers MUST parse it as "[CFWS]".

   The address-type and generic-address tokens are as specified in the
   description of the Original-Recipient field in <a href="#section-3.2.3">Section 3.2.3</a>.

   The purpose of carrying the original recipient information and
   returning it in the MDN is to permit automatic correlation of MDNs
   with the original message on a per-recipient basis.

   The use of the header fields Disposition-Notification-To,
   Disposition-Notification-Options, and Original-Recipient with the
   MIME message/partial content type (RFC-MIME-MEDIA [<a href="rfc2046.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>RFC2046</a>]) requires
   further definition.

   When a message is segmented into two or more message/partial
   fragments, the three header fields mentioned in the above paragraph
   SHOULD be placed in the "inner" or "enclosed" message (using the
   terms of RFC-MIME-MEDIA [<a href="rfc2046.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>RFC2046</a>]).  If these header fields are found
   in the header fields of any of the fragments, they are ignored.

   When the multiple message/partial fragments are reassembled, the
   following applies.  If these header fields occur along with the other
   header fields of a message/partial fragment message, they pertain to
   an MDN that will be generated for the fragment.  If these header
   fields occur in the header fields of the "inner" or "enclosed"
   message (using the terms of RFC-MIME-MEDIA [<a href="rfc2046.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>RFC2046</a>]), they pertain

   that, in addition to the header fields specified there, the three
   header fields described in this specification are to be appended, in
   order, to the header fields of the reassembled message.  Any
   occurrences of the three header fields defined here in the header
   fields of the initial enclosing message MUST NOT be copied to the

   A message disposition notification is a MIME message with a top-level
   content type of multipart/report (defined in RFC-REPORT [<a href="rfc6522.html" title='"The Multipart/Report Media Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>RFC6522</a>]).
   When multipart/report content is used to transmit an MDN:

   a.  The report-type parameter of the multipart/report content is
       "disposition-notification".

   b.  The first component of the multipart/report contains a human-
       readable explanation of the MDN, as described in RFC-REPORT
       [<a href="rfc6522.html" title='"The Multipart/Report Media Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>RFC6522</a>].

   c.  The second component of the multipart/report is of content type
       message/disposition-notification, described in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> of
       this document.

   d.  If the original message or a portion of the message is to be
       returned to the sender, it appears as the third component of the

   fields that contain equivalent information.  In particular, it is
   very desirable to preserve the subject and date fields from the
   original message.

   The MDN MUST be addressed (in both the message header field and the
   transport envelope) to the address(es) from the Disposition-
   Notification-To header field from the original message for which the
   MDN is being generated.

   The From header field of the MDN MUST contain the address of the
   person for whom the message disposition notification is being issued.

   The envelope sender address (i.e., SMTP "MAIL FROM") of the MDN MUST
   be null (&lt;&gt;), specifying that no Delivery Status Notification
   messages nor other messages indicating successful or unsuccessful
   delivery are to be sent in response to an MDN.

   A message disposition notification MUST NOT itself request an MDN.
   That is, it MUST NOT contain a Disposition-Notification-To header
   field.

   The Message-ID header field (if present) for an MDN MUST be different
   from the Message-ID of the message for which the MDN is being issued.

   A particular MDN describes the disposition of exactly one message for
   exactly one recipient.  Multiple MDNs may be generated as a result of
   one message submission, one per recipient.  However, due to the
   circumstances described in <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>, it's possible that some of
   the recipients for whom MDNs were requested will not generate MDNs.

   Intended usage:     COMMON

   Restrictions on usage:  This media type contains textual data in the
                       US-ASCII charset, which is always 7bit.

   Provisional registration?  no

   (While the 7bit restriction applies to the message/disposition-
   notification portion of the multipart/report content, it does not
   apply to the optional third portion of the multipart/report content.)

   The message/disposition-notification report type for use in the
   multipart/report is "disposition-notification".

   The body of a message/disposition-notification consists of one or
   more "fields" formatted according to the ABNF of RFC-MSGFMT [<a href="rfc5322.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>]
   header "fields".  The syntax of the message/disposition-notification
   content is as follows:

   disposition-notification-content = [ reporting-ua-field CRLF ]
             [ mdn-gateway-field CRLF ]
             [ original-recipient-field CRLF ]

   Note that the order of the above fields is recommended but not fixed.
   Extension fields can appear anywhere.

   Several fields consist of a "-type" subfield, followed by a semi-
   colon, followed by "*text".  For these fields, the keyword used in
   the address-type or MTA-type subfield indicates the expected format
   of the address or MTA-name that follows.

   The "-type" subfields are defined as follows:

   a.  An "address-type" specifies the format of a mailbox address.  For
       example, Internet Mail addresses use the "<a href="rfc822.html">rfc822</a>" address-type.
       Other values can appear in this field as specified in the
       "Address Types" IANA subregistry established by RFC-DSN-FORMAT
       [<a href="rfc3464.html" title='"An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications"'>RFC3464</a>].

   Atom = &lt;The version from <a href="rfc5321.html">RFC 5321</a> (not from <a href="rfc5322.html">RFC 5322</a>)
              is used in this document.&gt;

   b.  An "MTA-name-type" specifies the format of a mail transfer agent
       name.  For example, for an SMTP server on an Internet host, the
       MTA name is the domain name of that host, and the "dns" MTA-name-
       type is used.  Other values can appear in this field as specified
       in the "MTA Name Types" IANA subregistry established by RFC-DSN-
       FORMAT [<a href="rfc3464.html" title='"An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications"'>RFC3464</a>].

   mta-name-type = Atom

   Values for address-type and mta-name-type are case insensitive.
   Thus, address-type values of "<a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a>" and "<a href="rfc822.html">rfc822</a>" are equivalent.

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry
   of address-type and mta-name-type values, along with descriptions of
   the meanings of each or a reference to one or more specifications
   that provide such descriptions.  (The "<a href="rfc822.html">rfc822</a>" address-type is
   defined in RFC-DSN-SMTP [<a href="rfc3461.html" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extension for Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)"'>RFC3461</a>].)  Registration forms for address-
   type and mta-name-type appear in RFC-DSN-FORMAT [<a href="rfc3464.html" title='"An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications"'>RFC3464</a>].

                  %d11 / %d12 / %d14-58 / %d60-127  ; LF, or semi-colon

   The Reporting-UA field is defined as follows:

   An MDN describes the disposition of a message after it has been
   delivered to a recipient.  In all cases, the Reporting-UA is the MUA
   that performed the disposition described in the MDN.

   The "Reporting-UA" field contains information about the MUA that
   generated the MDN, which is often used by servers to help identify
   the scope of reported interoperability problems, to work around or
   tailor responses to avoid particular MUA limitations, and for
   analytics regarding MUA or operating system use.  An MUA SHOULD send
   a "Reporting-UA" field unless specifically configured not to do so.

   If the reporting MUA consists of more than one component (e.g., a
   base program and plug-ins), this may be indicated by including a list
   of product names.

   A reporting MUA SHOULD limit generated product identifiers to what is
   necessary to identify the product; a sender MUST NOT generate
   advertising or other nonessential information within the product
   identifier.

   A reporting MUA SHOULD NOT generate a "Reporting-UA" field containing
   needlessly fine-grained detail and SHOULD limit the addition of
   subproducts by third parties.  Overly long and detailed "Reporting-
   UA" field values increase the risk of a user being identified against
   their wishes ("fingerprinting").

   Likewise, implementations are encouraged not to use the product
   tokens of other implementations in order to declare compatibility
   with them, as this circumvents the purpose of the field.  If an MUA
   masquerades as a different MUA, recipients can assume that the user

   The MDN-Gateway field indicates the name of the gateway or MTA that
   translated a foreign (non-Internet) message disposition notification
   into this MDN.  This field MUST appear in any MDN that was translated
   by a gateway from a foreign system into MDN format and MUST NOT
   appear otherwise.

   mdn-gateway-field = "MDN-Gateway" ":" OWS mta-name-type OWS
                       ";" OWS mta-name OWS

   mta-name = *text

   For gateways into Internet Mail, the MTA-name-type will normally be
   "dns", and the mta-name will be the Internet domain name of the
   gateway.

   The Original-Recipient field indicates the original recipient address
   as specified by the sender of the message for which the MDN is being
   issued.  For Internet Mail messages, the value of the Original-
   Recipient field is obtained from the Original-Recipient header field
   from the message for which the MDN is being generated.  If there is
   an Original-Recipient header field in the message, or if information
   about the original recipient is reliably available some other way,
   then the Original-Recipient field MUST be included.  Otherwise, the
   Original-Recipient field MUST NOT be included.  If there is more than
   one Original-Recipient header field in the message, the MUA may
   choose the one to use or act as if no Original-Recipient header field
   is present.

             "Original-Recipient" ":" OWS address-type OWS

   type field will normally be "<a href="rfc822.html">rfc822</a>", and the address will be
   according to the syntax specified in RFC-MSGFMT [<a href="rfc5322.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>].  The value
   "unknown" should be used if the Reporting MUA cannot determine the
   type of the original recipient address from the message envelope.
   This address is the same as that provided by the sender and can be
   used to automatically correlate MDN reports with original messages on
   a per-recipient basis.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.4.%20%20Final-Recipient%20Field"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.4" name="section-3.2.4">3.2.4</a>.  Final-Recipient Field</span>

   The Final-Recipient field indicates the recipient for which the MDN
   is being issued.  This field MUST be present.

   The syntax of the field is as follows:

   final-recipient-field = "Final-Recipient" ":" OWS address-type OWS
                           ";" OWS generic-address OWS

   The generic-address subfield of the Final-Recipient field SHOULD
   contain the mailbox address of the recipient (which will be the same
   as the From header field of the MDN) as it was when the MDN was
   generated by the MUA.

      One example of when this field might not contain the final
      recipient address of the message is when an alias (e.g.,
      &lt;customer-support@example.com&gt;) forwards mail to a specific
      personal address (e.g., &lt;bob@example.com&gt;).  Bob might want to be
      able to send MDNs but not give away his personal email address.
      In this case, the Final-Recipient field can contain:

         Final-Recipient: <a href="rfc822.html">rfc822</a>;customer-support@example.com

      in place of:

         Final-Recipient: <a href="rfc822.html">rfc822</a>;bob@example.com

   The Final-Recipient address may differ from the address originally
   provided by the sender, because it may have been transformed during
   forwarding and gatewaying into a totally unrecognizable mess.
   However, in the absence of the optional Original-Recipient field, the
   Final-Recipient field and any returned content may be the only
   information available with which to correlate the MDN with a
   particular message recipient.

   The address-type subfield indicates the type of address expected by
   the reporting MTA in that context.  Recipient addresses obtained via
   SMTP will normally be of address-type "<a href="rfc822.html">rfc822</a>", but can be other

   The Original-Message-ID field indicates the message-ID of the message
   for which the MDN is being issued.  It is obtained from the
   Message-ID header field of the message for which the MDN is issued.
   This field MUST be present if and only if the original message
   contained a Message-ID header field.  The syntax of the field is as
   follows:

             "Original-Message-ID" ":" msg-id

   Disposition mode consists of two parts: action mode and sending mode.

   The following action modes are defined:

   "manual-action"     The disposition described by the disposition type
                       was a result of an explicit instruction by the
                       user rather than some sort of automatically
                       performed action.  (This might include the case
                       when the user has manually configured her MUA to
                       automatically respond to valid MDN requests.)
                       Unless prescribed otherwise in a particular mail
                       environment, in order to preserve the user's
                       privacy, this MUST be the default for MUAs.

   "automatic-action"  The disposition described by the disposition type
                       was a result of an automatic action rather than
                       an explicit instruction by the user for this
                       message.  This is typically generated by a Mail
                       Delivery Agent (e.g., MDN generations by Sieve
                       reject action [<a href="rfc5429.html" title='"Sieve Email Filtering: Reject and Extended Reject Extensions"'>RFC5429</a>], Fax-over-Email

                       upon delivery to a mailing list).

   "Manual-action" and "automatic-action" are mutually exclusive.  One
   or the other MUST be specified.

   The following sending modes are defined:

   "MDN-sent-manually" The user explicitly gave permission for this
                       particular MDN to be sent.  Unless prescribed
                       otherwise in a particular mail environment, in
                       order to preserve the user's privacy, this MUST
                       be the default for MUAs.

   "MDN-sent-automatically"
                       The MDN was sent because the MUA had previously
                       been configured to do so automatically.

   "MDN-sent-manually" and "MDN-sent-automatically" are mutually
   exclusive.  One or the other MUST be specified.

   The following disposition-types are defined:

   "displayed"         The message has been displayed by the MUA to
                       someone reading the recipient's mailbox.  There
                       is no guarantee that the content has been read or
                       understood.

   "dispatched"        The message has been sent somewhere in some
                       manner (e.g., printed, faxed, forwarded) without
                       necessarily having been previously displayed to
                       the user.  The user may or may not see the
                       message later.

   "processed"         The message has been processed in some manner
                       (i.e., by some sort of rules or server) without
                       being displayed to the user.  The user may or may
                       not see the message later, or there may not even
                       be a human user associated with the mailbox.

   "deleted"           The message has been deleted.  The recipient may
                       or may not have seen the message.  The recipient
                       might "undelete" the message at a later time and
                       read the message.

   Only the extension disposition modifiers are defined:

   disposition-modifier-extension
                       Disposition modifiers may be defined in the
                       future by later revisions or extensions to this
                       specification.  MDN disposition value names MUST
                       be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers
                       Authority (IANA) using the "Specification
                       Required" registration policy.  (See <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>
                       for a registration form.)  MDNs with disposition
                       modifier names not understood by the receiving
                       MUA MAY be silently ignored or placed in the
                       user's mailbox without special interpretation.
                       They MUST NOT cause any error message to be sent
                       to the sender of the MDN.

   It is not required that an MUA be able to generate all of the
   possible values of the Disposition field.

   A user agent MUST NOT issue more than one MDN on behalf of each
   particular recipient.  That is, once an MDN has been issued on behalf
   of a recipient, no further MDNs may be issued on behalf of that
   recipient, even if another disposition is performed on the message.
   However, if a message is forwarded, a "dispatched" MDN MAY be issued
   for the recipient doing the forwarding and the recipient of the
   forwarded message may also cause an MDN to be generated.

   The Error field is used to supply additional information in the form
   of text messages when the "error" disposition modifier appears.  The
   syntax is as follows:

   error-field = "Error" ":" *([FWS] text)

   Note that syntax of these header fields doesn't include comments, so
   the "encoded-word" construct defined in RFC-MIME-HEADER [<a href="rfc2047.html" title='"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text"'>RFC2047</a>]
   can't be used to convey non-ASCII text.  Applications that need to
   convey non-ASCII text in these fields should consider implementing
   the message/global-disposition-notification media type specified in
   [<a href="rfc6533.html" title='"Internationalized Delivery Status and Disposition Notifications"'>RFC6533</a>] instead of this specification.

   Additional MDN fields may be defined in the future by later revisions
   or extensions to this specification.  MDN field names MUST be
   registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) using
   the "Specification Required" registration policy.  (See <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>
   for a registration form.)  MDN Extension-fields may be defined for
   the following reasons:

   a.  To allow additional information from foreign disposition reports
       to be tunneled through Internet MDNs.  The names of such MDN
       fields should begin with an indication of the foreign environment
       name (e.g., X400-Physical-Forwarding-Address).

   b.  To allow transmission of diagnostic information that is specific
       to a particular Mail User Agent (MUA).  The names of such MDN
       fields should begin with an indication of the MUA implementation
       that produced the MDN (e.g., Foomail-information).

   The following timeline shows when various events in the processing of
   a message and generation of MDNs take place:

   -- User composes message.

   -- User tells MUA to send message.

   -- MUA passes message to Mail Submission Agent (MSA) and original
      recipient information is passed along.

   -- MSA sends message to next MTA.

   -- Final MTA receives message.

   -- Final MTA delivers message to recipient's mailbox (possibly
      generating a Delivery Status Notification (DSN)).

   -- (Recipient's) MUA discovers a new message in recipient's mailbox
      and decides whether an MDN should be generated.  If the MUA has
      information that an MDN has already been generated for this
      message, no further MDN processing described below is performed.
      If MUA decides that no MDN can be generated, no further MDN
      processing described below is performed.

   -- MUA performs automatic processing and might generate corresponding
      MDNs ("dispatched", "processed", or "deleted" disposition type
      with "automatic-action" and "MDN-sent-automatically" disposition
      modes).  The MUA remembers that an MDN was generated.

   -- MUA displays list of messages to user.

   -- User selects a message and requests that some action be performed
      on it.

   -- MUA performs requested action; if an automatic MDN has not already
      been generated, with user's permission, sends an appropriate MDN
      ("displayed", "dispatched", "processed", or "deleted" disposition
      type, with "manual-action" and "MDN-sent-manually" or "MDN-sent-
      automatically" disposition mode).  The MUA remembers that an MDN
      was generated.

   -- User possibly performs other actions on message, but no further
      MDNs are generated.

   An MUA or gateway conforms to this specification if it generates MDNs
   according to the protocol defined in this memo.  It is not necessary
   to be able to generate all of the possible values of the Disposition
   field.

   MUAs and gateways MUST NOT generate the Original-Recipient field of
   an MDN unless the mail protocols provide the address originally
   specified by the sender at the time of submission.  Ordinary SMTP
   does not make that guarantee, but the SMTP extension defined in RFC--
   DSN-SMTP [<a href="rfc3461.html" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extension for Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)"'>RFC3461</a>] permits such information to be carried in the
   envelope if it is available.  The Original-Recipient header field
   defined in this document provides a way for the MTA to pass the
   original recipient address to the MUA.

   Each sender-specified recipient address may result in more than one
   MDN.  If an MDN is requested for a recipient that is forwarded to
   multiple recipients of an "alias" (as defined in <a href="#section-6.2.7.3">Section 6.2.7.3</a> of
   RFC-DSN-SMTP [<a href="rfc3461.html" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extension for Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)"'>RFC3461</a>]), each of the recipients may issue an MDN.

   Successful distribution of a message to a mailing list exploder or
   gateway to Usenet newsgroup SHOULD be considered the final
   disposition of the message.  A mailing list exploder MAY issue an MDN
   with a disposition type of "processed" and disposition modes of
   "automatic-action" and "MDN-sent-automatically" indicating that the
   message has been forwarded to the list.  In this case, the request
   for MDNs is not propagated to the members of the list.

   Alternatively (if successful distribution of a message to a mailing
   list exploder / Usenet newsgroup is not considered the final
   disposition of the message), the mailing list exploder can issue no
   MDN and propagate the request for MDNs to all members of the list.
   The latter behavior is not recommended for any but small, closely
   knit lists, as it might cause large numbers of MDNs to be generated
   and may cause confidential subscribers to the list to be revealed.
   The mailing list exploder can also direct MDNs to itself, correlate
   them, and produce a report to the original sender of the message.

   This specification places no restrictions on the processing of MDNs
   received by user agents or mailing lists.

   The following security considerations apply when using MDNs.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1.%20%20Forgery"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Forgery</span>

   MDNs can be (and are, in practice) forged as easily as ordinary
   Internet electronic mail.  User agents and automatic mail handling
   facilities (such as mail distribution list exploders) that wish to
   make automatic use of MDNs should take appropriate precautions to
   minimize the potential damage from denial-of-service attacks.

   Security threats related to forged MDNs include the sending of:

   a.  A falsified disposition notification when the indicated
       disposition of the message has not actually occurred, and

   b.  Unsolicited MDNs.

   Similarly, a forged spam or phishing email message can contain
   Disposition-Notification-To header field that can trick the recipient
   to send an MDN.  MDN processing should only be invoked once
   authenticity of an email message is verified.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.2.%20%20Privacy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2" name="section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Privacy</span>

   Another dimension of security is privacy.  There may be cases in
   which a message recipient does not wish the disposition of messages
   addressed to him to be known, or is concerned that the sending of
   MDNs may reveal other sensitive information (e.g., when the message
   was read, using which email client, and which OS was used).  In this
   situation, it is acceptable for the MUA to silently ignore requests
   for MDNs.

   If the Disposition-Notification-To header field is passed on
   unmodified when a message is distributed to the subscribers of a
   mailing list, the subscribers to the list may be revealed to the
   sender of the original message by the generation of MDNs.

   Headers of the original message returned in part 3 of the multipart/
   report, as well as content of the message/disposition-notification
   part, could reveal confidential information about host names and/or
   network topology inside a firewall.

   Disposition mode (<a href="#section-3.2.6.1">Section 3.2.6.1</a>) can leak information about
   recipient's MUA configuration, in particular, whether MDNs are





<span class="grey">Hansen &amp; Melnikov            Standards Track                   [Page 24]</span></pre>

   acknowledged manually or automatically.  If this is a concern, MUAs
   can return "manual-action/MDN-sent-manually" disposition mode in
   generated MDNs.

   In general, any optional MDN field may be omitted if the Reporting
   MUA site or user determines that inclusion of the field would impose
   too great a compromise of site confidentiality.  The need for such
   confidentiality must be balanced against the utility of the omitted
   information in MDNs.

   In some cases, someone with access to the message stream may use the
   MDN request mechanism to monitor the mail reading habits of a target.
   If the target is known to generate MDN reports, they could add a
   Disposition-Notification-To header field containing the envelope from
   address.  This risk can be minimized by not sending MDN's
   automatically.

   The "Reporting-UA" field (<a href="#section-3.2.1">Section 3.2.1</a>), User-Agent header field,
   and other header fields often reveal information about the respective
   sender's software systems.  In theory, this can make it easier for an
   attacker to exploit known security holes; in practice, attackers tend
   to try all potential holes regardless of the apparent software
   versions being used.  Also note that the "Reporting-UA" field doesn't
   provide any new information in comparison to the "User-Agent" and/or
   (undocumented) "X-Mailer" header fields used by many MUAs.

   The "Reporting-UA" field (<a href="#section-3.2.1">Section 3.2.1</a>) might contain enough
   information to uniquely identify a specific device, usually when
   combined with other characteristics, particularly if the user agent
   sends excessive details about the user's system or extensions.  Even
   when the guidance in <a href="#section-3.2.1">Section 3.2.1</a> is followed to avoid
   fingerprinting, other sources of unique information may still be
   present, such as the Accept-Language header fields.

   MDNs do not provide non-repudiation with proof of delivery.  Within
   the framework of today's Internet Mail, the MDNs defined in this
   document provide valuable information to the mail user; however, MDNs
   cannot be relied upon as a guarantee that a message was or was not
   seen by the recipient.  Even if MDNs are not actively forged, they
   may be lost in transit.  The recipient may bypass the MDN issuing
   mechanism in some manner.

   One possible solution for this purpose can be found in RFC-SEC-

   The MDN request mechanism introduces an additional way of mail
   bombing a mailbox.  The MDN request notification provides an address
   to which MDN's should be sent.  It is possible for an attacking agent
   to send a potentially large set of messages to otherwise unsuspecting
   third party recipients with a false Disposition-Notification-To
   address.  Automatic or simplistic processing of such requests would
   result in a flood of MDN notifications to the target of the attack.
   Additionally, as generated MDN notifications can include the full
   content of messages that caused them and thus they can be bigger than
   such messages, they can be used for bandwidth amplification attacks.
   Such an attack could overrun the storage capacity of the targeted
   mailbox and/or of the mail transport system, and deny service.

   For that reason, MDN's SHOULD NOT be sent automatically where the
   Disposition-Notification-To address is different from the SMTP "MAIL
   FROM" address (which is carried in the Return-Path header field).
   See <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a> for further discussion.

   NOTE: This section provides non-binding recommendations for the
   construction of mail gateways that wish to provide semi-transparent
   disposition notifications between the Internet and another electronic
   mail system.  Specific MDN gateway requirements for a particular pair
   of mail systems may be defined by other documents.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1.%20%20Gatewaying%20from%20Other%20Mail%20Systems%20to%20MDNs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" name="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Gatewaying from Other Mail Systems to MDNs</span>

   A mail gateway may issue an MDN to convey the contents of a "foreign"
   disposition notification over Internet Mail.  When there are
   appropriate mappings from the foreign notification elements to MDN
   fields, the information may be transmitted in those MDN fields.
   Additional information (such as what might be needed to tunnel the
   foreign notification through the Internet) may be defined in
   extension MDN fields.  (Such fields should be given names that
   identify the foreign mail protocol, e.g., X400-* for X.400 protocol
   elements [<a href="#ref-X.400" title='"Message handling system and service overview"'>X.400</a>]).

   The gateway must attempt to supply reasonable values for the
   Reporting-UA, Final-Recipient, and Disposition fields.  These will
   normally be obtained by translating the values from the foreign
   notification into their Internet-style equivalents.  However, some
   loss of information is to be expected.

   The sender-specified recipient address and the original message-id,
   if present in the foreign notification, should be preserved in the
   Original-Recipient and Original-Message-ID fields.

   The gateway should also attempt to preserve the "final" recipient
   address from the foreign system.  Whenever possible, foreign protocol
   elements should be encoded as meaningful printable ASCII strings.

   For MDNs produced from foreign disposition notifications, the name of
   the gateway MUST appear in the MDN-Gateway field of the MDN.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.2.%20%20Gatewaying%20from%20MDNs%20to%20Other%20Mail%20Systems"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" name="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Gatewaying from MDNs to Other Mail Systems</span>

   It may be possible to gateway MDNs from the Internet into a foreign
   mail system.  The primary purpose of such gatewaying is to convey
   disposition information in a form that is usable by the destination
   system.  A secondary purpose is to allow "tunneling" of MDNs through
   foreign mail systems in case the MDN may be gatewayed back into the
   Internet.

   In general, the recipient of the MDN (i.e., the sender of the
   original message) will want to know, for each recipient: the closest
   available approximation to the original recipient address and the
   disposition (displayed, printed, etc.).

   If possible, the gateway should attempt to preserve the Original-
   Recipient address and Original-Message-ID (if present) in the
   resulting foreign disposition report.

   If it is possible to tunnel an MDN through the destination
   environment, the gateway specification may define a means of
   preserving the MDN information in the disposition reports used by
   that environment.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.3.%20%20Gatewaying%20of%20MDN-Requests%20to%20Other%20Mail%20Systems"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.3" name="section-8.3">8.3</a>.  Gatewaying of MDN-Requests to Other Mail Systems</span>

   By use of the separate Disposition-Notification-To request header
   field, this specification offers a richer functionality than most, if
   not all, other email systems.  In most other email systems, the
   notification recipient is identical to the message sender as
   indicated in the "from" address.  There are two interesting cases
   when gatewaying into such systems:

   1.  If the address in the Disposition-Notification-To header field is
       identical to the address in the SMTP "MAIL FROM", the expected
       behavior will result, even if the Disposition-Notification-To
       information is lost.  Systems should propagate the MDN request.

   2.  If the address in the Disposition-Notification-To header field is
       different from the address in the SMTP "MAIL FROM", gatewaying
       into a foreign system without a separate notification address
       will result in unintended behavior.  This is especially important
       when the message arrives via a mailing list expansion software
       that may specifically replace the SMTP "MAIL FROM" address with
       an alternate address.  In such cases, the MDN request should not
       be gatewayed and should be silently dropped.  This is consistent
       with other forms of non-support for MDN.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20%20Example"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>.  Example</span>

   NOTE: This example is provided as illustration only and is not
   considered part of the MDN protocol specification.  If the example
   conflicts with the protocol definition above, the example is wrong.

   Likewise, the use of *-type subfield names or extension fields in
   this example is not to be construed as a definition for those type
   names or extension fields.

       disposition-notification media type to match what appears in
       <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> of this document and updated the reference for the
       media type to point to this document (instead of to <a href="rfc3798.html">RFC 3798</a>).

   2.  The registries specified here already exist; this section updates
       their documentation.  IANA has changed the reference document for
       the three Message Disposition Notification Parameters registries
       to point to this document (instead of to <a href="rfc3798.html">RFC 3798</a>).

   of them use the "Specification Required" IANA registration policy
   [<a href="rfc5226.html" title='"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"'>RFC5226</a>].

   The forms below are for use when registering a new disposition-
   notification-parameter name for the Disposition-Notification-Options
   header field, a new disposition modifier name, or a new MDN extension
   field.  Each piece of information required by a registration form may
   be satisfied either by providing the information on the form itself
   or by including a reference to a published and publicly available
   specification that includes the necessary information.  IANA MAY
   reject registrations because of incomplete registration forms or
   incomplete specifications.

   To register, complete the following applicable form and send it via

   Changed IANA registration for different subregistries to
   "Specification Required" to match what is already used by IANA.

   Updated IANA registration template for message/disposition-
   notification.

   "X-" fields no longer reserved for experimental use and can now be
   registered in compliance with <a href="rfc6648.html">RFC 6648</a>.

   Fixed the default MTA-name-type used in "MDN-Gateway" to be "dns".

   Strengthen requirements on obtaining user consent in order to protect
   user privacy.

   Removed discussion of using source routes with MDNs, as source route
   is a deprecated Email feature.

   The values of "dispatched" and "processed" were lost from the ABNF
   for "disposition-type".  (Erratum #691)

   Because the warning disposition modifier was previously removed, the
   warning-field has also been removed.  (Erratum #692)

   Because the failed disposition type was previously removed, the
   failure-field has also been removed.

   The ABNF for ua-name and ua-product included a semi-colon, which
   could not be distinguished from *text in the production.  The ua-name
   was restricted to not include semi-colon.  Semi-colon can still
   appear in the ua-product.

   Removed recommendation to include the MUA DNS host name in the
   "Reporting-UA" MDN field.

   The ABNF did not indicate all places that whitespace was allowable,
   in particular folding whitespace, although all implementations allow
   whitespace and folding in the header fields just like any other
   header field formatted as described in RFC-MSGFMT [<a href="rfc5322.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>].  There
   were also a number of places in the ABNF that inconsistently
   permitted comments and whitespace in one leg of the production and
   not another.  The ABNF now specifies FWS and CFWS in several places
   that should have already been specified by the grammar.

   Extension-field was defined in the collected grammar but not in the
   main text.

   The comparison of mailboxes in Disposition-Notification-To to the
   Return-Path addr-spec was clarified.

   The use of the grammar production "parameter" was confusing with the
   <a href="rfc2045.html">RFC 2045</a> [<a href="rfc2045.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>RFC2045</a>] production of the same name, as well as other uses
   of the same term.  These have been clarified.

   A clarification was added on the extent of the 7bit nature of MDNs.

   Uses of the terms "may" and "might" were clarified.

   A clarification was added on the order of the fields in the message/
   disposition-notification content.
