<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Overview</span>

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an
   application profile of the Extensible Markup Language [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)"'>XML</a>] that
   enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible data
   between any two or more network entities.  The core features of XMPP
   defined in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>] provide the building blocks for many types of
   near-real-time applications, which can be layered on top of the core
   by sending application-specific data qualified by particular XML
   namespaces (refer to [<a href="#ref-XML-NAMES">XML-NAMES</a>]).  This document defines XMPP
   extensions that provide the basic functionality expected of an
   instant messaging (IM) and presence application as described in
   [<a href="#ref-IMP-REQS">IMP-REQS</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.%20%20History"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  History</span>

   The basic syntax and semantics of XMPP were developed originally
   within the Jabber open-source community, mainly in 1999.  In late
   2002, the XMPP Working Group was chartered with developing an
   adaptation of the core Jabber protocol that would be suitable as an
   IETF IM and presence technology in accordance with [<a href="#ref-IMP-REQS">IMP-REQS</a>].  In
   October 2004, [<a href="rfc3920.html" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core"'>RFC3920</a>] and [<a href="rfc3921.html" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence"'>RFC3921</a>] were published, representing
   the most complete definition of XMPP at that time.

   Since 2004 the Internet community has gained extensive implementation
   and deployment experience with XMPP, including formal
   interoperability testing carried out under the auspices of the XMPP
   Standards Foundation (XSF).  This document incorporates comprehensive
   feedback from software developers and service providers, including a
   number of backward-compatible modifications summarized under
   <a href="#appendix-E">Appendix E</a>.  As a result, this document reflects the rough consensus
   of the Internet community regarding the IM and presence features of
   XMPP 1.0, thus obsoleting <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.%20%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Requirements</span>

   Traditionally, IM applications have combined the following factors:

   1.  The central point of focus is a list of one's contacts or
       "buddies" (in XMPP this list is called a "roster").





<span class="grey">Saint-Andre                  Standards Track                    [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-6" id="page-6" name="page-6"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6121.html">RFC 6121</a>                         XMPP IM                      March 2011</span>


   2.  The purpose of using such an application is to exchange
       relatively brief text messages with particular contacts in close
       to real time -- often relatively large numbers of such messages
       in rapid succession, in the form of a one-to-one "chat session"
       as described under <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>.

   3.  The catalyst for exchanging messages is "presence" -- i.e.,
       information about the network availability of particular contacts
       (thus knowing who is online and available for a one-to-one chat
       session).

   4.  Presence information is provided only to contacts that one has
       authorized by means of an explicit agreement called a "presence
       subscription".

   Thus at a high level this document assumes that a user needs to be
   able to complete the following use cases:

   o  Manage items in one's contact list

   o  Exchange messages with one's contacts

   o  Exchange presence information with one's contacts

   o  Manage presence subscriptions to and from one's contacts

   Detailed definitions of these functionality areas are contained in
   <a href="rfc2779.html">RFC 2779</a> [<a href="#ref-IMP-REQS">IMP-REQS</a>], and the interested reader is referred to that
   document regarding in-depth requirements.  Although the XMPP IM and
   presence extensions specified herein meet the requirements of <a href="rfc2779.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc2779.html">2779</a>, they were not designed explicitly with that specification in
   mind, since the base protocol evolved through an open development
   process within the Jabber open-source community before <a href="rfc2779.html">RFC 2779</a> was
   written.  Although XMPP protocol extensions addressing many other
   functionality areas have been defined in the XMPP Standards
   Foundation's XEP series (e.g., multi-user text chat as specified in

      Implementation Note: <a href="rfc2779.html">RFC 2779</a> stipulates that presence services
      must be separable from IM services and vice-versa; i.e., it must
      be possible to use the protocol to provide a presence service, a

      assumes that implementations and deployments will want to offer a

   This non-normative section provides a developer-friendly, functional
   summary of XMPP-based IM and presence features; consult the sections
   that follow for a normative definition of these features.

   [<a id="ref-XMPP-CORE" name="ref-XMPP-CORE">XMPP-CORE</a>] specifies how an XMPP client connects to an XMPP server.
   In particular, it specifies the preconditions that need to be
   fulfilled before a client is allowed to send XML stanzas (the basic
   unit of meaning in XMPP) to other entities on an XMPP network.  These
   preconditions comprise negotiation of the XML stream and include
   exchange of XML stream headers, optional channel encryption via
   Transport Layer Security [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>TLS</a>], mandatory authentication via Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer [<a href="#ref-SASL" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>SASL</a>], and binding of a resource
   to the stream for client addressing.  The reader is referred to
   [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>] for details regarding these preconditions, and knowledge
   of [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>] is assumed herein.

      Interoperability Note: [<a href="rfc3921.html" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence"'>RFC3921</a>] specified one additional
      precondition: formal establishment of an instant messaging and
      presence session.  Implementation and deployment experience has
      shown that this additional step is unnecessary.  However, for
      backward compatibility an implementation MAY still offer that
      feature.  This enables older software to connect while letting
      newer software save a round trip.

   Upon fulfillment of the preconditions specified in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>], an
   XMPP client has a long-lived XML stream with an XMPP server, which
   enables the user controlling that client to send and receive a
   potentially unlimited number of XML stanzas over the stream.  Such a
   stream can be used to exchange messages, share presence information,
   and engage in structured request-response interactions in close to
   real time.  After negotiation of the XML stream, the typical flow for
   an instant messaging and presence session is as follows:

   1.  Retrieve one's roster.  (See <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>.)

   2.  Send initial presence to the server for broadcast to all
       subscribed contacts, thus "going online" from the perspective of
       XMPP communication.  (See <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.)

   3.  Exchange messages, manage presence subscriptions, perform roster
       updates, and in general process and generate other XML stanzas
       with particular semantics throughout the life of the session.
       (See Sections <a href="#section-5">5</a>, <a href="#section-3">3</a>, <a href="#section-2">2</a>, and <a href="#section-6">6</a>.)

   4.  Terminate the session when desired by sending unavailable
       presence and closing the underlying XML stream.  (See
       <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>.)

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc2119.html">2119</a> [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS">KEYWORDS</a>].

   This document inherits the terminology defined in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>].

   The terms "automated client" and "interactive client" are to be
   understood in the sense defined in [<a href="#ref-TLS-CERTS">TLS-CERTS</a>].

   For convenience, this document employs the term "user" to refer to
   the owner of an XMPP account; however, account owners need not be
   humans and can be bots, devices, or other automated applications.

   Several other terms, such as "interested resource", are defined
   within the body of this document.

   Following the "XML Notation" used in [<a href="#ref-IRI" title='"Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)"'>IRI</a>] to represent characters
   that cannot be rendered in ASCII-only documents, some examples in
   this document use the form "&amp;#x...." as a notational device to
   represent [<a href="#ref-UNICODE" title='"The Unicode Standard, Version 6.0"'>UNICODE</a>] characters (e.g., the string "&amp;#x0159;" stands
   for the Unicode character LATIN SMALL LETTER R WITH CARON); this form
   is definitely not to be sent over the wire in XMPP systems.

   In examples, lines have been wrapped for improved readability,
   "[...]" means elision, and the following prepended strings are used
   (these prepended strings are not to be sent over the wire):

   o  C: = client

   o  CC: = contact's client

   o  CS: = contact's server

   o  S: = server

   o  UC: = user's client

   Readers need to be aware that the examples are not exhaustive and
   that, in examples for some protocol flows, the alternate steps shown
   would not necessarily be triggered by the exact data sent in the
   previous step; in all cases, the protocol definitions specified in

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Managing%20the%20Roster"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Managing the Roster</span>

   In XMPP, a user's roster contains any number of specific contacts.  A
   user's roster is stored by the user's server on the user's behalf so
   that the user can access roster information from any device.  When
   the user adds items to the roster or modifies existing items, if an
   error does not occur then the server SHOULD store that data
   unmodified if at all possible and MUST return the data it has stored
   when an authorized client requests the roster.

      Security Warning: Because the user's roster can contain
      confidential data, the server MUST restrict access to this data so
      that only authorized entities (typically limited to the account
      owner) are able to retrieve, modify, or delete it.

   <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a> assumed that the only place where a user stores their roster
   is the server where the user's account is registered and at which the
   user authenticates for access to the XMPP network.  This
   specification removes that strict coupling of roster storage to
   account registration and network authentication, with the result that
   a user could store their roster at another location, or could have
   multiple rosters that are stored in multiple locations.  However, in
   the absence of implementation and deployment experience with a more
   flexible roster storage model, this specification retains the
   terminology of <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a> by using the terms "client" and "server" (and
   "the roster" instead of "a roster"), rather than coining a new term
   for "a place where a user stores a roster".  Future documents might
   provide normative rules for non-server roster storage or for the
   management of multiple rosters, but such rules are out of scope for
   this document.

   Rosters are managed using &lt;iq/&gt; stanzas (see Section 8.2.3 of
   [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>]), specifically by means of a &lt;query/&gt; child element
   qualified by the 'jabber:iq:roster' namespace.  The detailed syntax
   and semantics are defined in the following sections.

   The 'ver' attribute is a string that identifies a particular version
   of the roster information.  The value MUST be generated only by the
   server and MUST be treated by the client as opaque.  The server can
   use any appropriate method for generating the version ID, such as a
   hash of the roster data or a strictly increasing sequence number.

   Inclusion of the 'ver' attribute is RECOMMENDED.

   Use of the 'ver' attribute is described more fully under <a href="#section-2.6">Section 2.6</a>.

      Interoperability Note: The 'ver' attribute of the &lt;query/&gt; element
      was not defined in <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a> and is newly defined in this
      specification.

   The &lt;query/&gt; element inside a roster set (<a href="#section-2.1.5">Section 2.1.5</a>) contains one
   &lt;item/&gt; child, and a roster result (<a href="#section-2.1.4">Section 2.1.4</a>) typically contains
   multiple &lt;item/&gt; children.  Each &lt;item/&gt; element describes a unique
   "roster item" (sometimes also called a "contact").

   The syntax of the &lt;item/&gt; element is described in the following
   sections.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.2.1.%20%20Approved%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.2.1" name="section-2.1.2.1">2.1.2.1</a>.  Approved Attribute</span>

   The boolean 'approved' attribute with a value of "true" is used to
   signal subscription pre-approval as described under <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a> (the
   default is "false", in accordance with [<a href="#ref-XML-DATATYPES">XML-DATATYPES</a>]).

   A server SHOULD include the 'approved' attribute to inform the client
   of subscription pre-approvals.  A client MUST NOT include the
   'approved' attribute in the roster sets it sends to the server, but
   instead MUST use presence stanzas of type "subscribed" and
   "unsubscribed" to manage pre-approvals as described under
   <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.

      Interoperability Note: The 'approved' attribute of the &lt;item/&gt;

   The 'ask' attribute of the &lt;item/&gt; element with a value of
   "subscribe" is used to signal various subscription sub-states that
   include a "Pending Out" aspect as described under <a href="#section-3.1.2">Section 3.1.2</a>.

   A server SHOULD include the 'ask' attribute to inform the client of
   "Pending Out" sub-states.  A client MUST NOT include the 'ask'
   attribute in the roster sets it sends to the server, but instead MUST
   use presence stanzas of type "subscribe" and "unsubscribe" to manage

   The 'jid' attribute of the &lt;item/&gt; element specifies the Jabber
   Identifier (JID) that uniquely identifies the roster item.

   The 'jid' attribute is REQUIRED whenever a client or server adds,
   updates, deletes, or returns a roster item.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.2.4.%20%20Name%20Attribute"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.2.4" name="section-2.1.2.4">2.1.2.4</a>.  Name Attribute</span>

   The 'name' attribute of the &lt;item/&gt; element specifies the "handle" to
   be associated with the JID, as determined by the user (not the
   contact).  Although the value of the 'name' attribute MAY have
   meaning to a human user, it is opaque to the server.  However, the
   'name' attribute MAY be used by the server for matching purposes
   within the context of various XMPP extensions (one possible
   comparison method is that described for XMPP resourceparts in
   [<a href="#ref-XMPP-ADDR">XMPP-ADDR</a>]).

   It is OPTIONAL for a client to include the 'name' attribute when
   adding or updating a roster item.

   The state of the presence subscription is captured in the
   'subscription' attribute of the &lt;item/&gt; element.  The defined
   subscription-related values are:

   none:  the user does not have a subscription to the contact's
      presence, and the contact does not have a subscription to the
      user's presence; this is the default value, so if the subscription
      attribute is not included then the state is to be understood as
      "none"

   to:  the user has a subscription to the contact's presence, but the
      contact does not have a subscription to the user's presence

   from:  the contact has a subscription to the user's presence, but the
      user does not have a subscription to the contact's presence

   both:  the user and the contact have subscriptions to each other's
      presence (also called a "mutual subscription")

   In a roster result (<a href="#section-2.1.4">Section 2.1.4</a>), the client MUST ignore values of
   the 'subscription' attribute other than "none", "to", "from", or

   In a roster push (<a href="#section-2.1.6">Section 2.1.6</a>), the client MUST ignore values of
   the 'subscription' attribute other than "none", "to", "from", "both",
   or "remove".

   In a roster set (<a href="#section-2.1.5">Section 2.1.5</a>), the 'subscription' attribute MAY be
   included with a value of "remove", which indicates that the item is
   to be removed from the roster; in a roster set the server MUST ignore
   all values of the 'subscription' attribute other than "remove".

   Inclusion of the 'subscription' attribute is OPTIONAL.

   The &lt;group/&gt; child element specifies a category or "bucket" into
   which the roster item is to be grouped by a client.  An &lt;item/&gt;
   element MAY contain more than one &lt;group/&gt; element, which means that
   roster groups are not exclusive.  Although the XML character data of
   the &lt;group/&gt; element MAY have meaning to a human user, it is opaque
   to the server.  However, the &lt;group/&gt; element MAY be used by the
   server for matching purposes within the context of various XMPP
   extensions (one possible comparison method is that described for XMPP
   resourceparts in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-ADDR">XMPP-ADDR</a>]).

   It is OPTIONAL for a client to include the &lt;group/&gt; element when
   adding or updating a roster item.  If a roster set (<a href="#section-2.1.5">Section 2.1.5</a>)
   includes no &lt;group/&gt; element, then the item is to be interpreted as
   being affiliated with no group.

   A "roster get" is a client's request for the server to return the
   roster; syntactically it is an IQ stanza of type "get" sent from
   client to server and containing a &lt;query/&gt; element qualified by the
   'jabber:iq:roster' namespace, where the &lt;query/&gt; element MUST NOT
   contain any &lt;item/&gt; child elements.

          type='get'&gt;
       &lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'/&gt;
     &lt;/iq&gt;

   The expected outcome of sending a roster get is for the server to
   return a roster result.

   A "roster result" is the server's response to a roster get;
   syntactically it is an IQ stanza of type "result" sent from server to
   client and containing a &lt;query/&gt; element qualified by the 'jabber:iq:
   roster' namespace.

   The &lt;query/&gt; element in a roster result contains one &lt;item/&gt; element
   for each contact and therefore can contain more than one &lt;item/&gt;
   element.

   S: &lt;iq id='bv1bs71f'

       &lt;/query&gt;
     &lt;/iq&gt;

   If the roster exists but there are no contacts in the roster, then
   the server MUST return an IQ-result containing a child &lt;query/&gt;
   element that in turn contains no &lt;item/&gt; children (i.e., the server
   MUST NOT return an empty &lt;iq/&gt; stanza of type "error").

       &lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster' ver='ver9'/&gt;

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.5.%20%20Roster%20Set"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.5" name="section-2.1.5">2.1.5</a>.  Roster Set</span>

   A "roster set" is a client's request for the server to modify (i.e.,
   create, update, or delete) a roster item; syntactically it is an IQ
   stanza of type "set" sent from client to server and containing a
   &lt;query/&gt; element qualified by the 'jabber:iq:roster' namespace.

   The following rules apply to roster sets:

   1.  The &lt;query/&gt; element MUST contain one and only one &lt;item/&gt;
       element.

   2.  The server MUST ignore any value of the 'subscription' attribute
       other than "remove" (see <a href="#section-2.1.2.5">Section 2.1.2.5</a>).

      Security Warning: Traditionally, the IQ stanza of the roster set
      included no 'to' address, with the result that all roster sets
      were sent from an authenticated resource (full JID) of the account
      whose roster was being updated.  Furthermore, <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a> required a
      server to perform special-case checking of roster sets to ignore
      the 'to' address; however, this specification has removed that
      special-casing, which means that a roster set might include a 'to'
      address other than that of the sender.  Therefore, the entity that
      processes a roster set MUST verify that the sender of the roster
      set is authorized to update the roster, and if not return a
      &lt;forbidden/&gt; error.

   A "roster push" is a newly created, updated, or deleted roster item
   that is sent from the server to the client; syntactically it is an IQ
   stanza of type "set" sent from server to client and containing a
   &lt;query/&gt; element qualified by the 'jabber:iq:roster' namespace.

   The following rules apply to roster pushes:

   1.  The &lt;query/&gt; element in a roster push MUST contain one and only
       one &lt;item/&gt; element.

   2.  A receiving client MUST ignore the stanza unless it has no 'from'
       attribute (i.e., implicitly from the bare JID of the user's
       account) or it has a 'from' attribute whose value matches the
       user's bare JID &lt;user@domainpart&gt;.

         &lt;item jid='nurse@example.com'/&gt;
       &lt;/query&gt;
     &lt;/iq&gt;

   As mandated by the semantics of the IQ stanza as defined in
   [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>], each resource that receives a roster push from the
   server is supposed to reply with an IQ stanza of type "result" or
   "error" (however, it is known that many existing clients do not reply
   to roster pushes).

   C: &lt;iq from='juliet@example.com/balcony'
          id='a78b4q6ha463'

   C: &lt;iq from='juliet@example.com/chamber'
          id='a78b4q6ha463'
          type='result'/&gt;

      Security Warning: Traditionally, a roster push included no 'from'
      address, with the result that all roster pushes were sent
      implicitly from the bare JID of the account itself.  However, this
      specification allows entities other than the user's server to
      maintain roster information, which means that a roster push might
      include a 'from' address other than the bare JID of the user's
      account.  Therefore, the client MUST check the 'from' address to
      verify that the sender of the roster push is authorized to update
      the roster.  If the client receives a roster push from an
      unauthorized entity, it MUST NOT process the pushed data; in
      addition, the client can either return a stanza error of &lt;service-
      unavailable/&gt; error or refuse to return a stanza error at all (the
      latter behavior overrides a MUST-level requirement from
      [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>] for the purpose of preventing a presence leak).

      Implementation Note: There is no error case for client processing
      of roster pushes; if the server receives an IQ of type "error" in
      response to a roster push then it SHOULD ignore the error.

   Upon authenticating with a server and binding a resource (thus
   becoming a connected resource as defined in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>]), a client
   SHOULD request the roster before sending initial presence (however,
   because receiving the roster is not necessarily desirable for all
   resources, e.g., a connection with limited bandwidth, the client's
   request for the roster is not mandatory).  After a connected resource
   sends initial presence (see <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>), it is referred to as an
   "available resource".  If a connected resource or available resource
   requests the roster, it is referred to as an "interested resource".
   The server MUST send roster pushes to all interested resources.

      Implementation Note: Presence subscription requests are sent to
      available resources, whereas the roster pushes associated with
      subscription state changes are sent to interested resources.
      Therefore, if a resource wishes to receive both subscription
      requests and roster pushes, it MUST both send initial presence and
      request the roster.

   A client requests the roster by sending a roster get over its stream
   with the server.

   If the server cannot process the roster get, it MUST return an

   At any time, a client can add an item to the roster.  This is done by

   If the server can successfully process the roster set for the new
   item (i.e., if no error occurs), it MUST create the item in the
   user's roster and proceed as follows.

   The server MUST return an IQ stanza of type "result" to the connected
   resource that sent the roster set.

   S: &lt;iq id='ph1xaz53'
          to='juliet@example.com/balcony'
          type='result'/&gt;

   The server MUST also send a roster push containing the new roster
   item to all of the user's interested resources, including the
   resource that generated the roster set.

   If the server cannot successfully process the roster set, it MUST

   Naturally, other stanza errors can occur, such as &lt;internal-server-
   error/&gt; if the server experiences an internal problem with processing
   the roster get, or even &lt;not-allowed/&gt; if the server only allows
   roster modifications by means of a non-XMPP method such as a web
   interface.

   The server MUST return a &lt;forbidden/&gt; stanza error to the client if
   the sender of the roster set is not authorized to update the roster
   (where typically only an authenticated resource of the account itself
   is authorized).

   The server MUST return a &lt;bad-request/&gt; stanza error to the client if
   the roster set contains any of the following violations:

   1.  The &lt;query/&gt; element contains more than one &lt;item/&gt; child
       element.

   2.  The &lt;item/&gt; element contains more than one &lt;group/&gt; element, but
       there are duplicate groups (one possible comparison method for
       determining duplicates is that described for XMPP resourceparts
       in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-ADDR">XMPP-ADDR</a>]).

   The server MUST return a &lt;not-acceptable/&gt; stanza error to the client
   if the roster set contains any of the following violations:

   1.  The length of the 'name' attribute is greater than a server-
       configured limit.

   2.  The XML character data of the &lt;group/&gt; element is of zero length
       (to remove an item from all groups, the client instead needs to
       exclude any &lt;group/&gt; element from the roster set).

   3.  The XML character data of the &lt;group/&gt; element is larger than a
       server-configured limit.

   Updating an existing roster item is done in the same way as adding a
   new roster item, i.e., by sending a roster set to the server.
   Because a roster item is atomic, the item MUST be updated exactly as
   provided in the roster set.

   There are several reasons why a client might update a roster item:

   1.  Adding a group

   2.  Deleting a group

   3.  Changing the handle

   4.  Deleting the handle

   Consider a roster item that is defined as follows:

       &lt;item jid='romeo@example.net'
             name='Romeo'&gt;
         &lt;group&gt;Friends&lt;/group&gt;
       &lt;/item&gt;

   The user who has this item in her roster might want to add the item
   to another group.

   C: &lt;iq from='juliet@example.com/balcony'
          id='di43b2x9'
          type='set'&gt;
        &lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'&gt;
          &lt;item jid='romeo@example.net'
                name='Romeo'&gt;
            &lt;group&gt;Friends&lt;/group&gt;
            &lt;group&gt;Lovers&lt;/group&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/query&gt;
      &lt;/iq&gt;

   Sometime later, the user might want to remove the item from the
   original group.

   C: &lt;iq from='juliet@example.com/balcony'
          id='lf72v157'
          type='set'&gt;
        &lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'&gt;
          &lt;item jid='romeo@example.net'
                name='Romeo'&gt;
            &lt;group&gt;Lovers&lt;/group&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/query&gt;
      &lt;/iq&gt;

   The user might want to remove the item from all groups.

   C: &lt;iq from='juliet@example.com/balcony'
          id='ju4b62a5'
          type='set'&gt;
        &lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'&gt;
          &lt;item jid='romeo@example.net'/&gt;
        &lt;/query&gt;
      &lt;/iq&gt;

   The user might also want to change the handle for the item.

      equivalent to including no 'name' attribute; both actions set the

   At any time, a client can delete an item from his or her roster by
   sending a roster set and specifying a value of "remove" for the
   'subscription' attribute.

   In addition, the user's server might need to generate one or more
   subscription-related presence stanzas, as follows:

   1.  If the user has a presence subscription to the contact, then the
       user's server MUST send a presence stanza of type "unsubscribe"
       to the contact (in order to unsubscribe from the contact's
       presence).

   2.  If the contact has a presence subscription to the user, then the
       user's server MUST send a presence stanza of type "unsubscribed"
       to the contact (in order to cancel the contact's subscription to
       the user).

   3.  If the presence subscription is mutual, then the user's server
       MUST send both a presence stanza of type "unsubscribe" and a
       presence stanza of type "unsubscribed" to the contact.

   If a server supports roster versioning, then it MUST advertise the

   The roster versioning stream feature is merely informative and

   If a client supports roster versioning and the server to which it has
   connected advertises support for roster versioning as described in
   the foregoing section, then the client SHOULD include the 'ver'
   element in its request for the roster.  If the server does not
   advertise support for roster versioning, the client MUST NOT include
   the 'ver' attribute.  If the client includes the 'ver' attribute in
   its roster get, it sets the attribute's value to the version ID
   associated with its last cache of the roster.

   If the client has not yet cached the roster or the cache is lost or
   corrupted, but the client wishes to bootstrap the use of roster
   versioning, it MUST set the 'ver' attribute to the empty string
   (i.e., ver="").

   Naturally, if the client does not support roster versioning or does
   not wish to bootstrap the use of roster versioning, it will not
   include the 'ver' attribute.

   Whether or not the roster has been modified since the version ID
   enumerated by the client, the server MUST either return the complete
   roster as described under <a href="#section-2.1.4">Section 2.1.4</a> (including a 'ver' attribute
   that signals the latest version) or return an empty IQ-result (thus
   indicating that any roster modifications will be sent via roster
   pushes, as described below).  In general, unless returning the
   complete roster would (1) use less bandwidth than sending individual
   roster pushes to the client (e.g., if the roster contains only a few
   items) or (2) the server cannot associate the version ID with any
   previous version it has on file, the server SHOULD send an empty IQ-
   result and then send the modifications (if any) via roster pushes.

      Implementation Note: This empty IQ-result is different from an
      empty &lt;query/&gt; element, thus disambiguating this usage from an
      empty roster.

   If roster versioning is enabled and the roster has not been modified
   since the version ID enumerated by the client, the server will simply
   not send any roster pushes to the client (until and unless some
   relevant event triggers a roster push during the lifetime of the
   client's session).

   If the roster has been modified since the version ID enumerated by
   the client, the server MUST then send one roster push to the client
   for each roster item that has been modified since the version ID
   enumerated by the client.  (We call a roster push that is sent for
   purposes of roster version synchronization an "interim roster push".)

      Definition: A "roster modification" is any change to the roster
      data that would result in a roster push to a connected client.
      Therefore, internal states related to roster processing within the
      server that would not result in a roster push to a connected
      client do not necessitate a change to the version.

      &lt;/iq&gt;

   These "interim roster pushes" can be understood as follows:

   1.  Imagine that the client had an active presence session for the
       entire time between its cached roster version (say, "ver14") and
       the new roster version (say, "ver96").

   2.  During that time, the client might have received roster pushes
       related to various roster versions (which might have been, say,
       "ver51" and "ver79").  However, some of those roster pushes might
       have contained intermediate updates to the same roster item
       (e.g., modifications to the subscription state for
       bill@example.org from "none" to "to" and from "to" to "both").

   3.  The interim roster pushes would not include all of the
       intermediate steps, only the final result of all modifications
       applied to each item while the client was in fact offline (which
       might have been, say, "ver34", "ver42", "ver72", and "ver96").

   The client MUST handle an "interim roster push" in the same way it
   handles any roster push (indeed, from the client's perspective it
   cannot tell the difference between an "interim" roster push and a
   "live" roster push and therefore it has no way of knowing when it has
   received all of the interim roster pushes).  When requesting the
   roster after reconnection, the client SHOULD request the version
   associated with the last roster push it received during its previous
   session, not the version associated with the roster result it
   received at the start of its previous session.

   When roster versioning is enabled, the server MUST include the
   updated roster version with each roster push.  Roster pushes MUST
   occur in order of modification and the version contained in a roster
   push MUST be unique.  Even if the client has not included the 'ver'
   attribute in its roster gets or sets, the server SHOULD include the
   'ver' attribute on all roster pushes and results that it sends to the
   client.

   In order to protect the privacy of XMPP users, presence information
   is disclosed only to other entities that a user has approved.  When a
   user has agreed that another entity is allowed to view its presence,
   the entity is said to have a "subscription" to the user's presence.
   An entity that has a subscription to a user's presence or to which a
   user has a presence subscription is called a "contact" (in this
   document the term "contact" is also used in a less strict sense to
   refer to a potential contact or any item in a user's roster).

   In XMPP, a subscription lasts across presence sessions; indeed, it
   lasts until the contact unsubscribes or the user cancels the
   previously granted subscription.  (This model is different from that
   used for presence subscriptions in the Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP), as defined in [<a href="#ref-SIP-PRES">SIP-PRES</a>].)

   Subscriptions are managed within XMPP by sending presence stanzas
   containing specially defined attributes ("subscribe", "unsubscribe",
   "subscribed", and "unsubscribed").

      Implementation Note: When a server processes or generates an
      outbound presence stanza of type "subscribe", "subscribed",
      "unsubscribe", or "unsubscribed", the server MUST stamp the
      outgoing presence stanza with the bare JID &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt;
      of the sending entity, not the full JID
      &lt;localpart@domainpart/resourcepart&gt;.  Enforcement of this rule
      simplifies the presence subscription model and helps to prevent
      presence leaks; for information about presence leaks, refer to the
      security considerations of [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>].

   Subscription states are reflected in the rosters of both the user and
   the contact.  This section does not cover every possible case related
   to presence subscriptions, and mainly narrates the protocol flows for
   bootstrapping a mutual subscription between a user and a contact.
   Complete details regarding subscription states can be found under
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

   A "subscription request" is a request from a user for authorization
   to permanently subscribe to a contact's presence information;
   syntactically it is a presence stanza whose 'type' attribute has a
   value of "subscribe".  A subscription request is generated by a

   user's client, processed by the (potential) contact's server, and
   acted on by the contact via the contact's client.  The workflow is
   described in the following sections.

      Implementation Note: Presence subscription requests are sent to
      available resources, whereas the roster pushes associated with
      subscription state changes are sent to interested resources.
      Therefore, if a resource wishes to receive both subscription
      requests and roster pushes, it MUST both send initial presence and
      request the roster.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.1.%20%20Client%20Generation%20of%20Outbound%20Subscription%20Request"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" name="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Client Generation of Outbound Subscription Request</span>

   A user's client generates a subscription request by sending a
   presence stanza of type "subscribe" and specifying a 'to' address of
   the potential contact's bare JID &lt;contact@domainpart&gt;.

   UC: &lt;presence id='xk3h1v69'
                 to='juliet@example.com'
                 type='subscribe'/&gt;

   When a user sends a presence subscription request to a potential
   instant messaging and presence contact, the value of the 'to'
   attribute MUST be a bare JID &lt;contact@domainpart&gt; rather than a full
   JID &lt;contact@domainpart/resourcepart&gt;, since the desired result is
   for the user to receive presence from all of the contact's resources,
   not merely the particular resource specified in the 'to' attribute.
   Use of bare JIDs also simplifies subscription processing, presence
   probes, and presence notifications by the user's server and the
   contact's server.

   For tracking purposes, a client SHOULD include an 'id' attribute in a
   presence subscription request.

      Implementation Note: Many XMPP clients prompt the user for
      information about the potential contact (e.g., "handle" and
      desired roster group) when generating an outbound presence
      subscription request and therefore send a roster set before
      sending the outbound presence subscription request.  This behavior
      is OPTIONAL, because a client MAY instead wait until receiving the
      initial roster push from the server before uploading user-provided
      information about the contact.  A server MUST process a roster set
      and outbound presence subscription request in either order (i.e.,
      in whatever order generated by the client).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.2.%20%20Server%20Processing%20of%20Outbound%20Subscription%20Request"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.2" name="section-3.1.2">3.1.2</a>.  Server Processing of Outbound Subscription Request</span>

   Upon receiving the outbound presence subscription request, the user's
   server MUST proceed as follows.

   1.  Before processing the request, the user's server MUST check the
       syntax of the JID contained in the 'to' attribute (however, it is
       known that some existing implementations do not perform this
       check).  If the JID is of the form
       &lt;contact@domainpart/resourcepart&gt; instead of
       &lt;contact@domainpart&gt;, the user's server SHOULD treat it as if the
       request had been directed to the contact's bare JID and modify
       the 'to' address accordingly.  The server MAY also verify that
       the JID adheres to the format defined in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-ADDR">XMPP-ADDR</a>] and possibly
       return a &lt;jid-malformed/&gt; stanza error.

   2.  If the potential contact is hosted on the same server as the
       user, then the server MUST adhere to the rules specified under
       <a href="#section-3.1.3">Section 3.1.3</a> when processing the subscription request and
       delivering it to the (local) contact.

   3.  If the potential contact is hosted on a remote server, subject to
       local service policies the user's server MUST then route the
       stanza to that remote domain in accordance with core XMPP stanza
       processing rules.  (This can result in returning an appropriate
       stanza error to the user, such as &lt;remote-server-timeout/&gt;.)

   As mentioned, before locally delivering or remotely routing the
   presence subscription request, the user's server MUST stamp the
   outbound subscription request with the bare JID &lt;user@domainpart&gt; of
   the user.

   US: &lt;presence from='romeo@example.net'
                 id='xk3h1v69'
                 to='juliet@example.com'
                 type='subscribe'/&gt;

   If the presence subscription request cannot be locally delivered or
   remotely routed (e.g., because the request is malformed, the local
   contact does not exist, the remote server does not exist, an attempt
   to contact the remote server times out, or any other error is
   determined or experienced by the user's server), then the user's
   server MUST return an appropriate error stanza to the user.  An
   example follows.

   US: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com'

         &lt;/error&gt;
       &lt;/presence&gt;

   After locally delivering or remotely routing the presence
   subscription request, the user's server MUST then send a roster push
   to all of the user's interested resources, containing the potential
   contact with a subscription state of "none" and with notation that
   the subscription is pending (via an 'ask' attribute whose value is
   "subscribe").

   US: &lt;iq id='b89c5r7ib574'
           to='romeo@example.net/foo'
           type='set'&gt;
         &lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'&gt;
           &lt;item ask='subscribe'
                 jid='juliet@example.com'
                 subscription='none'/&gt;
         &lt;/query&gt;
       &lt;/iq&gt;

   US: &lt;iq id='b89c5r7ib575'
           to='romeo@example.net/bar'
           type='set'&gt;
         &lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'&gt;
           &lt;item ask='subscribe'
                 jid='juliet@example.com'
                 subscription='none'/&gt;
         &lt;/query&gt;
       &lt;/iq&gt;

   If a remote contact does not approve or deny the subscription request
   within some configurable amount of time, the user's server SHOULD
   resend the subscription request to the contact based on an
   implementation-specific algorithm (e.g., whenever a new resource
   becomes available for the user, or after a certain amount of time has
   elapsed); this helps to recover from transient, silent errors that
   might have occurred when the original subscription request was routed
   to the remote domain.  When doing so, it is RECOMMENDED for the
   server to include an 'id' attribute so that it can track responses to
   the resent subscription request.

   Before processing the inbound presence subscription request, the
   contact's server SHOULD check the syntax of the JID contained in the
   'to' attribute.  If the JID is of the form
   &lt;contact@domainpart/resourcepart&gt; instead of &lt;contact@domainpart&gt;,
   the contact's server SHOULD treat it as if the request had been
   directed to the contact's bare JID and modify the 'to' address
   accordingly.  The server MAY also verify that the JID adheres to the
   format defined in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-ADDR">XMPP-ADDR</a>] and possibly return a &lt;jid-malformed/&gt;
   stanza error.

   When processing the inbound presence subscription request, the
   contact's server MUST adhere to the following rules:

   1.  Above all, the contact's server MUST NOT automatically approve
       subscription requests on the contact's behalf -- unless the
       contact has (a) pre-approved subscription requests from the user
       as described under <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>, (b) configured its account to
       automatically approve subscription requests, or (c) accepted an
       agreement with its service provider that allows automatic
       approval (for instance, via an employment agreement within an
       enterprise deployment).  Instead, if a subscription request
       requires approval then the contact's server MUST deliver that
       request to the contact's available resource(s) for approval or
       denial by the contact.

   2.  If the contact exists and the user already has a subscription to
       the contact's presence, then the contact's server MUST auto-reply
       on behalf of the contact by sending a presence stanza of type
       "subscribed" from the contact's bare JID to the user's bare JID.
       Likewise, if the contact previously sent a presence stanza of
       type "subscribed" and the contact's server treated that as
       indicating "pre-approval" for the user's presence subscription
       (see <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>), then the contact's server SHOULD also auto-
       reply on behalf of the contact.

   CS: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com'
                 id='xk3h1v69'
                 to='romeo@example.net'
                 type='subscribed'/&gt;

   3.  Otherwise, if there is at least one available resource associated
       with the contact when the subscription request is received by the
       contact's server, then the contact's server MUST send that
       subscription request to all available resources in accordance
       with <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.  As a way of acknowledging receipt of the
       presence subscription request, the contact's server MAY send a

       presence stanza of type "unavailable" from the bare JID of the
       contact to the bare JID of the user (the user's client MUST NOT
       assume that this acknowledgement provides presence information
       about the contact, since it comes from the contact's bare JID and
       is received before the subscription request has been approved).

   4.  Otherwise, if the contact has no available resources when the
       subscription request is received by the contact's server, then
       the contact's server MUST keep a record of the complete presence
       stanza comprising the subscription request, including any
       extended content contained therein (see Section 8.4 of
       [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>]), and then deliver the request when the contact next
       has an available resource.  The contact's server MUST continue to
       deliver the subscription request whenever the contact creates an
       available resource, until the contact either approves or denies
       the request.  (The contact's server MUST NOT deliver more than
       one subscription request from any given user when the contact
       next has an available resource; e.g., if the user sends multiple
       subscription requests to the contact while the contact is
       offline, the contact's server SHOULD store only one of those
       requests, such as the first request or last request, and MUST
       deliver only one of the requests when the contact next has an
       available resource; this helps to prevent "subscription request
       spam".)

      Security Warning: Until and unless the contact approves the
      subscription request as described under <a href="#section-3.1.4">Section 3.1.4</a>, the
      contact's server MUST NOT add an item for the user to the
      contact's roster.

      Security Warning: The mandate for the contact's server to store
      the complete stanza of the presence subscription request
      introduces the possibility of an application resource exhaustion
      attack (see Section 2.1.2 of [<a href="#ref-DOS" title='"Internet Denial-of- Service Considerations"'>DOS</a>]), for example, by a rogue
      server or a coordinated group of users (e.g., a botnet) against
      the contact's server or particular contact.  Server implementers
      are advised to consider the possibility of such attacks and
      provide tools for counteracting it, such as enabling service
      administrators to set limits on the number or size of inbound
      presence subscription requests that the server will store in
      aggregate or for any given contact.

   subscription requests as described above.  An automated client that
   is not controlled by a natural person will have its own application-
   specific rules for approving or denying subscription requests.

   A client approves a subscription request by sending a presence stanza
   of type "subscribed", which is processed as described under
   <a href="#section-3.1.5">Section 3.1.5</a> for the contact's server and <a href="#section-3.1.6">Section 3.1.6</a> for the

                 to='romeo@example.net'
                 type='subscribed'/&gt;

   A client denies a subscription request by sending a presence stanza
   of type "unsubscribed", which is processed as described under
   <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> for both the contact's server and the user's server.

   CC: &lt;presence id='tb2m1b59'
                 to='romeo@example.net'
                 type='unsubscribed'/&gt;

   For tracking purposes, a client SHOULD include an 'id' attribute in a
   subscription approval or subscription denial; this 'id' attribute
   MUST NOT mirror the 'id' attribute of the subscription request.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.5.%20%20Server%20Processing%20of%20Outbound%20Subscription%20Approval"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.5" name="section-3.1.5">3.1.5</a>.  Server Processing of Outbound Subscription Approval</span>

   When the contact's client sends the subscription approval, the
   contact's server MUST stamp the outbound stanza with the bare JID
   &lt;contact@domainpart&gt; of the contact and locally deliver or remotely
   route the stanza to the user.

   the contact's interested resources, with the 'subscription' attribute
   set to a value of "from".  (Here we assume that the contact does not
   already have a subscription to the user; if that were the case, the
   'subscription' attribute would be set to a value of "both", as
   explained under <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.)

                 subscription='from'/&gt;
         &lt;/query&gt;
       &lt;/iq&gt;

   From the perspective of the contact, there now exists a subscription
   from the user, which is why the 'subscription' attribute is set to a
   value of "from".  (Here we assume that the contact does not already
   have a subscription to the user; if that were the case, the
   'subscription' attribute would be set to a value of "both", as
   explained under <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.)

   The contact's server MUST then also send current presence to the user
   from each of the contact's available resources.

   CS: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com/balcony'
                 id='pw72bc5j'
                 to='romeo@example.net'/&gt;

   CS: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com/chamber'
                 id='ux31da4q'
                 to='romeo@example.net'/&gt;

   In order to subscribe to the user's presence, the contact would then
   need to send a subscription request to the user.  (XMPP clients will
   often automatically send the subscription request instead of
   requiring the contact to initiate the subscription request, since it
   is assumed that the desired end state is a mutual subscription.)
   Naturally, when the contact sends a subscription request to the user,
   the subscription states will be different from those shown in the
   foregoing examples (see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>) and the roles will be reversed.

   When the user's server receives a subscription approval, it MUST
   first check if the contact is in the user's roster with
   subscription='none' or subscription='from' and the 'ask' flag set to
   "subscribe" (i.e., a subscription state of "None + Pending Out",
   "None + Pending Out+In", or "From + Pending Out"; see <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>).
   If this check is successful, then the user's server MUST:

   1.  Deliver the inbound subscription approval to all of the user's
       interested resources (this helps to give the user's client(s)
       proper context regarding the subscription approval so that they
       can differentiate between a roster push originated by another of
       the user's resources and a subscription approval received from
       the contact).  This MUST occur before sending the roster push
       described in the next step.

   US: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com'
                 id='h4v1c4kj'
                 to='romeo@example.net'
                 type='subscribed'/&gt;

   2.  Initiate a roster push to all of the user's interested resources,
       containing an updated roster item for the contact with the
       'subscription' attribute set to a value of "to" (if the
       subscription state was "None + Pending Out" or "None + Pending
       Out+In") or "both" (if the subscription state was "From + Pending
       Out").

   US: &lt;iq id='b89c5r7ib576'

   3.  The user's server MUST also deliver the available presence stanza
       received from each of the contact's available resources to each
       of the user's available resources.

   [ ... to resource1 ... ]

   US: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com/balcony'

                 to='romeo@example.net'/&gt;

      Implementation Note: If the user's account has no available
      resources when the inbound subscription approval notification is
      received, the user's server MAY keep a record of the notification
      (ideally the complete presence stanza) and then deliver the
      notification when the account next has an available resource.
      This behavior provides more complete signaling to the user
      regarding the reasons for the roster change that occurred while
      the user was offline.

   Otherwise -- that is, if the user does not exist, if the contact is
   not in the user's roster, or if the contact is in the user's roster
   with a subscription state other than those described in the foregoing
   check -- then the user's server MUST silently ignore the subscription
   approval notification by not delivering it to the user, not modifying
   the user's roster, and not generating a roster push to the user's
   interested resources.

   From the perspective of the user, there now exists a subscription to
   the contact's presence (which is why the 'subscription' attribute is
   set to a value of "to").

   If a contact would like to cancel a subscription that it has
   previously granted to a user, to cancel a subscription pre-approval
   (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>), or to deny a subscription request, it sends a presence
   stanza of type "unsubscribed".

   Upon receiving the outbound subscription cancellation, the contact's
   server MUST proceed as follows.

   1.  If the user's bare JID is not yet in the contact's roster or is
       in the contact's roster with a state of "None", "None + Pending
       Out", or "To", the contact's server SHOULD NOT route or deliver
       the presence stanza of type "unsubscribed" to the user and MUST
       NOT send presence notifications of type "unavailable" to the user
       as described below.

   2.  If the user's bare JID is in the contact's roster with a state of
       "None", "None + Pending Out", or "To" and the 'approved' flag is
       set to "true" (thus signaling a subscription pre-approval as
       described under <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>), the contact's server MUST remove
       the pre-approval and MUST NOT route or deliver the presence
       stanza of type "unsubscribed" to the user.

   3.  Otherwise, as shown in the following examples, the contact's
       server MUST route or deliver both presence notifications of type
       "unavailable" and presence stanzas of type "unsubscribed" to the
       user and MUST send a roster push to the contact.

   While the user is still subscribed to the contact's presence (i.e.,
   before the contact's server routes or delivers the presence stanza of
   type "unsubscribed" to the user), the contact's server MUST send a
   presence stanza of type "unavailable" from all of the contact's
   online resources to the user.

   If a user would like to unsubscribe from a contact's presence, it

   Upon receiving the outbound unsubscribe, the user's server MUST
   proceed as follows.

   1.  If the contact is hosted on the same server as the user, then the
       server MUST adhere to the rules specified under <a href="#section-3.3.3">Section 3.3.3</a>
       when processing the subscription request.

   2.  If the contact is hosted on a remote server, subject to local
       service policies the user's server MUST then route the stanza to
       that remote domain in accordance with core XMPP stanza processing
       rules.  (This can result in returning an appropriate stanza error
       to the user, such as &lt;remote-server-timeout/&gt;.)

   As mentioned, before locally delivering or remotely routing the
   unsubscribe, the user's server MUST stamp the stanza with the bare
   JID &lt;user@domainpart&gt; of the user.

   3.  Generate an outbound presence stanza of type "unavailable" from

      Implementation Note: If the contact's account has no available
      resources when the inbound unsubscribe notification is received,
      the contact's server MAY keep a record of the notification
      (ideally the complete presence stanza) and then deliver the
      notification when the account next has an available resource.
      This behavior provides more complete signaling to the user
      regarding the reasons for the roster change that occurred while
      the user was offline.

   Otherwise -- that is, if the contact does not exist, if the user is
   not in the contact's roster, or if the user's bare JID is in the
   contact's roster with a subscription state other than those described
   in the foregoing check -- then the contact's server MUST silently
   ignore the unsubscribe stanza by not delivering it to the contact,
   not modifying the contact's roster, and not generating a roster push
   to the contact's interested resources.  However, if the contact's
   server is keeping track of an inbound presence subscription request

   from the user to the contact but the user is not yet in the contact's
   roster (functionally equivalent to a subscription state of "None +

   the inbound presence subscription request (it cannot remove the user
   from the contact's roster because the user was never added to the
   contact's roster).

      Implementation Note: The user's client MUST NOT depend on
      receiving the unavailable presence notification from the contact,
      since it MUST consider its presence subscription to the contact,
      and its presence information about the contact, to be null and
      void when it sends the presence stanza of type "unsubscribe" or
      when it receives the roster push triggered by the unsubscribe

   If a user has not received a subscription request from a contact, the
   user can "pre-approve" such a request so that it will be
   automatically approved by the user's server.

   Support for subscription pre-approvals is OPTIONAL on the part of
   clients and servers.  If a server supports subscription pre-
   approvals, then it MUST advertise the following stream feature during
   stream negotiation.

   &lt;sub xmlns='urn:xmpp:features:pre-approval'/&gt;

   The subscription pre-approval stream feature is merely informative
   and therefore is never mandatory-to-negotiate.

   Upon receiving the presence stanza of type "subscribed", the user's
   server MUST proceed as follows if it supports subscription pre-
   approvals.

   1.  If the contact is in the user's roster with a state of "Both",
       "From", or "From + Pending Out", the user's server MUST silently
       ignore the stanza.

   2.  If the contact is in the user's roster with a state of "To +
       Pending In", "None + Pending In", or "None + Pending Out+In", the
       user's server MUST handle the stanza as a normal subscription
       approval (see under <a href="#section-3.1.5">Section 3.1.5</a>) by updating the existing
       roster item to a state of "Both", "From", or "From + Pending Out"
       (respectively), pushing the modified roster item to all of the
       user's interested resources, and routing the presence stanza of
       type "subscribed" to the contact.

   3.  If the contact is in the user's roster with a state of "To",
       "None", or "None + Pending Out", the user's server MUST note the
       subscription pre-approval by setting the 'approved' flag to a
       value of "true", then push the modified roster item to all of the
       user's interested resources.  However, the user's server MUST NOT
       route the presence stanza of type "subscribed" to the contact.

   4.  If the contact is not yet in the user's roster, the user's server
       MUST create a roster item for the contact with a state of "None"
       and set the 'approved' flag to a value of "true", then push the
       roster item to all of the user's interested resources.  However,
       the user's server MUST NOT route the presence stanza of type
       "subscribed" to the contact.

   An example of the roster push follows.

   US: &lt;iq id='h3bs81vs763f'
           to='romeo@example.net/bar'
           type='set'&gt;

                 subscription='none'/&gt;
         &lt;/query&gt;
       &lt;/iq&gt;

   When the 'approved' flag is set to "true", the user's server MUST NOT
   deliver a presence stanza of type "subscribe" from the contact to the
   user, but instead MUST automatically respond to such a stanza on

   behalf of the user by returning a presence stanza of type
   "subscribed" from the bare JID of the user to the bare JID of the
   contact.

      Implementation Note: It is a matter of implementation or local
      service policy whether the server maintains a record of the
      subscription approval after it has received a presence
      subscription request from the contact.  If the server does not
      maintain such a record, upon receiving the subscription request it
      will not include the 'approved' attribute in the roster item for
      the contact (i.e., in subsequent roster pushes and roster
      results).  If the server maintains such a record, it will always
      include the 'approved' attribute (set to "true") in the roster
      item for the contact, until and unless the user sends a presence
      stanza of type "unsubscribed" to the contact (or removes the
      contact from the roster entirely).

      Implementation Note: A client can cancel a pre-approval by sending
      a presence stanza of type "unsubscribed", as described more fully
      under <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>.  In this case, the user's server would send a
      roster push to all of the user's interested resources with the
      'approved' attribute removed.  (Alternatively, the client can
      simply remove the roster item entirely.)

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Presence%20Fundamentals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Presence Fundamentals</span>

   The concept of presence refers to an entity's availability for
   communication over a network.  At the most basic level, presence is a
   boolean "on/off" variable that signals whether an entity is available
   or unavailable for communication (the terms "online" and "offline"
   are also used).  In XMPP, an entity's availability is signaled when
   its client generates a &lt;presence/&gt; stanza with no 'type' attribute,
   and an entity's lack of availability is signaled when its client
   generates a &lt;presence/&gt; stanza whose 'type' attribute has a value of
   "unavailable".

   XMPP presence typically follows a "publish-subscribe" or "observer"
   pattern, wherein an entity sends presence to its server, and its
   server then broadcasts that information to all of the entity's
   contacts who have a subscription to the entity's presence (in the
   terminology of [<a href="#ref-IMP-MODEL">IMP-MODEL</a>], an entity that generates presence is a
   "presentity" and the entities that receive presence are
   "subscribers").  A client generates presence for broadcast to all
   subscribed entities by sending a presence stanza to its server with
   no 'to' address, where the presence stanza has either no 'type'
   attribute or a 'type' attribute whose value is "unavailable".  This

   kind of presence is called "broadcast presence".  (A client can also
   send "directed presence", i.e., a presence stanza with a 'to'
   address; this is less common but is sometimes used to send presence
   to entities that are not subscribed to the user's presence; see
   <a href="#section-4.6">Section 4.6</a>.)

   After a client completes the preconditions specified in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>],
   it can establish a "presence session" at its server by sending
   initial presence (<a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>), where the presence session is
   terminated by sending unavailable presence (<a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>).  For the
   duration of its presence session, a connected resource (in the
   terminology of [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>]) is said to be an "available resource".

   In XMPP, applications that combine messaging and presence
   functionality, the default type of communication for which presence
   signals availability is messaging; however, it is not necessary for
   XMPP applications to combine messaging and presence functionality,
   and they can provide standalone presence features without messaging
   (in addition, XMPP servers do not require information about network
   availability in order to successfully route message and IQ stanzas).

      Informational Note: In the examples that follow, the user is
      &lt;juliet@example.com&gt;, she has two available resources ("balcony"
      and "chamber"), and she has three contacts in her roster with a
      subscription state of "from" or "both": &lt;romeo@example.net&gt;,
      &lt;mercutio@example.com&gt;, and &lt;benvolio@example.net&gt;.

   send the initial presence stanza from the full JID

   user's newly available resource to all of the user's available
   resources, including the resource that generated the presence
   notification in the first place (i.e., an entity is implicitly
   subscribed to its own presence).

   When the contact's client receives presence from the user, the
   following behavior is suggested for interactive clients:

   1.  If the user's bare JID is in the contact's roster, display the
       presence information in an appropriate roster interface.

   2.  If the user is not in the contact's roster but the contact and
       the user are actively exchanging message or IQ stanzas, display
       the presence information in the user interface for that
       communication session (see also <a href="#section-4.6">Section 4.6</a> and <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>).

   3.  Otherwise, ignore the presence information and do not display it
       to the contact.

   A "presence probe" is a request for a contact's current presence
   information, sent on behalf of a user by the user's server;
   syntactically it is a presence stanza whose 'type' attribute has a
   value of "probe".  In the context of presence subscriptions, the
   value of the 'from' address MUST be the bare JID of the subscribed
   user and the value of the 'to' address MUST be the bare JID of the
   contact to which the user is subscribed, since presence subscriptions
   are based on the bare JID.

   US: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com'
                 id='ign291v5'
                 to='romeo@example.net'
                 type='probe'/&gt;

      Interoperability Note: <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a> specified that probes are sent
      from the full JID, not the bare JID (a rule that was changed
      because subscriptions are based on the bare JID).  Some existing
      implementations send from the full JID instead of the bare JID.

   Probes can also be sent by an entity that has received presence
   outside the context of a presence subscription, typically when the
   contact has sent directed presence as described under <a href="#section-4.6">Section 4.6</a>; in
   this case the value of the 'from' or 'to' address can be a full JID
   instead of a bare JID.  See <a href="#section-4.6">Section 4.6</a> for a complete discussion.

   Presence probes SHOULD NOT be sent by a client, because in general a
   client will not need to send them since the task of gathering
   presence from a user's contacts is managed by the user's server.
   However, if a user's client generates an outbound presence probe then
   the user's server SHOULD route the probe (if the contact is at
   another server) or process the probe (if the contact is at the same
   server) and MUST NOT use its receipt of the presence probe from a
   connected client as the sole cause for returning a stanza or stream
   error to the client.

   When a server needs to discover the availability of a user's contact,
   it sends a presence probe from the bare JID &lt;user@domainpart&gt; of the
   user to the bare JID &lt;contact@domainpart&gt; of the contact.

      Implementation Note: Although presence probes are intended for
      sending to contacts (i.e., entities to which a user is
      subscribed), a server MAY send a presence probe to the full JID of
      an entity from which the user has received presence information
      during the current session.

   The user's server SHOULD send a presence probe whenever the user
   starts a new presence session by sending initial presence; however,
   the server MAY choose not to send the probe at that point if it has
   what it deems to be reliable and up-to-date presence information
   about the user's contacts (e.g., because the user has another
   available resource or because the user briefly logged off and on
   before the new presence session began).  In addition, a server MAY
   periodically send a presence probe to a contact if it has not
   received presence information or other traffic from the contact in
   some configurable amount of time; this can help to prevent "ghost"
   contacts who appear to be online but in fact are not.

   US: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com'
                 id='ign291v5'
                 to='romeo@example.net'
                 type='probe'/&gt;

   US: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com'

                 to='mercutio@example.com'
                 type='probe'/&gt;

   Naturally, the user's server does not need to send a presence probe
   to a contact if the contact's account resides on the same server as
   the user, since the server possesses the contact's information
   locally.

   Upon receiving a presence probe to the contact's bare JID from the
   user's server on behalf of the user, the contact's server MUST reply
   as follows:

   1.  If the contact account does not exist or the user's bare JID is
       in the contact's roster with a subscription state other than
       "From", "From + Pending Out", or "Both" (as explained under
       <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>), then the contact's server SHOULD return a presence
       stanza of type "unsubscribed" in response to the presence probe
       (this will trigger a protocol flow for canceling the user's
       subscription to the contact as described under <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>;
       however, this MUST NOT result in cancellation of a subscription
       pre-approval as described under <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>).  Here the 'from'
       address MUST be the bare JID of the contact, since specifying a
       full JID would constitute a presence leak as described in
       [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>].

                 type='unsubscribed'/&gt;

   However, if a server receives a presence probe from a configured
   domain of the server itself or another such trusted service, it MAY
   provide presence information about the user to that entity.

   2.  Else, if the contact has moved temporarily or permanently to
       another address, then the server SHOULD return a presence stanza
       of type "error" with a stanza error condition of &lt;redirect/&gt;
       (temporary) or &lt;gone/&gt; (permanent) that includes the new address
       of the contact.

       SHOULD reply to the presence probe by sending to the user a
       presence stanza of type "unavailable" (although sending

       unavailable presence here is preferable because it results in a
       deterministic answer to the probe, it is not mandatory because it
       can greatly increase the number of presence notifications
       generated by the contact's server).  Here the 'from' address is
       the bare JID because there is no available resource associated
       with the contact.  If appropriate in accordance with local
       security policies this presence notification MAY include the full
       XML of the last unavailable presence stanza that the server
       received from the contact (including the 'id' of the original
       stanza), but if not then the presence notification SHOULD simply
       indicate that the contact is unavailable without any of the
       details originally provided.  In any case, the presence
       notification returned to the probing entity SHOULD include
       information about the time when the last unavailable presence
       stanza was generated (formatted using the XMPP delayed delivery

       &lt;/presence&gt;

   4.  Else, if the contact has at least one available resource, then
       the server MUST reply to the presence probe by sending to the
       user the full XML of the last presence stanza with no 'to'
       attribute received by the server from each of the contact's
       available resources.  Here the 'from' addresses are the full JIDs
       of each available resource.

      with [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>], the contact's server will need to transform the
      content namespace from 'jabber:client' to 'jabber:server' if it
      sends the complete stanza over a server-to-server stream.

   If the contact's server receives a presence probe addressed to a full
   JID of the contact, the server MUST NOT return presence information
   about any resource except the resource specified by the 'to' address
   of the probe.  Rules #1 and #2 for a bare JID probe apply equally to
   the case of a full JID probe.  If there is a resource matching the
   full JID and the probing entity has authorization via a presence
   subscription to see the contact's presence, then the server MUST
   return an available presence notification, which SHOULD communicate
   only the fact that the resource is available (not detailed
   information such as the &lt;show/&gt;, &lt;status/&gt;, &lt;priority/&gt;, or presence
   extensions).


   CS: &lt;presence from='romeo@example.net/bar'
                 to='lobby@chat.example.com'/&gt;

      supplement the foregoing for handling of directed presence.

   The handling of the 'id' attribute in relation to presence probes was
   unspecified in <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a>.  Although the pattern of "send a probe and
   receive a reply" might seem like a request-response protocol similar
   to the XMPP &lt;iq/&gt; stanza, in fact it is not because the response to a
   probe might consist of multiple presence stanzas (one for each
   available resource currently active for the contact).  For this
   reason, if the contact currently has available resources then the
   contact's server SHOULD preserve the 'id' attribute of the contact's
   original presence stanza (if any) when sending those presence
   notifications to the probing entity.  By contrast, if the contact
   currently has no available resources, the probing entity is not
   authorized (via presence subscription) to see the contact's presence,
   or an error occurs in relation to the probe, then the contact's
   server SHOULD mirror the 'id' of the user's presence probe when
   replying to the probing entity.

   The following examples illustrate the difference.

   In the first scenario, Juliet sends presence from her "chamber"
   resource.






<span class="grey">Saint-Andre                  Standards Track                   [Page 55]</span></pre>

   CC: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com/chamber' id='pres1'&gt;
         &lt;show&gt;dnd&lt;/show&gt;
         &lt;status&gt;busy!&lt;/status&gt;
       &lt;/presence&gt;

   She also sends presence from her "balcony" resource.

   CC: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com/balcony' id='pres2'&gt;
         &lt;show&gt;away&lt;/show&gt;
         &lt;status&gt;stepped away&lt;/status&gt;
       &lt;/presence&gt;

   Romeo's server then sends a probe to Juliet.

   US: &lt;presence from='romeo@example.net' id='probe1' type='probe'/&gt;

   Juliet's server then sends both of her presence notifications to
   Romeo, preserving the 'id' attributes included in the stanzas that
   her client has sent.

   CS: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com/chamber' id='pres1'&gt;
         &lt;show&gt;dnd&lt;/show&gt;
         &lt;status&gt;busy!&lt;/status&gt;
       &lt;/presence&gt;

   CS: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com/balcony' id='pres2'&gt;

         &lt;status&gt;stepped away&lt;/status&gt;
       &lt;/presence&gt;

   In the second scenario, Juliet is offline when Romeo's server sends a
   probe.

   US: &lt;presence from='romeo@example.net'
                 id='probe2'
                 type='probe'/&gt;

   Juliet's server replies with an unavailable notification, mirroring
   the 'id' of Rome's presence probe because there is no 'id' to
   preserve from an available notification that her client has sent.

   CS: &lt;presence from='juliet@example.com'

   After sending initial presence, at any time during its session the
   user's client can update its availability for broadcast by sending a
   presence stanza with no 'to' address and no 'type' attribute.

   UC: &lt;presence&gt;
         &lt;show&gt;away&lt;/show&gt;
       &lt;/presence&gt;

   The presence broadcast MAY contain the &lt;priority/&gt; element, the
   &lt;show/&gt; element, and one or more instances of the &lt;status/&gt; element,
   as well as extended content; details are provided under <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>.

   However, a user SHOULD send a presence update only to broadcast
   information that is relevant to the user's availability for
   communication or the communication capabilities of the resource.
   Information that is not relevant in this way might be of interest to
   the user's contacts but SHOULD be sent via other means, such as the
   "publish-subscribe" method described in [<a href="#ref-XEP-0163">XEP-0163</a>].

   Upon receiving a presence stanza expressing updated availability, the
   user's server MUST broadcast the full XML of that presence stanza to
   the contacts who are in the user's roster with a subscription type of
   "from" or "both".

      Interoperability Note: <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a> specified that the user's server
      would check to make sure that it had not received a presence error
      from the contact before sending subsequent presence notifications.
      That rule has been removed because this specification uses
      presence stanzas of type "unsubscribe" (not "error") to solve
      subscription synchronization problems, in part because such
      stanzas change the contact's subscription state in the user's
      roster to either "none" or "to" (see <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> and <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>),
      thus obviating the need for the error check.

      Interoperability Note: If the subscription type is "both", some
      existing server implementations send subsequent presence
      notifications to a contact only if the contact is online according
      to the user's server (that is, if the user's server never received
      a positive indication that the contact is online in response to
      the presence probe it sent to the contact, the user's server does
      not send subsequent presence notifications from the user to the

   From the perspective of the contact's client, there is no significant
   difference between initial presence broadcast and subsequent
   presence, so the contact's client follows the rules for processing of
   inbound presence defined under <a href="#section-4.4.3">Section 4.4.3</a>.

   Before ending its presence session with a server, the user's client
   SHOULD gracefully become unavailable by sending "unavailable
   presence", i.e., a presence stanza that possesses no 'to' attribute
   and that possesses a 'type' attribute whose value is "unavailable".

   UC: &lt;presence type='unavailable'/&gt;

   Optionally, the unavailable presence stanza MAY contain one or more
   &lt;status/&gt; elements specifying the reason why the user is no longer
   available.

   UC: &lt;presence type='unavailable'&gt;
         &lt;status&gt;going on vacation&lt;/status&gt;
       &lt;/presence&gt;

   However, the unavailable presence stanza MUST NOT contain the
   &lt;priority/&gt; element or the &lt;show/&gt; element, since these elements
   apply only to available resources.

   The user's server MUST NOT depend on receiving unavailable presence
   from an available resource, since the resource might become
   unavailable ungracefully (e.g., the resource's XML stream might be

   If an available resource becomes unavailable for any reason (either
   gracefully or ungracefully), the user's server MUST broadcast
   unavailable presence to all contacts that are in the user's roster
   with a subscription type of "from" or "both".

      Interoperability Note: <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a> specified that the user's server
      would check to make sure that it had not received a presence error
      from the contact before sending unavailable presence
      notifications.  That rule has been removed because this
      specification uses presence stanzas of type "unsubscribe" (not
      "error") to solve subscription synchronization problems, in part
      because such stanzas change the contact's subscription state in
      the user's roster to either "none" or "to" (see <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> and
      <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>), thus obviating the need for the error check.

      Implementation Note: Even if the user's server does not broadcast
      the user's subsequent presence notifications to contacts who are
      offline (as described under <a href="#section-4.4.2">Section 4.4.2</a>), it MUST broadcast the
      user's unavailable presence notification; if it did not do so, the
      last presence received by the contact's server would be the user's
      initial presence for the presence session, with the result that
      the contact would consider the user to be online.

      Implementation Note: See <a href="#section-4.6">Section 4.6</a> regarding rules that
      supplement the foregoing for handling of directed presence.

   If the unavailable notification was gracefully received from the
   client, then the server MUST broadcast the full XML of the presence
   stanza.

   The user's server MUST also send the unavailable notification to all
   of the user's available resources (as well as to the resource that
   generated the unavailable presence in the first place).

       &lt;/presence&gt;

   If the server detects that the user has gone offline ungracefully,
   then the server MUST generate the unavailable presence broadcast on
   the user's behalf.

      Implementation Note: Any presence stanza with no 'type' attribute
      and no 'to' attribute that the client sends after the server
      broadcasts or generates an unavailable presence notification MUST
      be routed or delivered by the user's server to all subscribers
      (i.e., MUST be treated as equivalent to initial presence for a new
      presence session).

   the contact's available resources.

   From the perspective of the contact's client, there is no significant
   difference between available presence broadcast and unavailable
   presence broadcast, so in general the contact's client follows the
   rules for processing of inbound presence defined under <a href="#section-4.4.3">Section 4.4.3</a>.

   However, if the contact receives an unavailable notification from the
   bare JID of the user (rather than the full JID of a particular
   available resource), the contact's client SHOULD treat the
   unavailable notification as applying to all resources.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.6.%20%20Directed%20Presence"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.6" name="section-4.6">4.6</a>.  Directed Presence</span>

   This section supplements the rules for client and server processing
   of presence notifications and presence probes, but only for the
   special case of directed presence.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.6.1.%20%20General%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.6.1" name="section-4.6.1">4.6.1</a>.  General Considerations</span>

   In general, a client sends directed presence when it wishes to share
   availability information with an entity that is not subscribed to its
   presence, typically on a temporary basis.  Common uses of directed
   presence include casual one-to-one chat sessions as described under
   <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a> and multi-user chat rooms as described in [<a href="#ref-XEP-0045">XEP-0045</a>].

   The temporary relationship established by sharing directed presence
   with another entity is secondary to the permanent relationship
   established through a presence subscription.  Therefore, the acts of
   creating, modifying, or canceling a presence subscription MUST take
   precedence over the rules specified in the following subsections.
   For example, if a user shares directed presence with a contact but
   then adds the contact to the user's roster by completing the presence
   subscription "handshake", the user's server MUST treat the contact
   just as it would any normal subscriber as described under <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>,
   for example, by sending subsequent presence broadcasts to the
   contact.  As another example, if the user then cancels the contact's
   subscription to the user's presence, the user's server MUST handle
   the cancellation just as it normally would as described under
   <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>, which includes sending unavailable presence to the
   contact even if the user has sent directed presence to the contact.

   XMPP servers typically implement directed presence by keeping a list
   of the entities (bare JIDs or full JIDs) to which a user has sent
   directed presence during the user's current session for a given
   resource (full JID), then clearing the list when the user goes
   offline (e.g., by sending a broadcast presence stanza of type
   "unavailable").  The server MUST remove from the directed presence



<span class="grey">Saint-Andre                  Standards Track                   [Page 62]</span></pre>

   list (or its functional equivalent) any entity to which the user
   sends directed unavailable presence and SHOULD remove any entity that
   sends unavailable presence to the user.

   As noted, directed presence is a client-generated presence stanza
   with a 'to' attribute whose value is the bare JID or full JID of the
   other entity and with either no 'type' attribute (indicating
   availability) or a 'type' attribute whose value is "unavailable".

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.6.3.%20%20Server%20Processing%20of%20Outbound%20Directed%20Presence"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.6.3" name="section-4.6.3">4.6.3</a>.  Server Processing of Outbound Directed Presence</span>

   When the user's server receives a directed presence stanza, it SHOULD
   process it according to the following rules.

   1.  If the user sends directed available or unavailable presence to a
       contact that is in the user's roster with a subscription type of
       "from" or "both" after having sent initial presence and before
       sending unavailable presence broadcast (i.e., during the user's
       presence session), the user's server MUST locally deliver or
       remotely route the full XML of that presence stanza but SHOULD
       NOT otherwise modify the contact's status regarding presence
       broadcast (i.e., it SHOULD include the contact's JID in any
       subsequent presence broadcasts initiated by the user).

   2.  If the user sends directed presence to an entity that is not in
       the user's roster with a subscription type of "from" or "both"
       after having sent initial presence and before sending unavailable
       presence broadcast (i.e., during the user's presence session),
       the user's server MUST locally deliver or remotely route the full
       XML of that presence stanza to the entity but MUST NOT modify the
       contact's status regarding available presence broadcast (i.e., it
       MUST NOT include the entity's JID in any subsequent broadcasts of
       available presence initiated by the user); however, if the
       available resource from which the user sent the directed presence
       becomes unavailable, the user's server MUST route that
       unavailable presence to the entity (if the user has not yet sent
       directed unavailable presence to that entity).

   3.  If the user sends directed presence without first sending initial
       presence or after having sent unavailable presence broadcast
       (i.e., the resource is connected but not available), the user's
       server MUST treat the entity to which the user sends directed
       presence as in case #2 above.

   From the perspective of the contact's server, there is no significant
   difference between presence broadcast and directed presence, so the
   contact's server follows the rules for processing of inbound presence
   defined under Sections <a href="#section-4.3.2">4.3.2</a>, <a href="#section-4.4.3">4.4.3</a>, and <a href="#section-4.5.3">4.5.3</a>.

   If a user's client has sent directed presence to another entity
   (e.g., a one-to-one chat partner or a multi-user chat room), after
   some time the entity or its server might want to know if the client
   is still online.  This scenario is especially common in the case of
   multi-user chat rooms, in which the user might be a participant for a
   long period of time.  If the user's client goes offline without the
   chat room being informed (either by the client or the client's
   server), the user's representation in the room might become a "ghost"
   that appears to be participating but that in fact is no longer
   present in the room.  To detect such "ghosts", some multi-user chat
   room implementations send presence probes to users that have joined
   the room.

   In the case of directed presence, the probing entity SHOULD send the
   probe from the JID that received directed presence (whether a full
   JID or a bare JID).  The probe SHOULD be sent to the user's full JID,
   not the user's bare JID without a resourcepart, because the temporary
   "authorization" involved with directed presence is based on the full
   JID from which the user sent directed presence to the probing entity.
   When the user's server receives a probe, it MUST first apply any
   logic associated with presence subscriptions as described under
   <a href="#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</a>.  If the probing entity does not have a subscription to
   the user's presence, then the server MUST check if the user has sent
   directed presence to the entity during its current session; if so,
   the server SHOULD answer the probe with only mere presence of type
   "available" or "unavailable" (i.e., not including child elements) and
   only for that full JID (i.e., not for any other resources that might
   be currently associated with the user's bare JID).

   The absence of a 'type' attribute signals that the relevant entity is
   available for communication (see <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> and <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>).

   A 'type' attribute with a value of "unavailable" signals that the
   relevant entity is not available for communication (see <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>).

   The XMPP presence stanza is also used to negotiate and manage
   subscriptions to the presence of other entities.  These tasks are
   completed via presence stanzas of type "subscribe", "unsubscribe",
   "subscribed", and "unsubscribed" as described under <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   If a user and contact are associated with different XMPP servers,
   those servers also use a special presence stanza of type "probe" in
   order to determine the availability of the entity on the peer server;
   details are provided under <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>.  Clients SHOULD NOT send
   presence stanzas of type "probe".

   The values of the 'type' attribute can be summarized as follows:

   o  error -- An error has occurred regarding processing of a
      previously sent presence stanza; if the presence stanza is of type
      "error", it MUST include an &lt;error/&gt; child element (refer to
      [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>]).

   o  probe -- A request for an entity's current presence; SHOULD be
      generated only by a server on behalf of a user.

   o  subscribe -- The sender wishes to subscribe to the recipient's
      presence.

   o  subscribed -- The sender has allowed the recipient to receive
      their presence.

   o  unavailable -- The sender is no longer available for
      communication.

   o  unsubscribe -- The sender is unsubscribing from the receiver's
      presence.

   o  unsubscribed -- The subscription request has been denied or a
      previously granted subscription has been canceled.

   If the value of the 'type' attribute is not one of the foregoing
   values, the recipient or an intermediate router SHOULD return a
   stanza error of &lt;bad-request/&gt;.

      Implementation Note: There is no default value for the 'type'

      Implementation Note: There is no value of "available" for the

   In accordance with the default namespace declaration, a presence
   stanza is qualified by the 'jabber:client' or 'jabber:server'
   namespace, which defines certain child elements of presence stanzas,
   in particular the &lt;show/&gt;, &lt;status/&gt;, and &lt;priority/&gt; elements.
   These child elements are used to provide more detailed information
   about an entity's availability.  Typically these child elements are
   included only if the presence stanza possesses no 'type' attribute,
   although exceptions are noted in the text that follows.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.7.2.1.%20%20Show%20Element"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.7.2.1" name="section-4.7.2.1">4.7.2.1</a>.  Show Element</span>

   The OPTIONAL &lt;show/&gt; element specifies the particular availability
   sub-state of an entity or a specific resource thereof.  A presence
   stanza MUST NOT contain more than one &lt;show/&gt; element.  There are no
   attributes defined for the &lt;show/&gt; element.  The &lt;show/&gt; element MUST
   NOT contain mixed content (as defined in Section 3.2.2 of [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)"'>XML</a>]).
   The XML character data of the &lt;show/&gt; element is not meant for
   presentation to a human user.  The XML character data MUST be one of
   the following (additional availability states could be defined
   through extended content elements):

   o  away -- The entity or resource is temporarily away.

   o  chat -- The entity or resource is actively interested in chatting.

   o  dnd -- The entity or resource is busy (dnd = "Do Not Disturb").

   o  xa -- The entity or resource is away for an extended period (xa =
      "eXtended Away").

   If no &lt;show/&gt; element is provided, the entity is assumed to be online
   and available.

   Any specialized processing of availability states by recipients and
   intermediate routers is up to the implementation (e.g., incorporation
   of availability states into stanza routing and delivery logic).

   The OPTIONAL &lt;status/&gt; element contains human-readable XML character
   data specifying a natural-language description of an entity's

   The OPTIONAL &lt;priority/&gt; element contains non-human-readable XML
   character data that specifies the priority level of the resource.
   The value MUST be an integer between -128 and +127.  A presence
   stanza MUST NOT contain more than one &lt;priority/&gt; element.  There are
   no attributes defined for the &lt;priority/&gt; element.  The &lt;priority/&gt;
   element MUST NOT contain mixed content (as defined in Section 3.2.2
   of [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)"'>XML</a>]).

     &lt;priority&gt;1&lt;/priority&gt;
   &lt;/presence&gt;

   If no priority is provided, the processing server or client MUST
   consider the priority to be zero ("0").

   The client's server MAY override the priority value provided by the
   client (e.g., in order to impose a message handling rule of
   delivering a message intended for the account's bare JID to all of
   the account's available resources).  If the server does so, it MUST
   communicate the modified priority value when it echoes the client's
   presence back to itself and sends the presence notification to the
   user's contacts (because this modified priority value is typically
   the default value of zero, communicating the modified priority value
   can be done by not including the &lt;priority/&gt; child element).

   For information regarding the semantics of priority values in stanza
   processing within instant messaging and presence applications, refer
   to <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.

   As described in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>], an XML stanza MAY contain any child
   element that is qualified by a namespace other than the default
   namespace; this applies to the presence stanza as well.

   (In the following example, the presence stanza includes entity
   capabilities information as defined in [<a href="#ref-XEP-0115">XEP-0115</a>].)

   &lt;presence from='romeo@example.net'&gt;
     &lt;c xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/caps'

        ver='q07IKJEyjvHSyhy//CH0CxmKi8w='/&gt;
   &lt;/presence&gt;

   Any extended content included in a presence stanza SHOULD represent
   aspects of an entity's availability for communication or provide
   information about communication-related capabilities.

   Once a client has authenticated with a server and bound a resource to
   an XML stream as described in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>], an XMPP server will route
   XML stanzas to and from that client.  One kind of stanza that can be
   exchanged is &lt;message/&gt; (if, that is, messaging functionality is
   enabled on the server).  Exchanging messages is a basic use of XMPP
   and occurs when a user generates a message stanza that is addressed
   to another entity.  As defined under <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>, the sender's server
   is responsible for delivering the message to the intended recipient
   (if the recipient is on the same local server) or for routing the
   message to the recipient's server (if the recipient is on a remote
   server).  Thus a message stanza is used to "push" information to
   another entity.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20One-to-One%20Chat%20Sessions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  One-to-One Chat Sessions</span>

   In practice, instant messaging activity between human users tends to
   occur in the form of a conversational burst that we call a "chat
   session": the exchange of multiple messages between two parties in
   relatively rapid succession within a relatively brief period of time.

   When a human user intends to engage in such a chat session with a
   contact (rather than sending a single message to which no reply is
   expected), the message type generated by the user's client SHOULD be
   "chat" and the contact's client SHOULD preserve that message type in
   subsequent replies.  The user's client also SHOULD include a

   &lt;thread/&gt; element with its initial message, which the contact's
   client SHOULD also preserve during the life of the chat session (see
   <a href="#section-5.2.5">Section 5.2.5</a>).

   The user's client SHOULD address the initial message in a chat
   session to the bare JID &lt;contact@domainpart&gt; of the contact (rather
   than attempting to guess an appropriate full JID
   &lt;contact@domainpart/resourcepart&gt; based on the &lt;show/&gt;, &lt;status/&gt;, or
   &lt;priority/&gt; value of any presence notifications it might have
   received from the contact).  Until and unless the user's client
   receives a reply from the contact, it SHOULD send any further
   messages to the contact's bare JID.  The contact's client SHOULD
   address its replies to the user's full JID
   &lt;user@domainpart/resourcepart&gt; as provided in the 'from' address of
   the initial message.  Once the user's client receives a reply from
   the contact's full JID, it SHOULD address its subsequent messages to
   the contact's full JID as provided in the 'from' address of the
   contact's replies, thus "locking in" on that full JID.  A client
   SHOULD "unlock" after having received a &lt;message/&gt; or &lt;presence/&gt;
   stanza from any other resource controlled by the peer (or a presence
   stanza from the locked resource); as a result, it SHOULD address its
   next message(s) in the chat session to the bare JID of the peer (thus
   "unlocking" the previous "lock") until it receives a message from one
   of the peer's full JIDs.

   When two parties engage in a chat session but do not share presence
   with each other based on a presence subscription, they SHOULD send
   directed presence to each other so that either party can easily
   discover if the peer goes offline during the course of the chat
   session.  However, a client MUST provide a way for a user to disable
   such presence sharing globally or to enable it only with particular
   entities.  Furthermore, a party SHOULD send directed unavailable
   presence to the peer when it has reason to believe that the chat
   session is over (e.g., if, after some reasonable amount of time, no
   subsequent messages have been exchanged between the parties).

   An example of a chat session is provided under <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Message%20Syntax"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Message Syntax</span>

   An instant messaging client specifies an intended recipient for a
   message by providing the JID of the intended recipient in the 'to'
   attribute of the &lt;message/&gt; stanza.

   If the message is being sent outside the context of any existing chat
   session or received message, the value of the 'to' address SHOULD be
   of the form &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt; rather than of the form
   &lt;localpart@domainpart/resourcepart&gt; (see <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>).

   &lt;localpart@domainpart/resourcepart&gt; rather than of the form

   available.

   one chat session; messages sent in the context of a multi-user chat
   room; alerts, notifications, or other information to which no reply
   is expected; and errors.  These uses are differentiated via the
   'type' attribute.  Inclusion of the 'type' attribute is RECOMMENDED.
   If included, the 'type' attribute MUST have one of the following
   values:

   o  chat -- The message is sent in the context of a one-to-one chat
      session.  Typically an interactive client will present a message
      of type "chat" in an interface that enables one-to-one chat
      between the two parties, including an appropriate conversation
      history.  Detailed recommendations regarding one-to-one chat
      sessions are provided under <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>.

   o  error -- The message is generated by an entity that experiences an
      error when processing a message received from another entity (for
      details regarding stanza error syntax, refer to [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>]).  A
      client that receives a message of type "error" SHOULD present an
      appropriate interface informing the original sender regarding the
      nature of the error.

   o  groupchat -- The message is sent in the context of a multi-user
      chat environment (similar to that of [<a href="#ref-IRC" title='"Internet Relay Chat: Architecture"'>IRC</a>]).  Typically a
      receiving client will present a message of type "groupchat" in an
      interface that enables many-to-many chat between the parties,
      including a roster of parties in the chatroom and an appropriate
      conversation history.  For detailed information about XMPP-based
      groupchat, refer to [<a href="#ref-XEP-0045">XEP-0045</a>].

   o  headline -- The message provides an alert, a notification, or
      other transient information to which no reply is expected (e.g.,
      news headlines, sports updates, near-real-time market data, or
      syndicated content).  Because no reply to the message is expected,
      typically a receiving client will present a message of type
      "headline" in an interface that appropriately differentiates the
      message from standalone messages, chat messages, and groupchat
      messages (e.g., by not providing the recipient with the ability to
      reply).  If the 'to' address is the bare JID, the receiving server
      SHOULD deliver the message to all of the recipient's available
      resources with non-negative presence priority and MUST deliver the
      message to at least one of those resources; if the 'to' address is
      a full JID and there is a matching resource, the server MUST
      deliver the message to that resource; otherwise the server MUST
      either silently ignore the message or return an error (see
      <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>).

   o  normal -- The message is a standalone message that is sent outside
      the context of a one-to-one conversation or groupchat, and to
      which it is expected that the recipient will reply.  Typically a
      receiving client will present a message of type "normal" in an
      interface that enables the recipient to reply, but without a
      conversation history.  The default value of the 'type' attribute
      is "normal".

   An IM application SHOULD support all of the foregoing message types.
   If an application receives a message with no 'type' attribute or the
   application does not understand the value of the 'type' attribute
   provided, it MUST consider the message to be of type "normal" (i.e.,
   "normal" is the default).

   Guidelines for server handling of different message types is provided
   under <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.

   Although the 'type' attribute is OPTIONAL, it is considered polite to
   mirror the type in any replies to a message; furthermore, some
   specialized applications (e.g., a multi-user chat service) MAY at
   their discretion enforce the use of a particular message type (e.g.,
   type='groupchat').

   value (either explicitly or by inheritance from the 'xml:lang' value

   The &lt;subject/&gt; element MUST NOT contain mixed content (as defined in
   Section 3.2.2 of [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)"'>XML</a>]).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.5.%20%20Thread%20Element"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.5" name="section-5.2.5">5.2.5</a>.  Thread Element</span>

   The primary use of the XMPP &lt;thread/&gt; element is to uniquely identify
   a conversation thread or "chat session" between two entities
   instantiated by &lt;message/&gt; stanzas of type 'chat'.  However, the XMPP
   &lt;thread/&gt; element MAY also be used to uniquely identify an analogous
   thread between two entities instantiated by &lt;message/&gt; stanzas of
   type 'headline' or 'normal', or among multiple entities in the
   context of a multi-user chat room instantiated by &lt;message/&gt; stanzas
   of type 'groupchat'.  It MAY also be used for &lt;message/&gt; stanzas not
   related to a human conversation, such as a game session or an
   interaction between plugins.  The &lt;thread/&gt; element is not used to
   identify individual messages, only conversations or messaging
   sessions.

   The inclusion of the &lt;thread/&gt; element is OPTIONAL.  Because the
   &lt;thread/&gt; element identifies the particular conversation thread to
   which a message belongs, a message stanza MUST NOT contain more than
   one &lt;thread/&gt; element.

   The &lt;thread/&gt; element MAY possess a 'parent' attribute that
   identifies another thread of which the current thread is an offshoot
   or child.  The 'parent' attribute MUST conform to the syntax of the
   &lt;thread/&gt; element itself and its value MUST be different from the XML
   character data of the &lt;thread/&gt; element on which the 'parent'
   attribute is included.

      Implementation Note: The ability to specify both a parent thread
      and a child thread introduces the possibility of conflicts between
      thread identifiers for overlapping threads.  For example, one
      &lt;thread/&gt; element might contain XML character data of "foo" and a
      'parent' attribute whose value is "bar", a second &lt;thread/&gt;
      element might contain XML character data of "bar" and a 'parent'
      attribute whose value is "baz", and a third &lt;thread/&gt; element
      might contain XML character data of "baz" and a 'parent' attribute
      whose value is once again "foo".  It is up to the implementation
      how it will treat conflicts between such overlapping thread
      identifiers (e.g., whether it will "chain together" thread
      identifiers by showing "foo" as both a parent and grandchild of
      "baz" in a multi-level user interface, or whether it will show
      only one level of dependency at a time).

   The value of the &lt;thread/&gt; element is not human-readable and MUST be
   treated as opaque by entities; no semantic meaning can be derived
   from it, and only exact comparisons can be made against it.  The
   value of the &lt;thread/&gt; element MUST uniquely identify the
   conversation thread either between the conversation partners or more
   generally (one way to ensure uniqueness is by generating a
   universally unique identifier (UUID) as described in [<a href="#ref-UUID" title='"A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace"'>UUID</a>]).

      Security Warning: An application that generates a ThreadID MUST
      ensure that it does not reveal identifying information about the
      entity (e.g., the MAC address of the device on which the XMPP
      application is running).

   The &lt;thread/&gt; element MUST NOT contain mixed content (as defined in
   Section 3.2.2 of [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)"'>XML</a>]).

   As described in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>], an XML stanza MAY contain any child
   element that is qualified by a namespace other than the default
   namespace; this applies to the message stanza as well.  Guidelines
   for handling extended content on the part of both routing servers and
   end recipients are provided in Section 8.4 of [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>].

   (In the following example, the message stanza includes an XHTML-
   formatted version of the message as defined in [<a href="#ref-XEP-0071">XEP-0071</a>]).)

   As described in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>], IQ stanzas provide a structured request-
   response mechanism.  The basic semantics of that mechanism (e.g.,
   that the 'id' attribute is mandatory) are defined in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>],
   whereas the specific semantics needed to complete particular use
   cases are defined in all instances by the extended namespace that
   qualifies the direct child element of an IQ stanza of type "get" or
   "set".  The 'jabber:client' and 'jabber:server' namespaces do not
   define any children of IQ stanzas other than the &lt;error/&gt; element
   common to all stanza types.  This document defines one such extended
   namespace, for Managing the Roster (<a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>).  However, an IQ
   stanza MAY contain structured information qualified by any extended
   namespace.

   The examples in this section illustrate a possible instant messaging
   and presence session.  The user is &lt;romeo@example.net&gt;, he has an
   available resource whose resourcepart is "orchard", and he has the
   following individuals in his roster:

   o  &lt;juliet@example.com&gt; (subscription="both" and she has two
      available resources, "chamber" and "balcony")

   o  &lt;benvolio@example.net&gt; (subscription="to")

   o  &lt;mercutio@example.org&gt; (subscription="from")

   First, the user completes the preconditions (stream establishment,
   TLS and SASL negotiation, and resource binding) described in
   [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>]; those protocol flows are not reproduced here.

   Next, the user requests his roster.

   Example 1: User requests current roster from server

   UC: &lt;iq from='romeo@example.net/orchard'
           id='hf61v3n7'
           type='get'&gt;
         &lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'/&gt;
       &lt;/iq&gt;

   Example 2: User receives roster from server

   US: &lt;iq id='hf61v3n7'
           to='romeo@example.net/orchard'
           type='result'&gt;
         &lt;query xmlns='jabber:iq:roster'&gt;
           &lt;item jid='juliet@example.com'
                 name='Juliet'
                 subscription='both'&gt;
             &lt;group&gt;Friends&lt;/group&gt;
           &lt;/item&gt;
           &lt;item jid='benvolio@example.org'
                 name='Benvolio'
                 subscription='to'/&gt;
           &lt;item jid='mercutio@example.org'
                 name='Mercutio'
                 subscription='from'/&gt;
         &lt;/query&gt;
       &lt;/iq&gt;

   Now the user begins a presence session.

   Example 3: User sends initial presence

   UC: &lt;presence/&gt;

   Example 4: User's server sends presence probes to contacts with
   subscription="to" and subscription="both" on behalf of the user

           to='benvolio@example.org'
           type='probe'/&gt;

   Example 5: User's server sends initial presence to contacts with
   subscription="from" and subscription="both" on behalf of the user's
   available resource, as well as to user

   US: &lt;presence

   roster

   UC: &lt;presence

         &lt;priority&gt;0&lt;/priority&gt;
       &lt;/presence&gt;

   Now the user engages in a chat session with one of his contacts.

   The user can also send subsequent presence broadcast.

   Example 10: User sends updated available presence for broadcast

   Basic server rules for processing XML stanzas are defined in
   [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>], and the reader is referred to that specification for
   underlying rules and security implications.  This section defines
   supplementary rules for XMPP instant messaging and presence servers.

   Some delivery rules defined in this section specify the use of
   "offline storage", i.e., the server's act of storing a message stanza
   on behalf of the user and then delivering it when the user next
   becomes available.  For recommendations regarding offline message
   storage, refer to [<a href="#ref-XEP-0160">XEP-0160</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1.%20%20General%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" name="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  General Considerations</span>

   [<a id="ref-XMPP-CORE" name="ref-XMPP-CORE">XMPP-CORE</a>] discusses general considerations for stanza delivery, in
   particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of
   service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory
   harvesting attacks and presence leaks.  However, the concept of a
   directory harvesting attack does not apply if a contact is known to
   and trusted by a user (because the contact is in the user's roster as
   described under <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>).  Similarly, the concept of a presence
   leak does not apply if a contact is authorized to know a user's
   presence (by means of a presence subscription as described under
   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>) or if the user has voluntarily sent presence to an entity
   (by means of directed presence as described under <a href="#section-4.6">Section 4.6</a>).
   Therefore, in cases where the following sections guard against
   directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks by providing an
   alternative of (a) silently ignoring a stanza or (b) returning an
   error, a server SHOULD return an error if the originating entity is
   in the user's roster (when the error would reveal whether the user's
   account exists) or is authorized to receive presence from the user or
   has received directed presence from the user (when the error would
   reveal the presence of a user's resource).

      Security Warning: All of the stanza processing rules described
      below are defined with the understanding that they will be applied
      subject to enforcement of relevant privacy and security policies,
      such as those deployed by means of [<a href="#ref-XEP-0016">XEP-0016</a>] or [<a href="#ref-XEP-0191">XEP-0191</a>].  The
      conformance language (MUST, SHOULD, etc.) in the following
      sections is not meant to override any such local service policies.

   If the stanza possesses no 'to' attribute, the rules defined in
   [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>] apply.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.3.%20%20Remote%20Domain"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.3" name="section-8.3">8.3</a>.  Remote Domain</span>

   If the domainpart of the address contained in the 'to' attribute of
   an outbound stanza does not match a configured domain of the server
   itself, then the rules provided in Section 10.4 of [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>] apply.

      Interoperability Note: <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a> specified how to use the _im._xmpp
      and _pres._xmpp SRV records [<a href="#ref-IMP-SRV" title='"Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence"'>IMP-SRV</a>] as a fallback method for
      discovering whether a remote instant messaging and presence
      service communicates via XMPP.  Because those SRV records have not
      been widely deployed, this document no longer specifies their use,
      and new implementations are not encouraged.

   If the domainpart of the JID contained in the 'to' attribute matches
   one of the configured domains of the server, the domain is serviced
   by the server itself (not by a specialized local service), and the
   JID is of the form &lt;domainpart&gt; or &lt;domainpart/resourcepart&gt;, the
   rules defined in [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>] apply.

   If the 'to' address specifies a bare JID &lt;localpart@domainpart&gt; or
   full JID &lt;localpart@domainpart/resourcepart&gt; where the domainpart of
   the JID matches a configured domain that is serviced by the server
   itself, the server MUST proceed as follows.

   If the user account identified by the 'to' attribute does not exist,
   how the stanza is processed depends on the stanza type.

   o  For an IQ stanza, the server MUST return a &lt;service-unavailable/&gt;
      stanza error to the sender.

   o  For a message stanza, the server MUST either (a) silently ignore
      the message or (b) return a &lt;service-unavailable/&gt; stanza error to
      the sender.

   o  For a presence stanza with no 'type' attribute or a 'type'
      attribute of "unavailable", the server MUST silently ignore the
      stanza.

   o  For a presence stanza of type "subscribe", "subscribed",
      "unsubscribe", or "unsubscribed", the server MUST silently ignore
      the stanza.

   o  For a presence stanza of type "probe", the server MUST either (a)
      silently ignore the stanza or (b) return a presence stanza of type
      "unsubscribed".

   For a message stanza of type "normal":

   o  If all of the available resources have a negative presence
      priority then the server SHOULD either (a) store the message
      offline for later delivery or (b) return a stanza error to the
      sender, which SHOULD be &lt;service-unavailable/&gt;.

   o  If there is one available resource with a non-negative presence
      priority then the server MUST deliver the message to that
      resource.

   o  If there is more than one resource with a non-negative presence
      priority then the server MUST either (a) deliver the message to
      the "most available" resource or resources (according to the
      server's implementation-specific algorithm, e.g., treating the
      resource or resources with the highest presence priority as "most
      available") or (b) deliver the message to all of the non-negative
      resources.

   For a message stanza of type "chat":

   o  If the only available resource has a negative presence priority
      then the server SHOULD either (a) store the message offline for
      later delivery or (b) return a stanza error to the sender, which
      SHOULD be &lt;service-unavailable/&gt;.

   o  If the only available resource has a non-negative presence

      resource or resources with the highest presence priority as "most
      available") or (b) deliver the message to all of the non-negative
      resources that have opted in to receive chat messages.

   For a message stanza of type "groupchat", the server MUST NOT deliver
   the stanza to any of the available resources but instead MUST return
   a stanza error to the sender, which SHOULD be &lt;service-unavailable/&gt;.

   For a message stanza of type "headline":

   o  If the only available resource has a negative presence priority
      then the server MUST silently ignore the stanza.

   o  If the only available resource has a non-negative presence
      priority then the server MUST deliver the message to that
      resource.

   o  If there is more than one resource with a non-negative presence
      priority then the server MUST deliver the message to all of the
      non-negative resources.

   For a message stanza of type "error", the server MUST silently ignore
   the message.

   However, for any message type the server MUST NOT deliver the stanza
   to any available resource with a negative priority; if the only
   available resource has a negative priority, the server SHOULD handle
   the message as if there were no available resources or connected
   resources as described under <a href="#section-8.5.2.2">Section 8.5.2.2</a>.

   The following table summarizes the message (not stanza) delivery
   rules described earlier in this section.  The left column shows
   various combinations of conditions (non-existent account, no active
   resources, only one resource and it has a negative presence priority,
   only one resource and it has a non-negative presence priority, or
   more than one resource and each one has a non-negative presence
   priority) and 'to' addresses (bare JID, full JID matching an
   available resource, or full JID matching no available resource).  The
   subsequent columns list the four primary message types (normal, chat,
   groupchat, or headline) along with six possible delivery options:
   storing the message offline (O), bouncing the message with a stanza
   error (E), silently ignoring the message (S), delivering the message
   to the resource specified in the 'to' address (D), delivering the
   message to the "most available" resource or resources according to
   the server's implementation-specific algorithm, e.g., treating the
   resource or resources with the highest presence priority as "most
   available" (M), or delivering the message to all resources with non-
   negative presence priority (A -- where for chat messages "all
   resources" can mean the set of resources that have explicitly opted
   in to receiving every chat message).  The '/' character stands for
   "exclusive or".  The server SHOULD observe the rules given in <a href="#section-8.1">section</a>
   <a href="#section-8.1">8.1</a> when choosing which action to take for a particular message.

   The addresses of XMPP entities as used in communication over an XMPP
   network (e.g., in the 'from' and 'to' addresses of an XML stanza)
   MUST NOT be prepended with a Uniform Resource Identifier [<a href="#ref-URI" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>URI</a>]
   scheme.

   However, an application that is external to XMPP itself (e.g., a page
   on the World Wide Web) might need to identify an XMPP entity either
   as a URI or as an Internationalized Resource Identifier [<a href="#ref-IRI" title='"Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)"'>IRI</a>], and an
   XMPP client might need to interact with such an external application
   (for example, an XMPP client might be invoked by clicking a link
   provided on a web page).  In the context of such interactions, XMPP
   clients are encouraged to handle addresses that are encoded as

   For internationalization considerations, refer to the relevant
   section of [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>].

   Core security considerations for XMPP are provided in Section 13 of
   [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>], including discussion of channel encryption,
   authentication, information leaks, denial-of-service attacks, and
   interdomain federation.

   Section 13.1 of [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>] outlines the architectural roles of
   clients and servers in typical deployments of XMPP, and discusses the
   security properties associated with those roles.  These roles have an
   impact on the security of instant messages, presence subscriptions,
   and presence notifications as described in this document.  In
   essence, an XMPP user registers (or has provisioned) an account on an
   XMPP server and therefore places some level of trust in the server to
   complete various tasks on the user's behalf, enforce security
   policies, etc.  Thus it is the server's responsibility to:

   1.  Preferably mandate the use of channel encryption for
       communication with local clients and remote servers.

   2.  Authenticate any client that wishes to access the user's account.

   3.  Process XML stanzas to and from clients that have authenticated
       as the user (specifically with regard to instant messaging and
       presence functionality, store the user's roster, process inbound
       and outbound subscription requests and responses, generate and
       handle presence probes, broadcast outbound presence
       notifications, route outbound messages, and deliver inbound
       messages and presence notifications).

   As discussed in Sections <a href="#section-13.1">13.1</a> and <a href="#section-13.4">13.4</a> of [<a href="#ref-XMPP-CORE" title="in particular the tradeoffs between (i) providing an acceptable level of service regarding stanza delivery and (ii) preventing directory harvesting attacks and presence leaks. However">XMPP-CORE</a>], even if the
   server fulfills the foregoing responsibilities, the client does not
   have any assurance that stanzas it might exchange with other clients
   (whether on the same server or a remote server) are protected for all
   hops along the XMPP communication path, or within the server itself.
   It is the responsibility of the client to use an appropriate

   technology for encryption and signing of XML stanzas if it wishes to
   ensure end-to-end confidentiality and integrity of its
   communications.

   Additional considerations that apply only to instant messaging and
   presence applications of XMPP are defined in several places within
   this document; specifically:

   o  When a server processes an inbound presence stanza of type "probe"
      whose intended recipient is a user associated with one of the
      server's configured domains, the server MUST NOT reveal the user's
      presence if the sender is an entity that is not authorized to
      receive that information as determined by presence subscriptions
      (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).

   o  A user's server MUST NOT leak the user's network availability to
      entities who are not authorized to know the user's presence.  In
      XMPP itself, authorization takes the form of an explicit
      subscription from a contact to the user (as described under
      <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).  However, some XMPP deployments might consider an
      entity to be authorized if there is an existing trust relationship
      between the entity and the user who is generating presence
      information (as an example, a corporate deployment of XMPP might
      automatically add the user's presence information to a private
      directory of employees if the organization mandates the sharing of
      presence information as part of an employment agreement).

   o  When a server processes an outbound presence stanza with no type
      or of type "unavailable", it MUST follow the rules defined under
      <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> in order to ensure that such presence information is not
      sent to entities that are not authorized to know such information.

   o  A client MAY ignore the &lt;status/&gt; element when contained in a
      presence stanza of type "subscribe", "unsubscribe", "subscribed",
      or "unsubscribed"; this can help prevent "presence subscription
      spam".

   This section provides detailed information about subscription states
   and server processing of subscription-related presence stanzas (i.e.,
   presence stanzas of type "subscribe", "subscribed", "unsubscribe",
   and "unsubscribed").

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.1.%20%20Defined%20States"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" name="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Defined States</span>

   There are four primary subscription states (these states are
   described from the perspective of the user, not the contact):

   None:  The user does not have a subscription to the contact's
      presence, and the contact does not have a subscription to the
      user's presence.

   To:  The user has a subscription to the contact's presence, but the
      contact does not have a subscription to the user's presence.

   From:  The contact has a subscription to the user's presence, but the
      user does not have a subscription to the contact's presence.

   Both:  Both the user and the contact have subscriptions to each
      other's presence (i.e., the union of 'from' and 'to').

      Implementation Note: For the purpose of processing subscription-
      related presence stanzas as described in the following sections, a
      subscription state of "None" includes the case of the contact not
      being in the user's roster at all, i.e., an unknown entity from
      the perspective of the user's roster.

   The foregoing states are supplemented by various sub-states related
   to pending inbound and outbound subscriptions, thus yielding nine
   possible subscription states:

   1.  "None" = Contact and user are not subscribed to each other, and
       neither has requested a subscription from the other; this is
       reflected in the user's roster by subscription='none'.

   2.  "None + Pending Out" = Contact and user are not subscribed to
       each other, and user has sent contact a subscription request but
       contact has not replied yet; this is reflected in the user's
       roster by subscription='none' and ask='subscribe'.

   3.  "None + Pending In" = Contact and user are not subscribed to each
       other, and contact has sent user a subscription request but user
       has not replied yet.  This state might or might not be reflected
       in the user's roster, as follows: if the user has created a

       roster item for the contact then the server MUST maintain that
       roster item and also note the existence of the inbound presence
       subscription request, whereas if the user has not created a
       roster item for the contact then the user's server MUST note the
       existence of the inbound presence subscription request but MUST
       NOT create a roster item for the contact (instead, the server
       MUST wait until the user has approved the subscription request
       before adding the contact to the user's roster).

   4.  "None + Pending Out+In" = Contact and user are not subscribed to
       each other, contact has sent user a subscription request but user
       has not replied yet, and user has sent contact a subscription
       request but contact has not replied yet; this is reflected in the
       user's roster by subscription='none' and ask='subscribe'.

   5.  "To" = User is subscribed to contact (one-way); this is reflected
       in the user's roster by subscription='to'.

   6.  "To + Pending In" = User is subscribed to contact, and contact
       has sent user a subscription request but user has not replied
       yet; this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='to'.

   7.  "From" = Contact is subscribed to user (one-way); this is
       reflected in the user's roster by subscription='from'.

   8.  "From + Pending Out" = Contact is subscribed to user, and user
       has sent contact a subscription request but contact has not
       replied yet; this is reflected in the user's roster by
       subscription='from' and ask='subscribe'.

   9.  "Both" = User and contact are subscribed to each other (two-way);
       this is reflected in the user's roster by subscription='both'.

   Outbound presence subscription stanzas enable the user to manage his
   or her subscription to the contact's presence (via the "subscribe"
   and "unsubscribe" types), and to manage the contact's access to the

   When the user's server receives a presence stanza of type

   is a pending outbound request for access to the contact's presence
   information and the inbound presence stanza of type "subscribed"
   results in a subscription state change, then the user's server MUST
   change the subscription state and MUST deliver the stanza to the
   user.  If the user already is subscribed to the contact's presence
   information, the inbound presence stanza of type "subscribed" does

   When the user's server receives a presence stanza of type
   "unsubscribed" for the user from the contact, if there is a pending
   outbound request for access to the contact's presence information or
   if the user currently is subscribed to the contact's presence
   information, then the user's server MUST change the subscription
   state and MUST deliver the stanza to the user.  Otherwise, the user's

   Based on consensus derived from implementation and deployment
   experience as well as formal interoperability testing, the following
   substantive modifications were made from [<a href="rfc3921.html" title='"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence"'>RFC3921</a>] (in addition to
   numerous changes of an editorial nature).

   o  The protocol for session establishment was determined to be
      unnecessary and therefore the content previously defined in
      <a href="rfc3921.html#section-3">Section 3 of RFC 3921</a> was removed.  However, for the sake of
      backward-compatibility server implementations are encouraged to
      advertise support for the feature, even though session
      establishment is a "no-op".

   o  In order to more seamlessly repair lack of synchronization in
      subscription states between rosters located at different servers,
      clarified and modified error handling related to presence
      subscription requests, presence probes and presence notifications.

   o  Changed the 'from' address for presence probes so that it is the
      bare JID, not the full JID.

   o  Adjusted and clarified stanza delivery rules based on
      implementation and deployment experience.

   o  Explicitly specified that a server is allowed to deliver a message
      stanza of type "normal" or "chat" to all resources if it has a
      method for allowing resources to opt in to such behavior.

   o  Allowed a server to use its own algorithm for determining the
      "most available" resource for the purpose of message delivery, but
      mentioned the recommended algorithm from <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a> (based on
      presence priority) as one possible algorithm.

   o  Added optional versioning of roster information to save bandwidth
      in cases where the roster has not changed (or has changed very
      little) between sessions; the relevant protocol interactions were
      originally described in [<a href="#ref-XEP-0237">XEP-0237</a>].

   o  Added optional server support for pre-approved presence
      subscriptions via presence stanzas of type "subscribed", including
      a new 'approved' attribute that can be set to "true" (for a pre-
      approved subscription) or "false" (the default).

   o  Added optional 'parent' attribute to &lt;thread/&gt; element.

   o  Moved the protocol for communications blocking (specified in
      <a href="rfc3921.html#section-10">Section 10 of RFC 3921</a>) back to [<a href="#ref-XEP-0016">XEP-0016</a>], from which it was
      originally taken.

   o  Recommended returning presence unavailable in response to probes.

   o  Clarified handling of presence probes sent to full JIDs.

   o  Explicitly specified that the default value for the presence
      &lt;priority/&gt; element is zero.

   o  Removed recommendation to support the "_im" and "_pres" SRV
      records.

   This document is an update to, and derived from, <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a>.  This
   document would have been impossible without the work of the
   contributors and commenters acknowledged there.

   Hundreds of people have provided implementation feedback, bug
   reports, requests for clarification, and suggestions for improvement
   since publication of <a href="rfc3921.html">RFC 3921</a>.  Although the document editor has
   endeavored to address all such feedback, he is solely responsible for
   any remaining errors and ambiguities.

   Some of the text about roster versioning was borrowed from
   [<a href="#ref-XEP-0237">XEP-0237</a>], and some of the text about message threads was borrowed
   from [<a href="#ref-XEP-0201">XEP-0201</a>].

   Special thanks are due to Kevin Smith, Matthew Wild, Dave Cridland,
   Waqas Hussain, Philipp Hancke, Florian Zeitz, Jonas Lindberg, Jehan
   Pages, Tory Patnoe, and others for their comments during Working
   Group Last Call.
