   UMSP is the network connection-oriented protocol.  It corresponds to
   session and presentation layers of model OSI.  The protocol is
   designed for implementation in a wide class of systems, from simple
   devices based on the dedicated processors, up to universal computers
   and clusters.

   For the data exchange, the protocol uses transport layer service with
   reliable delivery.  It is possible to use not providing reliable
   delivery protocol for the transmission of not requiring
   acknowledgement data.  This document describes use TCP and UDP.

   The creation of network environment for the organization 128-bit
   address space of memory distributed between Internet nodes is the
   basic purpose of the protocol UMSP.  The protocol defines algorithm
   of the connections management and format of network primitives.  It
   doesn't control local memory on the node.

   As against the traditional network protocols, the user applications
   on different nodes interact not by the network primitives exchanging
   or working with the dataflows, but by immediate data reading/write or
   control transfers to the code in virtual memory of the remote node.
   The user's application can know nothing about existence of the
   protocol and network, and simply use the instructions with 128-bit
   addresses.

   Firstly, it is supposed to use UMSP in systems based on the virtual
   machines (VM), executing the pseudo-code.  However, the protocol may
   be used in systems executing a processor code, for example, in
   clusters or in universal operational systems, for the organization of
   the distributed virtual address space.  Besides, the minimal profile
   of the protocol may be used in simple devices, which do not have the
   operational system.

   The protocol gives various means for set the connection parameters
   and allows building systems with a high protection level without
   restriction applications functionalities.

   UMSP can essentially simplify the distributed systems development
   process.  It gives an opportunity to unite not only information, but
   also calculating resources of the large number of polytypic computers
   without significant expenses for the programs standardization and
   development.

   UMSP is based on the 128-bit distributed address memory space model.
   The 128-bit address contains the information about the network type,
   network node address and local memory address.  It has the following
   format:

   Octets
    0      1                                                    16
   +------+--------------+--------------------+----------------+
   |Header|     FREE     |     NODE_ADDR      |    MEM_ADDR    |
   +------+--------------+--------------------+----------------+

   Complete address length is fixed and is equal to 16 octets.

   Header

      1 octet.  Address header field completely defines the address
      format.  The header has the following format:

      Bits
       0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
      |      ADDR_LENGTH      |  NET_TYPE | ADDR_CODE |
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

      ADDR_LENGTH

         4 bits.  The length of the network address.  This field
         contains the number of octets in the NODE_ADDR field.  The
         value 0 is not allowed.

      NET_TYPE

         2 bits.  The network type.  This field specifies a type of
         network, in which the node is.

      ADDR_CODE

         2 bits.  The length code of the local memory address.  The
         value of this field specifies the length of the local memory
         address.  The following values of the field and appropriated to
         them length of the field MEM_ADDR are defined:






<span class="grey">Bogdanov                      Experimental                      [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3018.html">RFC 3018</a>             Unified Memory Space Protocol         December 2000</span>


            %b00 - 16 bit
            %b01 - 24 bit
            %b10 - 32 bit
            %b11 - 64 bit

      The values combination of the three fields of heading is named
      address format number.  These fields unequivocally define a
      network, in which the node is located.  Format number writes as
      follows:

         N &lt;ADDR_LENGTH&gt; - &lt;NET_TYPE&gt; - &lt;ADDR_CODE&gt;

      For example, N 4-0-2 defines the address with length of the node
      network address 4 octets and memory address with the length 32
      bits.  The network type 0 for such address format is defined for
      the network IPv4 in the presented document.  If the network type
      is equal to zero, it may be missed during the writing of the
      address format number.  For example, format N 4-0-2 and 4-2 are
      equivalent.  If both fields NET_TYPE and ADDR_CODE are set to
      zero, they may be omitted.  Thus, a format number writes as one
      figure.

      One or several address format numbers must be assigned for each
      global network, included in unified system.

   FREE

      0 - 12 octets.  This field is unused by the protocol.  It may
      contain any additional information, which is necessary for the
      control system of the node memory.  If this field is not used, the
      zero value must be set in all octets.  Using of this field results
      that the network instructions must contain only complete 16 -
      octet address and the short address of local memory cannot be
      used.

   NODE_ADDR

      1 - 13 octets.  The node address.  The format of this field is
      defined separately for each address format number.  The field of
      the node address should not necessary precisely correspond to the
      real network address.  If the real network address is longer than
      this field, it is necessary to organize in the network a subset of
      supporting the protocol UMSP addresses.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3018.html">RFC 3018</a>             Unified Memory Space Protocol         December 2000</span>


   MEM_ADDR

      16/24/32/64 bits.  The address of local memory.  This field is the
      memory address in system, which is set by a field NODE_ADDR.  The
      node completely responds for its memory control.  The protocol
      does not define the order of using and format of this field.

   128-bit address for the user applications is one field.  The user
   code cannot know about a physical arrangement of addressed memory.

   The 128-bit memory address may be transmits between nodes, as the
   data, for example, in the buffer of function parameters, or in the
   instruction of copying the data.  Therefore, it must identify the
   given node from any other nodes unequivocal.

   Any certain algorithm, connecting real network and 128-bit address,
   does not exist.  All used address formats must be known beforehand.

   As UMSP has its own address space, it can unite several global
   networks.  The nodes can have internal local networks or subordinated
   addressable devices connected with the node by the not-network
   communications.  Any node by address format number must have an
   opportunity to define the gateway respond for routing of this
   address.

   Computing model is three-layer:

      (1) Job
      (2) Task
      (3) Thread of control

   The job corresponds to the user application.  The job is distributed
   and can simultaneously be executed on many nodes.  The job control is
   carried out centralize, from the node named as Job Control Point
   (JCP).  One JCP can control the some jobs.  JCP can be located on the
   same node, on which the job is created, or on any other addressed net
   point.

   The task is the job presentation on the separate node.  The task
   includes one or several computing threads of control.  The job has
   only one task on each node.

   The job is finished, when the appropriate user application is
   finished.  At the end of the job all tasks of this job on all nodes
   are finished.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3018.html">RFC 3018</a>             Unified Memory Space Protocol         December 2000</span>


   The job has its isolated 128-bit address space.  The address space is
   segmented.  A segment is the local memory of one node.  Besides, the
   protocol allows working with objects.  The objects are separate
   associative memory of the node.

   The task thread represents the concrete control thread, which are
   executed by VM in the certain node.  The thread can read and write to
   any address of 128-bit address space of the job.  The control
   transfer to the address from other (remote) node, results to the
   creation of the new thread on the remote node.  The continuous code
   segment cannot be distributed on several nodes.  In addition, it is
   impossible to receive continuous memory area distributed on several
   nodes.

   The protocol does not demand to support the different tasks of not-
   crossed memory space from the separate VM node.  The supporting of
   multi-thread is not also the obligatory requirement.

   The 128-bit Global Job Identifier (GJID) is defined by protocol.  It
   is assigned on JCP, which will control the job.  All active GJID have
   the unique values in the unified system at each moment of time.

   The job can contain VM code of different types.  Different types VM
   can be situated on one or different nodes.  The mechanism of
   association of different VM types in groups on one node is
   stipulated, so to the non-uniform code can be executed on one node in
   a context of one job.  The groups are described in details in <a href="#section-9">section</a>
   <a href="#section-9">9</a>.  VM, incorporated in groups, must work in common memory space (to
   have a common subsystem of memory control).

   One or several VM are working on upper level for UMSP.  The VM layer
   is not network level.  Last network level is UMSP.  Therefore, VM
   layer has no its own network primitives and uses together with UMSP
   the same field of operation code.

   The end services user of the protocol is the user code, which is
   executed by the virtual machine.  It has the instructions with the
   128-bit address.  VM translates these instructions to network
   commands, which are transmitted through the UMSP protocol for the
   executing by the remote machine.  Internal organization VM, command
   system and API can be anyone.  The protocol defines only format of
   primitives, which the virtual machines exchange through a network.

   The protocol does not control the jobs memory.  Control of memory
   should realize VM.  If a few VM works on one node, they may have the
   common memory space or may be completely isolated.

   UMSP uses the transport layer with reliable delivery for the data
   exchange.  This document defines of using TCP.  For the transfer of
   not requiring acknowledgement data may be used UDP.  Thus, the
   connection through TCP is obligatory.  Use of multiple connections
   TCP with multiplexing is supposed.  The control of transport
   connections is not the part of the UMSP protocol.

   The UMSP instructions do not contain network addresses of the
   receiver and sender.  The protocol requires that one address UMSP
   must correspond to the one transport layer address.  Accordingly, it
   is necessary to define unequivocal the node address on transport
   layer by the 128-bit address of memory.

   Except the TCP, it is possible to use other transport protocols or
   not network communications.  The following requirements are showed to
   them:

      o  Reliable delivery.  The transport layer must inform about
         delivery or its impossibility;
      o  The violation of a sequence of transmitted segments is allowed;
      o  The duplication of segments is not allowed;
      o  At emergency reload of nodes it is necessary to guarantee
         identification of segments concerning session connections,
         assigned up to reload;
      o  Use connectionless-mode is possible.

   VM is the independent program and the interaction with the protocol
   is necessary for it only when it executes the instructions with the
   128-bit address, concerning to other node.  VM can execute several

   user tasks.  Each task can contain several threads of control.  VM
   must be able to interpret the application instructions with the 128-
   bit address to one or several instructions of the UMSP protocol.

   The session connection opens between nodes for the data exchange.
   One connection is relational only with one job.  There may be several
   session connections for the different jobs simultaneously between two
   nodes.  Besides, the protocol provides the connectionless data
   exchange.

   The exchange between UMSP nodes can include the instructions of the
   following type:

      o  Immediate reading/write in memory;
      o  Requests of allocation/free memory;
      o  Comparison instructions;
      o  Call-subroutine and unconditional jump instructions;
      o  Synchronization instructions;
      o  Work with objects instructions - reading / writing in memory of
         objects and execution of objects procedures.

   UMSP does not trace the user control threads.  VM must provide itself
   the necessary order of performance of the instructions.

   The length of UMSP instructions does not depend on segment length of
   the transport layer.  The segmentation is provided for transfer of
   the long instructions.  The packing of the short instructions in one
   segment with a possibility of compression of headings is used for its
   transfer.  The minimal size of necessary for work segment is 6
   octets.  For realization of all functions, it is necessary 54 octets.

   The UMSP instruction includes the basic header, extension headers and
   operands.  All fields have variable length.

   +----------------+----------------------+------------------------+
   |     Header     |   Extension headers  |       Operands         |
   +----------------+----------------------+------------------------+

   The header contains operation code and the information necessary for
   the instruction interpretation.

   The optional extension headers contain the additional information,
   not defined in basic header.

   The operands contain instructions data.

   The instruction format allows calculating common instruction length,
   without knowing definition of separate operation code.

   The instructions headers provide for the short and extended format
   for maintenance of the effective protocol work in wide range of
   network speeds.  Besides, there is a simple algorithm of the headers
   compression.

   The all instructions and extension headers the identifiers are given
   which enter the name by upper case symbols.  The identifiers of the
   instructions begin with the letter.  The identifiers of the extension
   headers begin with underlining symbol.

   ASK

      1 bit.  The flag of response necessity.  This flag defines
      presence of field REQ_ID in header.  If ASK = 1, there is field
      REQ_ID in the instruction.  If EXT = 0, the field REQ_ID in the
      instruction are absent.

   PCK

      2 bits.  The Header compression attribute.  These bits are used
      for packing instructions headers transmitted on one connection TCP
      or for sending of the several instructions in one package UDP.
      Use of these bits is based on the assumption that two following in
      succession instructions concern to one session connection, or one
      chain, with a high probability.  The PCK bits have one of the
      following values:

      %b00 - The instruction does not belong to the definite session.
             The fields CHAIN_NUMBER, INSTR_NUMBER and SESSION_ID are
             absent in header of such instruction.
      %b01 - The given instruction concerns to the same session
             connection, as previous.  The field SESSION_ID in the
             instruction header is absent.
      %b10 - The given instruction belongs to the same connection and
             same chain, as previous.  The fields CHAIN_NUMBER,
             INSTR_NUMBER and SESSION_ID in header of such instruction
             are absent.  The INSTR_NUMBER value of the current
             instruction calculates by addition of one to INSTR_NUMBER
             value of the previous instruction.
      %b11 - The given instruction may does not concern to the same
             session, as previous.  The field SESSION_ID is present at
             it.  The presence of fields CHAIN_NUMBER and INSTR_NUMBER
             is defined by CHN flag.

   CHN

      1 bit.  The flag of chain.  Transmitted on one session connection
      and concerning one job instructions, may be unified in a chain.
      Chains are considered in details by <a href="#section-7">section 7</a>.  If SEQ = 1, the
      instruction is connected with chain and there are fields
      CHAIN_NUMBER and INSTR_NUMBER (if PCK is not set to %b10) at it.
      If bit CHN = 0, the instruction is not connected with chains and
      there are no fields CHAIN_NUMBER and INSTR_NUMBER in it.

   EXT

      1 bit.  The flag of extension headers presence in the instruction.
      If EXT = 1, there is one or more extension headers in the
      instruction.  If EXT = 0, the extension headers in the instruction
      are absent.

   OPR_LENGTH

      3 bits.  The number of 32 bit words in the operands field.  The
      value 0 defines absence of operands field.  The value %b111
      specifies use of the extended header format.  In the extended
      format, the length of operands is defined by the field
      OPR_LENGTH_EXT, and the field OPR_LENGTH is not used.

   OPR_LENGTH_EXT

      2 octets.  The number of 32 bit words in the operands field.  The
      field OPR_LENGTH_EXT is present in header, only if OPR_LENGTH =
      %b111.  If OPR_LENGTH &lt; &gt; %b111, the field OPR_LENGTH_EXT is
      absent.  If OPR_LENGTH_EXT = 0, the field of operands is absent.
      There are following reasons, on which it is necessary to use field
      OPR_LENGTH_EXT instead of OPR_LENGTH:

         (1) If operands length must be more than 24 octets
         (2) If making the fields alignment of 4 octets is more
             effective, than compression of header of 2 octets.

   CHAIN_NUMBER

      2 octets.  The number of chain.  This field contains number of
      chain, to which the given instruction concerns.  The values %x0000
      and %xFFFF are reserved.

   INSTR_NUMBER

      2 octets.  The instruction number.  This field contains the serial
      number of instruction in a chain.  The numbering begins with zero.
      Value %xFFFF is reserved.

   SESSION_ID

      4 octets.  It is the identifier of the session connection assigned
      by the instruction receiver.  During the session connection
      opening, each side sets its own identifier to connection and
      informs it to other side.  The zero value of this field specifies
      that the instruction does not concern to the definite session.
      The value %xFFFFFFFF is reserved.

   REQ_ID

      4 octets.  The request identifier.  It is uses for establishment
      of correspondence between requests and responds to it.

   Further, the identifier OPR_LENGTH is used at the description of the
   instructions format.  It means using of OPR_LENGTH_EXT field, if
   OPR_LENGTH = %b111.  The instruction with length of operands, which
   are not exceeding 24 octets, may be transmitted with header in the
   short format (OPR_LENGTH &lt; &gt; %b111) or in the extended format
   (OPR_LENGTH = %b111).  Both forms are equivalent.

   Minimal header length in the short format is 2 octets, in the
   extended format - 4 octets.  Maximal header length is 16 octets.

   If the EXT flag in the instruction header set to 1, the instruction
   contains from one up to thirty extension headers.  The extension
   headers are used for the following purposes:

   o  For sending of the service information which were not provided in
      the basic header.
   o  For sending of the data of length more than 262240 octets in one
      instruction.

   The extension headers have the following common format:

   HXT

      1 bit.  Specify length of the field of data length.  If HXT = 0,
      length of the extension header is defined by a field HEAD_LENGTH.
      The field HEAD_LENGTH_EXT in this case is absent.  If HXT = 1,
      length of header is defined by unification of fields HEAD_LENGTH
      and HEAD_LENGTH_EXT.

   HEAD_LENGTH

      7 bit.  The number of 16 bit words in DATA field.  If HXT = 0,
      this is independent field.  If HXT = 1, it is the senior bits of
      complete length field.

   HEAD_LENGTH_EXT

      3 octets.  The number of 16 bit words in DATA field.  If HXT = 0,
      this field is absent.  If HXT = 1, it is the younger bits of
      complete length field.

   HSL

      1 bit.  The flag of last header.  It is set to 1 for last
      extension header in the instruction.  In other extension headers,
      this flag is set to 0.

   HOB

      1 bit.  The flag of obligatory processing.  It defines the order
      of the instruction processing, if the receiving node does not know
      purpose of the extension header or cannot process it by any
      reason.  If HOB = 1, instruction must not be carried out.  If HOB
      = 0, it does not influence on the instruction processing.  The
      protocol must process all extension headers, irrespective of
      errors presence.

   HRZ

      1 bit.  The field is reserved for the future expansions.  This
      field must not be analyzed by the protocol on receiving.  It must
      be set to 0 at sending.

   HEAD_CODE

      5 bits.  If HXT = 0, the field contains the extension header code.
      If HXT = 1, this field joins the field HEAD_CODE_EXT.  It is the
      senior bits of the header code.

      younger bits of the header code.

   RESERVED

      2 octets.  If HXT = 0, this field is absent.  If HXT = 1, this
      field is reserved for further use.  The field RESERVED must not be
      analyzed by the protocol during the receiving in the current
      realization of the protocol.  It must be set to 0 at sending.

   DATA

      The data field of the extension header.  If HXT = 0, the length of
      field is 0 - 254 octets, if HXT = 1, the length is 0 - 4 * 10^9
      octets.  The format of this field is defined separately for each
      value of the header code.

   On the receiving side, the extension headers must be processed in
   that order, in what they follow in the instruction.  If the
   instruction contains more than 30 extension headers, it is considered
   erroneous.  It is necessary to break off the session connection, on
   which it was transmitted, after the reception of such instruction.

   The identifiers HEAD_LENGTH and HEAD_CODE are used further in the
   text at the description of the extended headers format.  It assumes
   using of fields HEAD_LENGTH + HEAD_LENGTH_EXT and HEAD_CODE +
   HEAD_CODE_EXT, if HXT = 1.  The headers with the code 0 - 30 can be
   sent in short (HXT = 0) and in extended (HXT = 1) format.

   Local memory address

      It is described in <a href="#section-2.1">section 2.1</a>.

   IP-address defines the nodes of the given type unequivocally.  The
   TCP is used for the interaction with such nodes.  For sending of not
   requiring response instructions, using UDP is allowed.  IANA has
   assigned ports TCP and UDP 2110.  This port must be open for the
   listening (receiving).  TCP node, initialing the connection opening,
   or the UDP node, carrying out the package sending, can use any port.
   Using several TCP connections with multiplexing is supposed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4%20%20Response%20of%20the%20Instructions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>  Response of the Instructions</span>

   The protocol instructions are divided into two types:

      (1)  The management instructions transmitted on UMSP layer (OPCODE
           = 1 - 112).
      (2)  The instructions of the exchange between VM (OPCODE = 128 -
           223).

   The processing of two types of the instructions differs as follows:

   o  The field of the identifier of request REQ_ID is formed by the
      protocol in the instructions of the first type, and it is formed
      by VM for the instructions of the second type.
   o  The protocol must analyze the field REQ_ID and compare it with the
      instructions, transmitted earlier, after receiving of the response
      instruction of the first type.
   o  The protocol must not analyze the field REQ_ID after receiving of
      the response instruction of the second type.  This instruction is
      simply sent to VM.

   The response instructions have the field ASK equal to 1.  It means,
   that the header have the field REQ_ID.  The value taken from the
   confirmed instruction is written into the field REQ_ID.  The response
   instruction does not require response.

   A few VM can be connected to the protocol on the node.  Everyone VM
   can work in its own address space.  The identifiers of requests for
   different VM can coincide.  Therefore, instruction is identified by
   two fields:

   o  The session identifier SESSION_ID, which is connected with
      definite VM.
   o  The request identifier REQ_ID.

   "Response" (RSP) and "Response of the protocol" (RSP_P) instructions
   have the identical format.  The difference is only in the operation
   code:

      OPCODE = 129/1  ; correspondingly to RSP/RSP_P
      ASK = 1
      PCK = %b01/11
      EXT = 0/1
      CHN = 0
      OPR_LENGTH = 0/1
      SESSION_ID and REQ_ID - The values is taken from the confirmed
                              instruction.
      Operands:
         2 octets: The basic return code.
         2 octets: The additional return code.
      The optional extension header:
         _MSG - contains the arbitrary error description.

   The instruction without operands is used for the positive response.
   It is equivalent to zero values of the field of the basic and
   additional return codes.

   The zero basic return code is used for positive response.  The
   additional return code may have non-zero value.

   The instruction with non-zero basic return code is used for negative
   response.  The basic return code defines the error category.  The
   additional return code identifies an error.

   The instruction RSP is formed upon the VM request.  The return codes
   must be received from VM.  If the protocol cannot deliver the
   requiring response instruction to VM, it forms negative response RSP
   independently.

   The instruction RSP_P is always formed at the UMSP layer.  If the
   protocol cannot define on what instruction the RSP_P is transmitted,
   nothing actions is executed.

   There can be a necessity to cancel sending after the part of the data
   have been already transmitted and have occupied the buffer on the
   reception side, by sending of the long fragmented instructions or
   transactions.  The protocol provides the instruction "The sending is
   canceled" (SND_CANCEL) for this purpose.  This instruction has the
   following fields value:

   The instruction SND_CANCEL is used for the cancel of the partially

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5%20%20Jobs%20Management"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>  Jobs Management</span>

   The jobs management includes the following functions:

   o  Initiation and completion of jobs;
   o  Initiation and completion of tasks;
   o  Opening and closing of session connections;
   o  Activity control of nodes.

   The instructions with OPCODE = 1 - 112 are used for jobs management.
   These instructions must be sent through TCP.  Use UDP is not allowed,
   even if the instructions do not demand response.

   UMSP bases on model with the centralized control of the separate job.
   The reason is that the pointers control is not obviously possible in
   the decentralized system.  Any task can be finished at any moment or
   the node can be reloaded.  There is no way guaranteeing the
   notification about in the decentralized system all other nodes, on
   which the job works.  As the job continues to exist - the task
   concerning the job can be initiated on the same node again.  This
   task can allocate new dynamic resources.  The addresses for the again
   allocated resources can be crossed with addresses of resources, which
   existed on the node before the task restart.  The old pointers can be
   kept on other nodes.  It may be the formally correct pointers, but
   they will actually specify other objects.  The uncontrollable work of
   the application can be consequence of such situation.





<span class="grey">Bogdanov                      Experimental                     [Page 21]</span></pre>

   UMSP solves this task as follows:

   o  It allows defining the node, on which the task was completed,
      precisely.
   o  If the task on the node is finished before end of the job, all
      nodes, on which the job is executed, are notified of it.
   o  The repeated task initialization on the node is allowed, while all
      nodes will receive the message about the first task end.

   The protocol does not control the pointers.  VM supervises the
   pointers correctness.  VM must have architecture, in which 128 - bit
   pointers are stored in special memory areas, for this purpose.  The
   protocol informs VM about the nodes, on which task have finished the
   work.  VM must make all pointers concerning such tasks, invalid.  It
   results in exclusive situations at the access under these pointers.
   If the application provides processing exceptions, it keeps the
   capacity for work, or it is finished emergency.  Such decision allows
   excluding unguided applications working.

   For the decision of the specified questions at UMSP level, the
   control job node is defined for each job.  It names Job Control Point
   (JCP).  It may be the same node, on which the job is initiated, or it
   can be another dedicated node.  The basic JCP function is to trace
   the initialization and the end of the job tasks.  Besides, the
   dedicated JCP node may be used for the centralized users
   identification and the attack protection.

   The following identifiers are definite for the jobs and tasks
   control:

   o  Locally Task Identifier (LTID) is assigned to each active task on
      the node.  LTID length is equal to the length of local memory
      address defined for the node.  All LTID on the node must give
      unique values at each moment of time.  It is allowed to establish
      LTID, used earlier in the already completed tasks, for the again
      initiated tasks.
   o  JCP assigned the Control Task Identifier (CTID) to each task of
      the job.  Its length is equal to length of the local address
      memory on the node JCP.  All CTID on the JCP must give unique
      values at each moment of time.  As against LTID, the CTID value is
      chosen with some restrictions.
   o  Globally Task Identifier (GTID) is assigned to each task.  GTID
      has the same format, as the 128 - bit address of node memory has.
      The address of local memory is replaced on LTID in it.
   o  Globally Job Identifier (GJID) is assigned to the each job.  GJID
      is defined on the JCP node.  It has the same format, as the 128 -
      bit address of node JCP memory has.  The address of local memory

      is replaced on CTID of the first (initial) task of the job in it.
      GJID is used in the procedure of session connection opening for
      the definition JCP, which controls the job.

   LTID and CTID are written at the instructions in the field of length
   2/4/8 octets.  If the allocated for identifier field in the
   instruction is longer than identifier, LTID (CTID) writes in the last
   octets.  In the initial octets, the value 0 must be written.  If
   received LTID (CTID) is shorter than the local memory address, it is
   necessary to pad it with the zero octets in the beginning.

   GTID and GJID are written at the instructions in the field of length
   4-16 octets.  The field FREE is not present at these identifiers (see
   <a href="#section-2.1">section 2.1</a>).  It is considered, that it contains the zero-value
   octets.  Length of the identifier is defined in header of the
   address.

   By sending of instructions CONTROL_REQ, TASK_REG and SESSION_OPEN,
   the protocol uses timeout.  The value of timeout is assigned by node
   and must be more than three intervals of the maximal time of delivery
   at the transport layer.  The timeout is not influenced the waiting
   period in queue to the transport layer.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1%20%20%20%20Job%20Initiate"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>    Job Initiate</span>

   The job concerns to the user application executed on VM.  The UMSP
   job initialization can be made simultaneously with the application
   user start or during its working.

   The task, appropriated to its job, is initialized on the node
   together with the job.  LTID is binding to this task.

   If the node, on which the user application was loaded, is chosen for
   JCP, the question of the job initialization lays beyond the scope of
   the network protocol.

   Other node can be chosen as JCP for the following reasons:

   o  The job initialization node is connected to network by slow-speed
      or overloaded channel.  It is undesirable to send the managing
      traffic.
   o  The node has no computing possibilities for conducting the
      managing tables.
   o  The authentication on the detailed node is necessary.

   If the other node is chosen for JCP, the node, that initiates the
   job, must register the job at JCP.

   The job is executed on several nodes simultaneously.  The task,
   appropriate to it, must be initialized on each node.  There is
   corresponding only one task to one job on the node.  Each task must
   be connected only with one job.

   The task is initiated together with the job on the node, which had
   created the job.  On the other nodes, the task is initiated during
   the receiving of the first request on the opening of the session
   connection, which is appropriate to the job.  The request about
   openings of session connection contains GJID.  GJID contains the JCP
   address.  It is necessary to receive the sanction from JCP for the
   task start.  If the request about the opening of session has been
   received from JCP node, it is not necessary to request the sanction.

   The session connection is established between two tasks of one job.
   The connection is established under the VM initiative and it is used
   for the exchange of the instructions between VM.

   One session connection must be connected only with one task on the
   node.  The task may have several connections with different nodes.
   Between two nodes must be only one session connection with one GJID.

   The request about the establishment of session connection contains
   the global identifier of the job GJID.  If the node receives the
   request about the establishment of connection with GJID, which is not
   presented on the given node, VM must create a new task.  If the task
   has been already initialized, the new task is not created.

   The session connection needs to be established over TCP.  After the
   connection is established, the sending of the instructions, which are
   not require of execution response, is possible through UDP.  One TCP
   connection may be used by several session connections.  One session
   connection may use several TCP connections.

   The protocol allows working without the establishment of session
   connection.  The node must have VM by default, which must execute the
   instructions without the establishment of connection.

   At the establishment of session connection, the sides agree about the
   used VM type and the subset of the protocol functions.  The session
   connection UMSP may be asymmetrical.  It means, that two sides of one
   connection can be connected with VM of the different type and provide
   the different subset of the protocol functions.

   If at an establishment of session connection the zero-type VM is
   used, it specifies group VM (see <a href="#section-9">section 9</a>).  The zero-value of
   realization VM is not allowed.

   The procedure of the establishment of session connection may contain
   from 2-way up to 8-way handshakes.

   It is possible to refuse connection on any step.  It is necessary
   either to confirm connections, or to refuse it on the eighth step.

   Let node A is the initiator of the establishment of a session, and
   the node B is the second side of connection.  The node A must send
   the instruction SESSION_CLOSE for closing session.  The node A may
   recommence sending of the instructions after sending of this

   instructions of response (see <a href="#section-6">section 6</a>) does not influence on the
   closing of connection.  The node, which has sent SESSION_CLOSE, does
   not use the timeout and can be waiting for the response beyond all
   bounds long.

   The node B, after reception of the instruction SESSION_CLOSE, sends
   in the answer the instruction RSP_P.  The zero basic return code
   responds closing session.  The non-zero basic return code cancels
   closing session.  After sending of positive response, the node must
   not use connection during 30-second timeout.  If the instruction
   SESSION_ABEND or any other instruction, except response instruction,
   has not been received from the node A after the expiration of this

   o  The node finishes the work;
   o  If VM has accepted such decision for the internal reasons.

   The references to the resources allocated by the task can be on any

   can be not notified about it.  The fact of breaking or repeated
   establishment of transport connection cannot be the indicator of
   disconnect or restart of the node.  The control of transport
   connections is not the part of the UMSP protocol and the presence of
   transport connection is not obligatory.

   Besides the separate task on the node can be finished emergency.
   Procedure described in <a href="#section-5.5.1">section 5.5.1</a> in this case must be executed.
   If this procedure cannot be executed, must is abnormally finished
   work of the node.

   The JCP executes the functions of the control of nodes activity.  The
   instruction of request of the status TASK_REQ is sent periodically
   between tasks on nodes and JCP for this purpose.

   The following actions JCP are possible at detection of deactivating
   of the node:

   (1)  If the task initiated the job was finished, it is considered,
        that the job is completed.  JCP sends the instruction
        JOB_COMPLETED_INFO to all other nodes, on which the job was
        executed.
   (2)  JCP sends the instruction TASK_TERMINATE_INFO to all other nodes
        of the job, if the task, which has not initiated the job, is
        finished.

   The deactivating of the JCP node imposes the restriction on GJID
   appropriated by it after reloading.  The following variants are
   probable:

   (1)  The disconnection of the JCP node passed normally.  It
        transferred to all nodes, which it has controlled, instruction
        JOB_COMPLETED_INFO.  In this case, it can appropriate anyone
        GJID after reloading.
   (2)  There is the emergency disconnect of the JCP node.  It has not
        informed all nodes about the deactivating.  In this case, it
        must guarantee after reloading, that new GJID will not concur
        witch the GJID, existing up to the reload, during two maximal
        intervals of inactivity time (which sets this JCP).

   The reload of nodes, which are not being JCP, does not impose
   restrictions on LTID established on these nodes.

         intervals, through which the activity of the node - sender of
         the instruction from the side JCP - will be checked.

   The inaction period must be more than three intervals of the maximal
   time of delivery at the transport layer.  The waiting period in queue
   to the transport layer does not influence on timeout.

   The header _INACTION_TIME may be attached to the following
   instructions:

   (1)  To the instruction TASK_REG.  In this case must be satisfied
        condition - on node there must not be other active tasks, which
        are controlled the JCP of addressee.  The zero-value specifies
        that the activity checking is unused.  The absence of the header
        specifies that the inaction period must be set on the JCP.
   (2)  To the instruction TASK_REJECT, if the time from the instruction
        TASK_REG does not fit for JCP.
   (3)  To the instruction TASK_CONFIRM, if instruction TASK_REG had no
        this header.

   If JCP receives the instruction TASK_REG with the attached heading
   _INACTION_TIME, it must check up presence of active tasks with sender
   node (as it can mean, that the node was reloaded).  If such tasks
   exist, for each of them it is necessary to execute procedure of end
   of the task described in <a href="#section-5.6.2">section 5.6.2</a>.  The instruction TASK_CONFIRM

   The instruction STATE_REQ will be sent in the defined task but it has
   concern with node.  It is sent, if between the node and JCP was not
   sending of the instruction during inactive time.  The task activated
   after sending of last instruction STATE_REQ does not influence the
   control of activity.

   The instruction TASK_STATE is sent in reply to STATE_REQ.  At
   expectation of the response, the timeout equal to one inaction period
   is used.  After the expiration of the timeout the node is considered
   switched - off.

   If the node not receives of any instructions from JCP during two
   intervals of inaction time, it is considered, that JCP has finished
   the work.  The actions of the node in this case are described in

   The instruction "The node was reloaded" (NODE_RELOAD) is sent to JCP
   as the negative response to STATE_REQ instruction.  NODE_RELOAD has
   the following values of fields:

      OPCODE = 23
      PCK = %b00
      CHN = 0

                     STATE_REQ.

   The instruction RELOAD_NODE indicates, that the task with given LTID
   for given JCP on the node is absent.  At reception of this
   instruction, JCP must make the following:

   (1)  To send the instruction STATE_REQ to all tasks of the node,
        which were initiated before a sending of the penultimate
        instruction STATE_REQ.
   (2)  To wait for ending of one inaction interval after sending of the
        last instruction STATE_REQ (on which the negative response is
        received).
   (3)  To send the instructions STATE_REQ to all tasks of the node,
        which were initiated between last and penultimate instructions
        STATE_REQ (not including instructions from item 1).

   For all instructions STATE_REQ the positive response (TASK_STATE) or
   negative response (RELOAD_NODE) must be transmitted.

   The protocol provides the data exchange between nodes without an
   establishment of session connection.  In this case, initialization of
   the job and tasks is not made and JCP is not used.

   The format of the instructions, transmitted without the establishment

   transmitted by session connections.  The difference is that the field
   SESSION_ID has zero value or PCK = %b00.

   The node, supporting work without the establishment of session
   connection, must have VM, which executes by default the instructions
   transmitted without the establishment of connection.  In fact, these
   instructions are executed within the framework of a so-called zero-
   session (or zero-task) of this VM.  The memory address space of this
   VM is accessible without a connection establishment.

   The instruction SESSION_INIT with SESSION_ID = 0 and REQ_ID = 0
   allows to specify parameters of its zero-session and to request the
   zero-session parameters of the addressee node.  If the node, which
   has received such instruction, provides the requiring profile, it
   sends the instruction SESSION_ACCEPT.  If the profile is not
   provided, the answerback instruction SESSION_INIT will send, in which
   the field SESSION_ID and REQ_ID also have the value 0.  Actually,
   such instructions of session initialization do not establish
   connection, but have the information meaning.  The exchange of the
   data by zero-session can occur irrespective of its.

   There are the following restrictions at working without connection:

   o  The chain must be sent, only if it is completely located in one
      segment of the transport layer.
   o  It is impossible to request an allocation of memory and to create
      objects (except instruction MVRUN).  This objects is not adhered
      to the definite job and is not automatically release the resources
      at the end of the job, which has created them.
   o  Parameters of functions and the returned values must not contain
      the pointers, because the node can be reloaded at any moment.  It
      will result that the pointers will become invalid or will address
      other objects.

   The protocol cannot check those conditions.  Their realization lays
   on VM wholly.

   The work without establishment of session connection may be used in
   the following systems:

   o  In simple devices, which do not have the operational system;
   o  On servers which are executed a plenty of requests (for work
      without connection of resources is used less);
   o  In systems requiring the fast response to rare requests (if
      keeping of connection is inexpedient).

   The instructions intended for an exchange between VM uses values
   OPCODE in range 128 - 223.  Depending on length of the operands
   field, several formats of the instruction may be defined for one
   OPCODE.  The complete instruction format is defined by aggregate of
   the values of fields OPCODE and OPR_LENGTH.

   The instruction has the field REQ_ID, if in the instruction header
   flag ASK = 1.  REQ_ID is used for the response identification.  The
   value of this field is specifies by VM.  The response is formed by
   VM, too.  The protocol does not check the response and does not
   analyze the value of the field REQ_ID for the instructions of
   exchange between VM.  One of the instructions RSP, DATA, RETURN,
   ADDRESS, OBJECT or PROC_NUM is used for sending of the response.  The
   instructions of response have ASK = 1 and the value taken from the
   confirmed instruction is record in REQ_ID.  The instructions of
   response do not require the response.

   The instructions of exchange between VM may be sent through UDP at
   observance of the following conditions:

   o  ASK = 0;
   o  The instruction is located in one segment UDP;

   The timeouts and the repeated sending are not used at UMSP layer for
   instructions of exchange between VM.  It is explained to, that the
   time of sending instructions with low priority may be very large
   because of the output queues.  Therefore, the VM must make a decision
   on timeout, as only VM has the complete information on type of the
   transmitted data.  Besides, the transport layer protocol must use the
   timeouts.

   A few VM may be connected to the protocol on the node.  VM may
   simultaneously execute several jobs.  Each job may work in its
   address space.  The protocol determines VM and job, which the
   received instruction must transfer to, on field SESSION_ID value.

   The local memory address is located in the instruction in field of
   length 2/4/8 octets.  If memory address length in the instruction is
   not equal to memory address length defined for the node, the
   following variants are possible:

   o  If memory address length is set in 24 bits for the node, the
      address is writes in the end of 4 - octets field.  The 0 value
      sets in an initial (zero) octet.

   o  If the instruction format assumes the memory address length not
      less than 4 octets, 2-octet address is located in the last octets.
      The first 2 octets must set to zero.
   o  If instruction is the member of a chain and it has the less length
      of the memory address, than it is defined for the node - it is
      considered, that the base-displacement addressing is used.  If the
      value of the memory base is not assigned for the chain -
      instruction is erroneous.
   o  If the instruction is not the member of a chain and has the length
      of memory address less, than it is defined for the node, it is
      considered, that the abbreviated address is used.  The complete
      address length must be received by padding in front of it the
      necessary number of zero-value octets.
   o  In all other cases, the instruction is erroneous.

   Complete 128-bit memory address writes in operands in the 16-octets
   field.  The reason of using of the complete address is that the
   additional information, using by the memory control subsystem in the
   node, may contain in its field FREE (see <a href="#section-2.1">section 2.1</a>).  If the FREE
   of the complete address is set to zero, it is recommended to use
   local address in operands.

   Operands field has a length, which is an integral number of 32 bits.
   The alignment is making by padding, if necessary, of the zero-value
   octets at the end of the field.

   Header fields of the instructions not defined in the formats
   description are used according to the description from <a href="#section-3">section 3</a>.

   The instruction of the transfer control JUMP, CALL, CALL_BNUM and
   CALL_BNAME may contain the information about VM of the sender.  If VM
   type and VM version of the sender are contains in the instruction,
   the call parameters are formed in a format VM of the sender.  Else,
   the call parameters have format defined by VM of the addressee.  The
   code is always connected with of specific VM.

   All instructions of the protocol work with binary data and do not
   provide operations of formats transformation.

                   field.
         4 - 262134 octets: The immediate data are the parameters of a
                            call.

   On the reception side the processing of the instructions of a control
   transfer occurs as follows:

   o  The memory address is checked.  If it has erroneous value, the
      negative response RSP is sent.  At this stage, the correctness of
      parameters of a call may be also checked up.
   o  If the memory address and the parameters of a call have correct
      value, the positive response RSP is sent for the instruction JUMP.
      The transmitting side considers the instruction JUMP executed
      after receiving response.
   o  For response of an execution of the instruction CALL the
      instruction RETURN is sent.  The instruction RETURN may contain
      the returned values.  If there is an exception condition in a
      thread of control created by the CALL instruction, the instruction
      RSP with a non-zero basic return code is sent instead of RETURN.

   The instruction "Return of control" (RETURN) is used at return of
   control from the instructions CALL, MVRUN, CALL_BNUM and CALL_BNAME
   (see below).  Those instructions have the following values of fields:

      OPCODE = 147
      OPR_LENGTH = 0 - 65535  ; Depends on length of the immediate data.
      Operands:
         0 - 262140 octets: Immediate data returned from the subroutine.

   If it is not required to send returned value, the instruction RETURN
   does not contain operands. The data format coincides with the
   instruction, for which the response (format VM of the sender or
   addressee) will be sent.

   UMSP gives means for division of memory for a code and for the data.
   The protocol does not make checks of correctness of operations with
   memory.  The code and the data use common address space.  The control
   of memory is completely realized by VM.

                            multiple of two octets.
         2 - 131068 octets: A mask for comparison.  Length of this field
                            is equal to length of a field of the initial
                            data.

   The tracking data is set by the memory address in the first operand.
   These data are originally compared to the initial data value from the
   second operand.  If the values do not coincide, it is considered,
   that the data have changed.  The third operand allows setting a mask
   for comparison.  Set to one bits of the mask specifies bits in the
   data, which change must be traced.

   The following variants of the answer are probable on the instruction:

   o  If the address of local memory is incorrect, the instruction RSP
      with the non-zero basic return code is sent for the response.
   o  If the data do not change, in the response nothing is sent.
   o  If the data have changed, the instruction DATA with new value of
      the traced data is sent.

   The protocol has a set of the instructions being expansion of the
   protocol RPC [<a href="#ref-6" title='"RPC: Remote Procedure Call Protocol Specification Version 2"'>6</a>].  As against RPC, UMSP allows immediately to address
   memory on remote nodes and to send the pointers in parameters and
   returned values.

   The UMSP object is identified by the 4-octet number.  The values are
   divided into the following ranges:

        I -&gt; %x00000000 - 1FFFFFFF   are assigned for standard objects
       II -&gt; %x20000000 - 3FFFFFFF   are assigned for users objects
      III -&gt; %x30000000 - 4FFFFFFF   free
       IV -&gt; %x50000000 - DFFFFFFF   transient
        V -&gt; %xE0000000 - FFFFFFFF   reserved

   The objects from a range I must be definite, as standard, and the
   specifications of their interfaces must be published.  The protocol
   does not suppose the private or not described interfaces of standard
   objects.

   The objects from a range II must be registered, but the
   specifications of their interfaces may be optional published.  These
   numbers are applied in cases, when it is required to exclude the
   probable conflict of systems of the different manufacturers.

   The range III can be used freely.  The objects accessible on these
   numbers may be created statically or dynamically.  These objects can
   have any interfaces.

   All objects, concerning ranges I, II and III, is common for all jobs
   on the node, including zero-session.  Their interfaces are accessible
   to all tasks on the node, depending on parameters of authentication.

   The range IV is intended for objects created dynamically within the
   framework of one job.  These objects are the isolated associative
   memory of the job.  The access to these objects must be granted only
   for one job.  The zero-session has no access to these objects.

   The protocol grants the access to the data of object, as to the
   continuous segment of memory.  The memory of objects may be
   overlapping or no overlapping with flat local memory of the node.
   The offset field is used in the instructions of work with the data of
   object.  The offset rules writing are similar to the local address
   rules writing.

   The address memory length of the node, definite for the UMSP
   protocol, limits the maximal data size of one object.  The
   instructions definite in the given section, allow to work with
   associative memory with the theoretical limiting size on one node -
   2^96 (7,9 * 10^28) Byte.

   In addition to the number, the object has the version, 2 octets
   length, and realization, 2 octets length.  The protocol requires
   obligatory compatibility from bottom-up for all realizations of one
   version of object.  The publication of new realization of standard
   object may contain only added interfaces.

   If for the sender of the instruction the version and/or the
   realization of object do not play any role or is unknown, the
   instruction may contain zero fields of the version and realization of
   object or only zero field of realization.  The zero field of the
   version and non-zero field of realization are not allowed.

   for deallocation of dynamic resources.  The specified requirements
   impose essential restrictions on these objects.  The protocol does
   not impose any restrictions on objects from the range IV.

   Unique key identifying object on node, is number of object.  To

         _NAME - Contains the name of object.  This header is optional.

   The instruction NEW_SYS is used for the creation of object accessible
   from any job, NEW - for creation of object accessible only from its
   job.  If the object is created, the instruction OBJECT is sent for
   the response.  If the object cannot be created, the instruction RSP
   with the non-zero basic return code is sent.

   The immediate data field is transparent for the protocol.  It is
   formed by the sender VM and it must contain the information, which is
   necessary to the addressee VM for the creation of object.  Data must
   not simultaneously be sent in operands and in the extension header.

   The field SESSION_ID of the instruction cannot have the zero value.
   The dynamic object must be created only in the context of the
   definite job.  The object is always created on VM, with which the
   session is connected.

   o  The sequence.
   o  The transaction
   o  The fragmented instruction.

   If the instruction is included into a chain, the flag CHN should be
   equal 1.  The field CHAIN_NUMBER of header contains number of a
   chain, INSTR_NUMBER - serial instruction number in a chain, since 0.
   The numbering of chains is conducted by the protocol.  In one session
   simultaneously can be transferred up to 65533 chains.  Values of
   numbers of chains %x0000 and %xFFFF reserved by the protocol.  One
   chain can contain up to 65535 instructions.

   The instruction with a zero serial number INSTR_NUMBER should contain
   the extension header describing a chain.  Each type of a chain has
   own initiating extension header.

   _END_CHAIN.  The extension header "End of the chain" is transferred
   in last instruction of chain, irrespective of type of the chain.  It
   has the following values of fields:

      HEAD_CODE = 6
      HEAD_LENGTH = 0
      HOB = 1

   Number of a finished chain contains in a field CHAIN_NUMBER of the
   instruction header, to which the extension header is attached.

   Due to this, it is possible for one computing control thread not to
   wait for the current instruction positive end and to transfer
   following at once.

         1 bit.  The flag of execution after sending.  If TRR = 1, the
         transaction must be executed after sending of all instructions,
         of which it is consists, at once.  Such transaction is executed
         after reception of the instruction with the extension header
         _END_CHAIN.  If TRR = 0, it is necessary to transfer the
         special instruction EXEC_TR of transaction acknowledgement for
         its execution.

      TRT

         1 bit.  The flag of special processing.  It is entered for a
         possibility of the further expansion of the protocol.  If TRT =
         1, before transaction execution it is necessary to make some
         additional actions above the instructions, of which it is
         consists, for example to decipher.  These actions can be
         definite in the additional extension headers transmitted in the
         transaction instructions.  The given document will not define
         cases of use of this flag.  The value TRT must be zero.

      Reserve

         Must be set to 0.

      TIME_TR

         1 octet.  Time of transaction life in 2 - second intervals
         (maximal lifetime - 8 minutes).  The receiving side begins
         readout of this time after receiving all transaction
         instructions.  The value %x00 sets transaction without
         restriction of lifetime.

   In the last instruction of transaction the header, _END_CHAIN is
   always sent.

   UMSP is designed for work with the transport protocol with the
   limited size of transmitted data segment.  The fragmentation of the
   instructions is made in the following two cases:

   (1)  If the instruction is longer than the maximal segment size of
        transport layer or,
   (2)  If the segment is formed of the several instructions and last
        instruction is not located in it completely.

   The decision on fragmentation is taken to UMSP level.

   The fragmented instruction is encapsulated in several NOP
   instructions.  Then all instructions NOP are transmitted, as one
   chain of special type.  The following algorithm is used during
   encapsulation:

   (1)  The fields SESSION_ID and REQ_ID from the fragmented instruction
        are written in the first NOP instruction.  If field REQ_ID is
        not present in the initial instruction, it must not be in the
        NOP instruction.  The field SESSION_ID always is present in the
        fragmented instructions.
   (2)  Then these fields delete from the initial instruction.  The
        value of all other fields of the header does not change.
   (3)  After that, the initial instruction is divided into fragments of
        necessary length.  Each fragment is located in a field of
        operands of the NOP instruction.  Other data should not be
        entered in operand field.

   _BEGIN_FRG.  The extension header "The first fragment" is transmitted
   to the NOP instruction, which contains the first fragment.  It has
   the following values of fields:

      HEAD_CODE = 5
      HEAD_LENGTH = 0/2 ; Depends on subordination of the chain.

   In the given item, the buffering used by the protocol on receiving of
   data is described.  The question of buffering on sending lies beyond
   the scope of the protocol.

   If the instruction is not include in a chain, it is transmitted to VM
   for execution at once and does not require buffering at the protocol
   level.  The interface UMSP - VM must provide asynchronous
   instructions sending.  It is recommended, that the productivity of
   UMSP systems, should allow to process the instructions accepted from
   network, with that speed, with what they were received.  All
   instructions are designed so that carries out the known and limited
   computing loading.  Exception is the instruction of control
   transfers, which must be processed in two stages.  The instruction
   correctness is checked firstly and its scheduling is made.  Then the
   instruction is executed.  At that must be guaranteed that the
   protocol can receive such part of processor time, which would allow
   it to work in stationary mode.  Therefore, the questions of node
   overload are deduced on VM layer and user applications layer, where
   they can be sensible controlled.



<span class="grey">Bogdanov                      Experimental                     [Page 67]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3018.html">RFC 3018</a>             Unified Memory Space Protocol         December 2000</span>


   For chains, the protocol provides two schemes of buffering during the
   receiving:

   (1)  At the session connection establishment, the sides agree about
        the allocated buffer ("window") size.  The window always is more
        than the maximal segment of a transport layer.  The transmitting
        side can expect for this buffer without the preliminary
        coordination with the receiving side.  The window size is
        established single for each session connection, and cannot be
        changed in subsequent.  UMSP is designed for using of transport
        layer, which informs about the data delivery.  Therefore
        transmitting side traces the current free size of the window on
        the reception side for each connection without assistance.  If
        the reception side finds out, that the data have been received,
        which cannot be placed in the window, the connection is broken
        off.

   (2)  For transactions and fragmented instructions, which size exceeds
        the window, it is necessary to request the reception node the
        sanctions to sending.  The theoretical limiting size of chain
        transmitting so is 4 Gbytes.

   REQ_BUF.  The instruction "To request the buffer" requests at VM the
   buffer allocation for sending of transaction or large fragmented
   instruction ("Window").  It has the following values of fields:

      OPCODE = 24
      ASK = 1
      PCK = b01/11
      CHN = 0
      EXT = 0/1
      OPR_LENGTH = 1
      Operands:
         4 octets: The buffer required size in octets.  The value is
                   equal to the total size of all instructions of the
                   chain, including the size of the subordinated chains.

   The instruction is formed under the initiative of the protocol and it
   uses the instruction RSP_P as acknowledgement.  However, on the
   reception side the buffer is allocated at VM level, as VM has the
   most complete information about the task.  The interface between UMSP
   and VM must give possibility of asynchronous request of such buffer.

   The instruction REQ_BUF can be used irrespective of the possibility
   to place the chain in the buffer, allocated for session (window).  It
   is necessary to take into account, that the negative acknowledgement
   can be transmitted on this instruction, but using of a "window"
   guarantees sending.

   The subordinated chain on reception uses the buffer of the parental
   chain.

   The sequence sending will not require about the buffer allocation in
   difference of transaction or fragmented instruction.  If the single
   connection TCP is used for sending, the sequence buffering is not
   necessary.  If the multiple connections TCP with multiplexing are
   used, the sequence requires buffering for the disorder instructions.
   In this case, it is necessary to use the buffer, allocated for
   session.

   Transactions, at which flag TRR = 0, always must request the sanction
   for sending by instruction REQ_BUF, even if they can be placed in one
   segment of transport layer.

   The buffering of the fragmented instructions and transactions, at
   which flag TRR = 1, depends on their size:

   o  If the transaction is located in one segment of transport layer,
      it is transmitted without buffering.
   o  If length of a chain is no more then "window", it can be
      transmitted without request of the buffer of window allocation.
      Thus, the place in the buffer must be reserved before the sending
      begins.  The sending cannot be begun, if it is not enough places
      in the buffer.  In this case, it is possible to wait the window
      deallocation or to use the request instruction of the buffer
      allocation at VM REQ_BUF.
   o  If length exceeds the session window size it is necessary to use
      the instruction REQ_BUF.

   The field REQ_ID in chains of any type is established only in the
   first instruction and concerns to all chain.  The all following
   instructions, including last, do not contain REQ_ID.

   The transport protocol used for chains sending, must inform about the
   end of data transfer, because it is necessary for the transmitting
   side to know the free size of the allocated session window on the
   reception side.

   If the chain uses the allocated VM buffer (the sanction to sending
   REQ_BUF was requested), or the chain completely locates in transport
   layer segment, the protocol on the transmitting side does not trace
   acknowledgement.

   If the sequence is transmitted, the transmitting side receives the
   information about free place of the buffer on the reception side by
   acknowledgement of transport layer delivery.  It can be made, as the
   regulated sequence instructions are transmitted VM at once after
   receiving and release the buffer.

   The fragmented instructions and transactions are not transmitted VM
   until its will be completely accepted.  If session window is use, the
   occupation of places in the buffer can be calculated upon
   acknowledgement of transport layer sending.  To trace free of places
   it is necessary to check execution acknowledgement by VM.  The
   following algorithm of sending is used for this purpose:

   o  The value of field REQ_ID, which has given VM for chain sending,
      is kept and it is enters the value established by the protocol
      instead of it
   o  The new value REQ_ID is transmitted in the first instruction of
      chain
   o  The chain completely collected in the session window on the
      reception side.  After linking, it is transmitted for execution on
      VM.  At that, the chain can continue to occupy a place in the
      buffer.
   o  After execution, VM informs about it to the reception side
      protocol.
   o  The protocol clears place in the allocated buffer.
   o  Then the protocol forms and transmits on chain acknowledgement
      RSP_P, instead of RSP, as in other cases.
   o  The transmitting side protocol corrects size of free place in the
      reception side buffer after reception of acknowledgement RSP_P.
   o  Then the old value REQ_ID is restored and the acknowledgement is
      transmitted to VM.

   The instruction lifetime is calculated as follows:

   o  On the transmitting side the time of waiting in a queue to the
      transport layer is taken into account.  The value of the lifetime
      decreases on the waiting time value now of the transport layer
      package formation.
   o  On the reception side the lifetime is taken into account only for
      the fragmented instructions.  The value of the lifetime decreases
      on time of the instruction assembly value.  This header is ignored
      at receiving for no-fragmented instructions.  Its value must be
      sent to VM.
   o  The time of sending at the transport layer is not taken into
      account.  For the fragmented instructions, only the time of
      sending of the first fragment is not taken into account.

   The end of lifetime at the instruction relating to sequence finishes
   the sequence sending.  The header _LIFE_TIME must not be used at
   transactions sending.

   If the instruction is fragmented, the header _LIFE_TIME is sent only
   in the instruction NOP, containing the first fragment.  This header
   deletes from the initial fragmented instruction.  If the time is
   over, when the fragmented instruction part has not been transmitted
   yet, the stayed part of the instruction is cleared.

   The instruction lifetime is established by the sender VM and must be
   sent together with data to the addressee VM.  If the time of life
   expires, the instruction is rejected and the negative response (if
   ASK = 1) is sent to it.  If ASK = 0, the response is not sent.

   The header _LIFE_TIME may be used in the multimedia systems and in
   the real time systems.  The protocol may raise the priority of
   sending for data with coming to the end lifetime.

     49152 - 65534  Free (defined for dynamic and/or private VM)

   Numbers of types and versions %x0000 and %xFFFF are reserved by the
   protocol.

   Several VM of different types may be united in a group.  All VM,
   included in a group, must work in the common space of local memory
   and have the common subsystem of the jobs control.  It means, that if
   the same 128-bit address is met in anyone VM code for one task, it
   must specify one physical cell of memory.  The performance of the
   specified conditions allows executing multivendor user code
   (containing procedures for different VM) on one node.  All VM,
   included in a group, must have the different types.  The group can
   include no more than 65534 VM.  One number of group on different
   nodes may identify groups with different structure VM.

   To each group VM on the node the code of group of 2 octets length is
   assigned.  So long as the node has even one session connection, the
   codes of groups must not change.  It is recommended to change the
   code of group only at reconfiguration of the node.  The group VM is
   identified, as well as one VM.  Thus, the type VM is set to 0, and
   the number of group is assigned to VM version.

   The support of association VM in groups is optional requirement of
   the protocol.  The multivendor user code can be executed, even if the
   association in groups is not provided.  For this purpose, the
   procedures containing a different type of a code must be executed on
   different nodes.

   UMSP gives the instructions of search of the VM, which allow
   defining, what VM and the groups VM are connected at the given moment
   to the protocol on the definite node.

   The instructions of search of the VM can be sent upon TCP or UDP.
   The broadcasting dispatch can be used.  The node can independently
   notify about VM, available on it, for example at start, or to respond
   on others VM requests.  The answerback instructions must be sent
   under the same protocol, on which the request was received.

   The instruction "To request the VM" (VM_REQ) allows finding out VM,
   connected on the remote node.  The instruction has the following
   values of fields:

      OPCODE = 25
      PCK = %b00

                 group.

   The instruction without operands is used for request of all types VM,
   connected on the node.  The instruction with one VM in operands
   requests the information on one VM.  If it is contained several VM in
   operands, the group VM containing all specified VM is requested.  The
   type and version in list VM must be indexed on increase.

   To request VM, used at work without session connection, the VM type
   and VM version must have the value %xFFFF.

   The header _NAME is not connected with value of operands.  For it,
   the separate answer must be transmitted.

   It is necessary to generate several instructions, if it is required
   to inform about several VM or groups.  It is necessary to form the
   separate instructions for each protocol, if the node provides several
   transport protocols.

   If the instruction is used for the response to VM_REQ request, it can
   contain ASK = 1 and REQ_ID, established in value from the instruction
   of request.  If the VM group was requested, the instruction must
   contain several VM.  First VM must have the type set to 0 and the
   version must contain the number of group.  Others VM must define
   structure of group.  The type and version in VM list must be indexed
   on increase.

   The protocols, contained in the instruction VM_NOTIF, may differ from
   the protocol, through which this instruction is transferred.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" name="section-10">10</a> Security Considerations</span>

   The present document contains the description of the functions,
   minimally necessary for the realization of the declared task -
   immediate access to memory of the remote node.  To reduce initial
   complexity of the protocol, the decision of safety questions is not
   included in the document.  All reasons of the given unit are the
   recommendations to the further expansion of the protocol.

   For the description three nodes are used - node A and node B are
   exchanges the data.  The node G is JCP.

   Protection against sniffing, spoofing and hijacking:

      (1) The means specifies in TCP/IP can be used.
      (2) There is a possibility to create chains with the special
          processing.  To create such chain, it is necessary to transfer
          the extension header, determining the special processing, in
          the first instruction of the chain.  The instructions of chain
          can be encapsulated in the NOP instructions.  The algorithms
          of the control of instructions sequence integrity or the
          encryption can be realized in such a way.

   Protection against the man-in-the-middle:

      The protection is based on the fact, that the routes between nodes
      A - B, A - G and G - B is not crossed.  Such scheme allows
      organizing the additional managing dataflow, allowing revealing
      such type of attack.  If the specified routes pass through one
      gateway, this protection is less effective.

   Authentication:

      The protocol working is based on a principle of the centralized
      control.  It allows using several schemes of authentication.  The
      parameters of authentication are sent in the extension headers.
      The establishment of session connection can contain up to eight
      handshakes.  It also raises flexibility at a choice of
      authentication algorithm.  The realization of authentication is
      possible between three pairs nodes A - B, A - G and G - B.  All
      pairs can be used in any combination.  The node G can be specially
      allocated for realization of authentication.

   Protection against denial-of-service:

      The instructions of the protocol have definite computing loading.
      It allows projecting the node so, that it can process the
      instructions with such speed, with what they are accepted from the
      network.  A possible reason of an overload is the instructions
      JUMP and CALL.  VM must solve this problem.  It has the complete
      information about the user task and can make a decision on the
      amount of allocated resources.  The decision of a problem is the
      failure in service for low-priority traffic.

   Protection at the applications architecture level:

      The protocol allows creating the applications of any architecture.
      It is possible due to an asymmetric structure of connection.  It
      is possible to allocate three basic groups:

      (1) The client who is carrying out terminal functions and
          client/server technologies.  The security of such systems is
          completely defined by the server.  Such architecture is
          represented most protected.
      (2) The client, loading an active code from the server.  It is the
          least protected architecture, from the client point of view.
          On the server side, there are no special requirements upon
          protection.
      (3) The client, who is executing his code on the server.  This
          architecture is safe for the client.  It is necessary to
          strengthen the protection on the server.  The functionalities
          of such architecture do not differ from architecture of
          loading by the client of an active code.  If ones take into
          account, that the server is the specially allocated computer,
          the given architecture is optimum.

          All given technologies may be used simultaneously in any
          combination.
