The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network
Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload as well as
fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets. Furthermore, it
supports transmission of an HEVC bitstream over a single stream as
well as multiple RTP streams. When multiple RTP streams are used, a
single transport or multiple transports may be utilized. The payload
format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video
streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among others." name="DC.Description.Abstract"/>

       <span class="h1">RTP Payload Format for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)</span>

Abstract

   This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding
   standard ITU-T Recommendation H.265 and ISO/IEC International
   Standard 23008-2, both also known as High Efficiency Video Coding
   (HEVC) and developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding
   (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or
   more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload
   as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.
   Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC bitstream over a
   single stream as well as multiple RTP streams.  When multiple RTP
   streams are used, a single transport or multiple transports may be
   utilized.  The payload format has wide applicability in
   videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate
   entertainment-quality video, among others.

   The High Efficiency Video Coding specification, formally published as
   both ITU-T Recommendation H.265 [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] and ISO/IEC International
   Standard 23008-2 [<a href="#ref-ISO23008-2">ISO23008-2</a>], was ratified by the ITU-T in April
   2013; reportedly, it provides significant coding efficiency gains
   over H.264 [<a href="#ref-H.264" title='"Advanced video coding for generic audiovisual services"'>H.264</a>].

   This memo describes an RTP payload format for HEVC.  It shares its
   basic design with the RTP payload formats of [<a href="rfc6184.html" title='"RTP Payload Format for H.264 Video"'>RFC6184</a>] and [<a href="rfc6190.html" title='"RTP Payload Format for Scalable Video Coding"'>RFC6190</a>].
   With respect to design philosophy, security, congestion control, and
   overall implementation complexity, it has similar properties to those
   earlier payload format specifications.  This is a conscious choice,
   as at least <a href="rfc6184.html">RFC 6184</a> is widely deployed and generally known in the
   relevant implementer communities.  Mechanisms from <a href="rfc6190.html">RFC 6190</a> were
   incorporated as HEVC version 1 supports temporal scalability.

   In order to help the overlapping implementer community, frequently
   only the differences between RFCs 6184 and 6190 and the HEVC payload
   format are highlighted in non-normative, explanatory parts of this
   memo.  Basic familiarity with both specifications is assumed for
   those parts.  However, the normative parts of this memo do not
   require study of RFCs 6184 or 6190.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Overview%20of%20the%20HEVC%20Codec"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Overview of the HEVC Codec</span>

   H.264 and HEVC share a similar hybrid video codec design.  In this
   memo, we provide a very brief overview of those features of HEVC that
   are, in some form, addressed by the payload format specified herein.
   Implementers have to read, understand, and apply the ITU-T/ISO/IEC
   specifications pertaining to HEVC to arrive at interoperable, well-
   performing implementations.  Implementers should consider testing
   their design (including the interworking between the payload format
   implementation and the core video codec) using the tools provided by
   ITU-T/ISO/IEC, for example, conformance bitstreams as specified in
   [<a href="#ref-H.265.1" title='"Conformance specification for ITU-T H.265 high efficiency video coding"'>H.265.1</a>].  Not doing so has historically led to systems that perform
   badly and that are not secure.

   Conceptually, both H.264 and HEVC include a Video Coding Layer (VCL),
   which is often used to refer to the coding-tool features, and a
   Network Abstraction Layer (NAL), which is often used to refer to the
   systems and transport interface aspects of the codecs.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.1.%20%20Coding-Tool%20Features"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1.1" name="section-1.1.1">1.1.1</a>.  Coding-Tool Features</span>

   Similar to earlier hybrid-video-coding-based standards, including
   H.264, the following basic video coding design is employed by HEVC.
   A prediction signal is first formed by either intra- or motion-
   compensated prediction, and the residual (the difference between the
   original and the prediction) is then coded.  The gains in coding
   efficiency are achieved by redesigning and improving almost all parts
   of the codec over earlier designs.  In addition, HEVC includes
   several tools to make the implementation on parallel architectures
   easier.  Below is a summary of HEVC coding-tool features.

   Quad-tree block and transform structure

   One of the major tools that contributes significantly to the coding
   efficiency of HEVC is the use of flexible coding blocks and
   transforms, which are defined in a hierarchical quad-tree manner.
   Unlike H.264, where the basic coding block is a macroblock of fixed-
   size 16x16, HEVC defines a Coding Tree Unit (CTU) of a maximum size
   of 64x64.  Each CTU can be divided into smaller units in a
   hierarchical quad-tree manner and can represent smaller blocks down
   to size 4x4.  Similarly, the transforms used in HEVC can have
   different sizes, starting from 4x4 and going up to 32x32.  Utilizing
   large blocks and transforms contributes to the major gain of HEVC,
   especially at high resolutions.

   Entropy coding

   HEVC uses a single entropy-coding engine, which is based on Context
   Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (CABAC) [<a href="#ref-CABAC" title='"Transform coefficient coding in HEVC"'>CABAC</a>], whereas H.264 uses
   two distinct entropy coding engines.  CABAC in HEVC shares many
   similarities with CABAC of H.264, but contains several improvements.
   Those include improvements in coding efficiency and lowered
   implementation complexity, especially for parallel architectures.

   In-loop filtering

   H.264 includes an in-loop adaptive deblocking filter, where the
   blocking artifacts around the transform edges in the reconstructed
   picture are smoothed to improve the picture quality and compression
   efficiency.  In HEVC, a similar deblocking filter is employed but
   with somewhat lower complexity.  In addition, pictures undergo a
   subsequent filtering operation called Sample Adaptive Offset (SAO),
   which is a new design element in HEVC.  SAO basically adds a pixel-
   level offset in an adaptive manner and usually acts as a de-ringing
   filter.  It is observed that SAO improves the picture quality,
   especially around sharp edges, contributing substantially to visual
   quality improvements of HEVC.

   Motion prediction and coding

   There have been a number of improvements in this area that are
   summarized as follows.  The first category is motion merge and
   Advanced Motion Vector Prediction (AMVP) modes.  The motion
   information of a prediction block can be inferred from the spatially
   or temporally neighboring blocks.  This is similar to the DIRECT mode
   in H.264 but includes new aspects to incorporate the flexible quad-
   tree structure and methods to improve the parallel implementations.
   In addition, the motion vector predictor can be signaled for improved
   efficiency.  The second category is high-precision interpolation.
   The interpolation filter length is increased to 8-tap from 6-tap,
   which improves the coding efficiency but also comes with increased
   complexity.  In addition, the interpolation filter is defined with
   higher precision without any intermediate rounding operations to
   further improve the coding efficiency.

   Intra prediction and intra-coding

   Compared to 8 intra prediction modes in H.264, HEVC supports angular
   intra prediction with 33 directions.  This increased flexibility
   improves both objective coding efficiency and visual quality as the
   edges can be better predicted and ringing artifacts around the edges
   can be reduced.  In addition, the reference samples are adaptively
   smoothed based on the prediction direction.  To avoid contouring



<span class="grey">Wang, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 5]</span></pre>

   artifacts a new interpolative prediction generation is included to
   improve the visual quality.  Furthermore, Discrete Sine Transform
   (DST) is utilized instead of traditional Discrete Cosine Transform
   (DCT) for 4x4 intra-transform blocks.

   Other coding-tool features

   HEVC includes some tools for lossless coding and efficient screen-
   content coding, such as skipping the transform for certain blocks.
   These tools are particularly useful, for example, when streaming the
   user interface of a mobile device to a large display.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.2.%20%20Systems%20and%20Transport%20Interfaces"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1.2" name="section-1.1.2">1.1.2</a>.  Systems and Transport Interfaces</span>

   HEVC inherited the basic systems and transport interfaces designs
   from H.264.  These include the NAL-unit-based syntax structure, the
   hierarchical syntax and data unit structure, the Supplemental
   Enhancement Information (SEI) message mechanism, and the video
   buffering model based on the Hypothetical Reference Decoder (HRD).
   The hierarchical syntax and data unit structure consists of sequence-
   level parameter sets, multi-picture-level or picture-level parameter
   sets, slice-level header parameters, and lower-level parameters.  In
   the following, a list of differences in these aspects compared to
   H.264 is summarized.

   Video parameter set

   A new type of parameter set, called Video Parameter Set (VPS), was
   introduced.  For the first (2013) version of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>], the VPS NAL unit
   is required to be available prior to its activation, while the
   information contained in the VPS is not necessary for operation of
   the decoding process.  For future HEVC extensions, such as the 3D or
   scalable extensions, the VPS is expected to include information
   necessary for operation of the decoding process, e.g., decoding
   dependency or information for reference picture set construction of
   enhancement layers.  The VPS provides a "big picture" of a bitstream,
   including what types of operation points are provided, the profile,
   tier, and level of the operation points, and some other high-level
   properties of the bitstream that can be used as the basis for session
   negotiation and content selection, etc. (see <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>).

   Profile, tier, and level

   The profile, tier, and level syntax structure that can be included in
   both the VPS and Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) includes 12 bytes of
   data to describe the entire bitstream (including all temporally
   scalable layers, which are referred to as sub-layers in the HEVC
   specification), and can optionally include more profile, tier, and



<span class="grey">Wang, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 6]</span></pre>

   level information pertaining to individual temporally scalable
   layers.  The profile indicator shows the "best viewed as" profile
   when the bitstream conforms to multiple profiles, similar to the
   major brand concept in the ISO Base Media File Format (ISOBMFF)
   [<a href="#ref-IS014496-12">IS014496-12</a>] [<a href="#ref-IS015444-12">IS015444-12</a>] and file formats derived based on
   ISOBMFF, such as the 3GPP file format [<a href="#ref-3GPPFF" title='"Transparent end-to-end packet switched streaming service (PSS); 3GPP file format (3GP)"'>3GPPFF</a>].  The profile, tier,
   and level syntax structure also includes indications such as 1)
   whether the bitstream is free of frame-packed content, 2) whether the
   bitstream is free of interlaced source content, and 3) whether the
   bitstream is free of field pictures.  When the answer is yes for both
   2) and 3), the bitstream contains only frame pictures of progressive
   source.  Based on these indications, clients/players without support
   of post-processing functionalities for the handling of frame-packed,
   interlaced source content or field pictures can reject those
   bitstreams that contain such pictures.

   Bitstream and elementary stream

   HEVC includes a definition of an elementary stream, which is new
   compared to H.264.  An elementary stream consists of a sequence of
   one or more bitstreams.  An elementary stream that consists of two or
   more bitstreams has typically been formed by splicing together two or
   more bitstreams (or parts thereof).  When an elementary stream
   contains more than one bitstream, the last NAL unit of the last
   access unit of a bitstream (except the last bitstream in the
   elementary stream) must contain an end of bitstream NAL unit, and the
   first access unit of the subsequent bitstream must be an Intra-Random
   Access Point (IRAP) access unit.  This IRAP access unit may be a
   Clean Random Access (CRA), Broken Link Access (BLA), or Instantaneous
   Decoding Refresh (IDR) access unit.

   Random access support

   HEVC includes signaling in the NAL unit header, through NAL unit
   types, of IRAP pictures beyond IDR pictures.  Three types of IRAP
   pictures, namely IDR, CRA, and BLA pictures, are supported: IDR
   pictures are conventionally referred to as closed group-of-pictures
   (closed-GOP) random access points whereas CRA and BLA pictures are
   conventionally referred to as open-GOP random access points.  BLA
   pictures usually originate from splicing of two bitstreams or part
   thereof at a CRA picture, e.g., during stream switching.  To enable
   better systems usage of IRAP pictures, altogether six different NAL
   units are defined to signal the properties of the IRAP pictures,
   which can be used to better match the stream access point types as
   defined in the ISOBMFF [<a href="#ref-IS014496-12">IS014496-12</a>] [<a href="#ref-IS015444-12">IS015444-12</a>], which are
   utilized for random access support in both 3GP-DASH [<a href="#ref-3GPDASH" title='"Transparent end-to-end Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS); Progressive Download and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (3GP-DASH)"'>3GPDASH</a>] and
   MPEG DASH [<a href="#ref-MPEGDASH" title='"Information technology - Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) -- Part 1: Media presentation description and segment formats"'>MPEGDASH</a>].  Pictures following an IRAP picture in decoding
   order and preceding the IRAP picture in output order are referred to



<span class="grey">Wang, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-8" id="page-8" name="page-8"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7798.html">RFC 7798</a>               RTP Payload Format for HEVC            March 2016</span>


   as leading pictures associated with the IRAP picture.  There are two
   types of leading pictures: Random Access Decodable Leading (RADL)
   pictures and Random Access Skipped Leading (RASL) pictures.  RADL
   pictures are decodable when the decoding started at the associated
   IRAP picture; RASL pictures are not decodable when the decoding
   started at the associated IRAP picture and are usually discarded.
   HEVC provides mechanisms to enable specifying the conformance of a
   bitstream wherein the originally present RASL pictures have been
   discarded.  Consequently, system components can discard RASL
   pictures, when needed, without worrying about causing the bitstream
   to become non-compliant.

   Temporal scalability support

   HEVC includes an improved support of temporal scalability, by
   inclusion of the signaling of TemporalId in the NAL unit header, the
   restriction that pictures of a particular temporal sub-layer cannot
   be used for inter prediction reference by pictures of a lower
   temporal sub-layer, the sub-bitstream extraction process, and the
   requirement that each sub-bitstream extraction output be a conforming
   bitstream.  Media-Aware Network Elements (MANEs) can utilize the
   TemporalId in the NAL unit header for stream adaptation purposes
   based on temporal scalability.

   Temporal sub-layer switching support

   HEVC specifies, through NAL unit types present in the NAL unit
   header, the signaling of Temporal Sub-layer Access (TSA) and Step-
   wise Temporal Sub-layer Access (STSA).  A TSA picture and pictures
   following the TSA picture in decoding order do not use pictures prior
   to the TSA picture in decoding order with TemporalId greater than or
   equal to that of the TSA picture for inter prediction reference.  A
   TSA picture enables up-switching, at the TSA picture, to the sub-
   layer containing the TSA picture or any higher sub-layer, from the
   immediately lower sub-layer.  An STSA picture does not use pictures
   with the same TemporalId as the STSA picture for inter prediction
   reference.  Pictures following an STSA picture in decoding order with
   the same TemporalId as the STSA picture do not use pictures prior to
   the STSA picture in decoding order with the same TemporalId as the
   STSA picture for inter prediction reference.  An STSA picture enables
   up-switching, at the STSA picture, to the sub-layer containing the
   STSA picture, from the immediately lower sub-layer.

   Sub-layer reference or non-reference pictures

   The concept and signaling of reference/non-reference pictures in HEVC
   are different from H.264.  In H.264, if a picture may be used by any
   other picture for inter prediction reference, it is a reference



<span class="grey">Wang, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 8]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-9" id="page-9" name="page-9"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7798.html">RFC 7798</a>               RTP Payload Format for HEVC            March 2016</span>


   picture; otherwise, it is a non-reference picture, and this is
   signaled by two bits in the NAL unit header.  In HEVC, a picture is
   called a reference picture only when it is marked as "used for
   reference".  In addition, the concept of sub-layer reference picture
   was introduced.  If a picture may be used by another other picture
   with the same TemporalId for inter prediction reference, it is a sub-
   layer reference picture; otherwise, it is a sub-layer non-reference
   picture.  Whether a picture is a sub-layer reference picture or sub-
   layer non-reference picture is signaled through NAL unit type values.

   Extensibility

   Besides the TemporalId in the NAL unit header, HEVC also includes the
   signaling of a six-bit layer ID in the NAL unit header, which must be
   equal to 0 for a single-layer bitstream.  Extension mechanisms have
   been included in the VPS, SPS, Picture Parameter Set (PPS), SEI NAL
   unit, slice headers, and so on.  All these extension mechanisms
   enable future extensions in a backward-compatible manner, such that
   bitstreams encoded according to potential future HEVC extensions can
   be fed to then-legacy decoders (e.g., HEVC version 1 decoders), and
   the then-legacy decoders can decode and output the base-layer
   bitstream.

   Bitstream extraction

   HEVC includes a bitstream-extraction process as an integral part of
   the overall decoding process.  The bitstream extraction process is
   used in the process of bitstream conformance tests, which is part of
   the HRD buffering model.

   Reference picture management

   The reference picture management of HEVC, including reference picture
   marking and removal from the Decoded Picture Buffer (DPB) as well as
   Reference Picture List Construction (RPLC), differs from that of
   H.264.  Instead of the reference picture marking mechanism based on a
   sliding window plus adaptive Memory Management Control Operation
   (MMCO) described in H.264, HEVC specifies a reference picture
   management and marking mechanism based on Reference Picture Set
   (RPS), and the RPLC is consequently based on the RPS mechanism.  An
   RPS consists of a set of reference pictures associated with a
   picture, consisting of all reference pictures that are prior to the
   associated picture in decoding order, that may be used for inter
   prediction of the associated picture or any picture following the
   associated picture in decoding order.  The reference picture set
   consists of five lists of reference pictures; RefPicSetStCurrBefore,
   RefPicSetStCurrAfter, RefPicSetStFoll, RefPicSetLtCurr, and
   RefPicSetLtFoll.  RefPicSetStCurrBefore, RefPicSetStCurrAfter, and



<span class="grey">Wang, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 9]</span></pre>

   RefPicSetLtCurr contain all reference pictures that may be used in
   inter prediction of the current picture and that may be used in inter
   prediction of one or more of the pictures following the current
   picture in decoding order.  RefPicSetStFoll and RefPicSetLtFoll
   consist of all reference pictures that are not used in inter
   prediction of the current picture but may be used in inter prediction
   of one or more of the pictures following the current picture in
   decoding order.  RPS provides an "intra-coded" signaling of the DPB
   status, instead of an "inter-coded" signaling, mainly for improved
   error resilience.  The RPLC process in HEVC is based on the RPS, by
   signaling an index to an RPS subset for each reference index; this
   process is simpler than the RPLC process in H.264.

   Ultra-low delay support

   HEVC specifies a sub-picture-level HRD operation, for support of the
   so-called ultra-low delay.  The mechanism specifies a standard-
   compliant way to enable delay reduction below a one-picture interval.
   Coded Picture Buffer (CPB) and DPB parameters at the sub-picture
   level may be signaled, and utilization of this information for the
   derivation of CPB timing (wherein the CPB removal time corresponds to
   decoding time) and DPB output timing (display time) is specified.
   Decoders are allowed to operate the HRD at the conventional access-
   unit level, even when the sub-picture-level HRD parameters are
   present.

   New SEI messages

   HEVC inherits many H.264 SEI messages with changes in syntax and/or
   semantics making them applicable to HEVC.  Additionally, there are a
   few new SEI messages reviewed briefly in the following paragraphs.

   The display orientation SEI message informs the decoder of a
   transformation that is recommended to be applied to the cropped
   decoded picture prior to display, such that the pictures can be
   properly displayed, e.g., in an upside-up manner.

   The structure of pictures SEI message provides information on the NAL
   unit types, picture-order count values, and prediction dependencies
   of a sequence of pictures.  The SEI message can be used, for example,
   for concluding what impact a lost picture has on other pictures.

   The decoded picture hash SEI message provides a checksum derived from
   the sample values of a decoded picture.  It can be used for detecting
   whether a picture was correctly received and decoded.






<span class="grey">Wang, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 10]</span></pre>

   The active parameter sets SEI message includes the IDs of the active
   video parameter set and the active sequence parameter set and can be
   used to activate VPSs and SPSs.  In addition, the SEI message
   includes the following indications: 1) An indication of whether "full
   random accessibility" is supported (when supported, all parameter
   sets needed for decoding of the remaining of the bitstream when
   random accessing from the beginning of the current CVS by completely
   discarding all access units earlier in decoding order are present in
   the remaining bitstream, and all coded pictures in the remaining
   bitstream can be correctly decoded); 2) An indication of whether
   there is no parameter set within the current CVS that updates another
   parameter set of the same type preceding in decoding order.  An
   update of a parameter set refers to the use of the same parameter set
   ID but with some other parameters changed.  If this property is true
   for all CVSs in the bitstream, then all parameter sets can be sent
   out-of-band before session start.

   The decoding unit information SEI message provides information
   regarding coded picture buffer removal delay for a decoding unit.
   The message can be used in very-low-delay buffering operations.

   The region refresh information SEI message can be used together with
   the recovery point SEI message (present in both H.264 and HEVC) for
   improved support of gradual decoding refresh.  This supports random
   access from inter-coded pictures, wherein complete pictures can be
   correctly decoded or recovered after an indicated number of pictures
   in output/display order.

   The reportedly significantly higher encoding computational demand of
   HEVC over H.264, in conjunction with the ever-increasing video
   resolution (both spatially and temporally) required by the market,
   led to the adoption of VCL coding tools specifically targeted to
   allow for parallelization on the sub-picture level.  That is,
   parallelization occurs, at the minimum, at the granularity of an
   integer number of CTUs.  The targets for this type of high-level
   parallelization are multicore CPUs and DSPs as well as multiprocessor
   systems.  In a system design, to be useful, these tools require
   signaling support, which is provided in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> of this memo.  This
   section provides a brief overview of the tools available in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>].

   Many of the tools incorporated in HEVC were designed keeping in mind
   the potential parallel implementations in multicore/multiprocessor
   architectures.  Specifically, for parallelization, four picture
   partition strategies, as described below, are available.

   Slices are segments of the bitstream that can be reconstructed
   independently from other slices within the same picture (though there
   may still be interdependencies through loop filtering operations).
   Slices are the only tool that can be used for parallelization that is
   also available, in virtually identical form, in H.264.
   Parallelization based on slices does not require much inter-processor
   or inter-core communication (except for inter-processor or inter-core
   data sharing for motion compensation when decoding a predictively
   coded picture, which is typically much heavier than inter-processor
   or inter-core data sharing due to in-picture prediction), as slices
   are designed to be independently decodable.  However, for the same
   reason, slices can require some coding overhead.  Further, slices (in
   contrast to some of the other tools mentioned below) also serve as
   the key mechanism for bitstream partitioning to match Maximum
   Transfer Unit (MTU) size requirements, due to the in-picture
   independence of slices and the fact that each regular slice is
   encapsulated in its own NAL unit.  In many cases, the goal of
   parallelization and the goal of MTU size matching can place
   contradicting demands to the slice layout in a picture.  The
   realization of this situation led to the development of the more
   advanced tools mentioned below.

   Dependent slice segments allow for fragmentation of a coded slice
   into fragments at CTU boundaries without breaking any in-picture
   prediction mechanisms.  They are complementary to the fragmentation
   mechanism described in this memo in that they need the cooperation of
   the encoder.  As a dependent slice segment necessarily contains an
   integer number of CTUs, a decoder using multiple cores operating on
   CTUs can process a dependent slice segment without communicating
   parts of the slice segment's bitstream to other cores.
   Fragmentation, as specified in this memo, in contrast, does not
   guarantee that a fragment contains an integer number of CTUs.

   In Wavefront Parallel Processing (WPP), the picture is partitioned
   into rows of CTUs.  Entropy decoding and prediction are allowed to
   use data from CTUs in other partitions.  Parallel processing is
   possible through parallel decoding of CTU rows, where the start of
   the decoding of a row is delayed by two CTUs, so to ensure that data
   related to a CTU above and to the right of the subject CTU is
   available before the subject CTU is being decoded.  Using this
   staggered start (which appears like a wavefront when represented
   graphically), parallelization is possible with up to as many
   processors/cores as the picture contains CTU rows.

   Because in-picture prediction between neighboring CTU rows within a
   picture is allowed, the required inter-processor/inter-core
   communication to enable in-picture prediction can be substantial.
   The WPP partitioning does not result in the creation of more NAL

   units compared to when it is not applied; thus, WPP cannot be used
   for MTU size matching, though slices can be used in combination for
   that purpose.

   Tiles define horizontal and vertical boundaries that partition a
   picture into tile columns and rows.  The scan order of CTUs is
   changed to be local within a tile (in the order of a CTU raster scan
   of a tile), before decoding the top-left CTU of the next tile in the
   order of tile raster scan of a picture.  Similar to slices, tiles
   break in-picture prediction dependencies (including entropy decoding
   dependencies).  However, they do not need to be included into
   individual NAL units (same as WPP in this regard); hence, tiles
   cannot be used for MTU size matching, though slices can be used in
   combination for that purpose.  Each tile can be processed by one
   processor/core, and the inter-processor/inter-core communication
   required for in-picture prediction between processing units decoding
   neighboring tiles is limited to conveying the shared slice header in
   cases a slice is spanning more than one tile, and loop-filtering-
   related sharing of reconstructed samples and metadata.  Insofar,
   tiles are less demanding in terms of inter-processor communication
   bandwidth compared to WPP due to the in-picture independence between
   two neighboring partitions.

   HEVC maintains the NAL unit concept of H.264 with modifications.
   HEVC uses a two-byte NAL unit header, as shown in Figure 1.  The
   payload of a NAL unit refers to the NAL unit excluding the NAL unit
   header.

      the value 1 may be used to indicate a syntax violation, e.g., for
      a NAL unit resulted from aggregating a number of fragmented units
      of a NAL unit but missing the last fragment, as described in

      of a NAL unit is equal to 0 (i.e., the value of this field is less
      than 32), the NAL unit is a VCL NAL unit.  Otherwise, the NAL unit
      is a non-VCL NAL unit.  For a reference of all currently defined
      NAL unit types and their semantics, please refer to Section 7.4.2
      in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>].

      anticipated that in future scalable or 3D video coding extensions
      of this specification, this syntax element will be used to
      identify additional layers that may be present in the CVS, wherein
      a layer may be, e.g., a spatial scalable layer, a quality scalable
      layer, a texture view, or a depth view.

      nuh_temporal_id_plus1.  This field specifies the temporal
      identifier of the NAL unit plus 1.  The value of TemporalId is

      there is at least one bit in the NAL unit header equal to 1, so to
      enable independent considerations of start code emulations in the

   dependee RTP stream: An RTP stream on which another RTP stream
   depends.  All RTP streams in a Multiple RTP streams on a Single media
   Transport (MRST) or Multiple RTP streams on Multiple media Transports
   (MRMT), except for the highest RTP stream, are dependee RTP streams.

   highest RTP stream: The RTP stream on which no other RTP stream
   depends.  The RTP stream in a Single RTP stream on a Single media
   Transport (SRST) is the highest RTP stream.

   Media-Aware Network Element (MANE): A network element, such as a
   middlebox, selective forwarding unit, or application-layer gateway
   that is capable of parsing certain aspects of the RTP payload headers
   or the RTP payload and reacting to their contents.

      Informative note: The concept of a MANE goes beyond normal routers
      or gateways in that a MANE has to be aware of the signaling (e.g.,
      to learn about the payload type mappings of the media streams),
      and in that it has to be trusted when working with Secure RTP
      (SRTP).  The advantage of using MANEs is that they allow packets
      to be dropped according to the needs of the media coding.  For
      example, if a MANE has to drop packets due to congestion on a
      certain link, it can identify and remove those packets whose
      elimination produces the least adverse effect on the user
      experience.  After dropping packets, MANEs must rewrite RTCP
      packets to match the changes to the RTP stream, as specified in
      <a href="rfc3550.html#section-7">Section 7 of [RFC3550]</a>.

   Media Transport: As used in the MRST, MRMT, and SRST definitions
   below, Media Transport denotes the transport of packets over a
   transport association identified by a 5-tuple (source address, source
   port, destination address, destination port, transport protocol).

   and in which NAL units within an access unit are in their decoding
   order.

   NAL-unit-like structure: A data structure that is similar to NAL
   units in the sense that it also has a NAL unit header and a payload,
   with a difference that the payload does not follow the start code
   emulation prevention mechanism required for the NAL unit syntax as
   specified in Section 7.3.1.1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>].  Examples of NAL-unit-like

   The RTP header information to be set according to this RTP payload
   format is set as follows:

   Marker bit (M): 1 bit

      Set for the last packet of the access unit, carried in the current
      RTP stream.  This is in line with the normal use of the M bit in
      video formats to allow an efficient playout buffer handling.  When
      MRST or MRMT is in use, if an access unit appears in multiple RTP
      streams, the marker bit is set on each RTP stream's last packet of
      the access unit.

         Informative note: The content of a NAL unit does not tell
         whether or not the NAL unit is the last NAL unit, in decoding
         order, of an access unit.  An RTP sender implementation may
         obtain this information from the video encoder.  If, however,
         the implementation cannot obtain this information directly from
         the encoder, e.g., when the bitstream was pre-encoded, and also
         there is no timestamp allocated for each NAL unit, then the
         sender implementation can inspect subsequent NAL units in
         decoding order to determine whether or not the NAL unit is the
         last NAL unit of an access unit as follows.  A NAL unit is
         determined to be the last NAL unit of an access unit if it is
         the last NAL unit of the bitstream.  A NAL unit naluX is also
         determined to be the last NAL unit of an access unit if both
         the following conditions are true: 1) the next VCL NAL unit
         naluY in decoding order has the high-order bit of the first
         byte after its NAL unit header equal to 1, and 2) all NAL units
         between naluX and naluY, when present, have nal_unit_type in
         the range of 32 to 35, inclusive, equal to 39, or in the ranges
         of 41 to 44, inclusive, or 48 to 55, inclusive.

   Payload Type (PT): 7 bits

      The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format
      is outside the scope of this document and will not be specified
      here.  The assignment of a payload type has to be performed either
      through the profile used or in a dynamic way.

         Informative note: It is not required to use different payload
         type values for different RTP streams in MRST or MRMT.

   Sequence Number (SN): 16 bits

      Set and used in accordance with [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].

   Timestamp: 32 bits

      The RTP timestamp is set to the sampling timestamp of the content.
      A 90 kHz clock rate MUST be used.

      If the NAL unit has no timing properties of its own (e.g.,
      parameter set and SEI NAL units), the RTP timestamp MUST be set to
      the RTP timestamp of the coded picture of the access unit in which
      the NAL unit (according to Section 7.4.2.4.4 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>]) is
      included.

      Receivers MUST use the RTP timestamp for the display process, even
      when the bitstream contains picture timing SEI messages or
      decoding unit information SEI messages as specified in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>].
      However, this does not mean that picture timing SEI messages in
      the bitstream should be discarded, as picture timing SEI messages
      may contain frame-field information that is important in
      appropriately rendering interlaced video.

   Synchronization source (SSRC): 32 bits

      Used to identify the source of the RTP packets.  When using SRST,
      by definition a single SSRC is used for all parts of a single
      bitstream.  In MRST or MRMT, different SSRCs are used for each RTP
      stream containing a subset of the sub-layers of the single
      (temporally scalable) bitstream.  A receiver is required to
      correctly associate the set of SSRCs that are included parts of
      the same bitstream.

   The first two bytes of the payload of an RTP packet are referred to
   as the payload header.  The payload header consists of the same
   fields (F, Type, LayerId, and TID) as the NAL unit header as shown in
   <a href="#section-1.1.4">Section 1.1.4</a>, irrespective of the type of the payload structure.

   The TID value indicates (among other things) the relative importance
   of an RTP packet, for example, because NAL units belonging to higher
   temporal sub-layers are not used for the decoding of lower temporal
   sub-layers.  A lower value of TID indicates a higher importance.
   More-important NAL units MAY be better protected against transmission
   losses than less-important NAL units.

   This memo enables transmission of an HEVC bitstream over:

      o a Single RTP stream on a Single media Transport (SRST),

      o Multiple RTP streams over a Single media Transport (MRST), or

      o Multiple RTP streams on Multiple media Transports (MRMT).

      Informative note: While this specification enables the use of MRST
      within the H.265 RTP payload, the signaling of MRST within SDP
      offer/answer is not fully specified at the time of this writing.
      See [<a href="rfc5576.html" title='"Source-Specific Media Attributes in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC5576</a>] and [<a href="rfc5583.html" title='"Signaling Media Decoding Dependency in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC5583</a>] for what is supported today as well as
      [<a href="#ref-RTP-MULTI-STREAM">RTP-MULTI-STREAM</a>] and [<a href="#ref-SDP-NEG" title='"Negotiating Medai Multiplexing Using Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>SDP-NEG</a>] for future directions.

   When in MRMT, the dependency of one RTP stream on another RTP stream
   is typically indicated as specified in [<a href="rfc5583.html" title='"Signaling Media Decoding Dependency in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC5583</a>].  [<a href="rfc5583.html" title='"Signaling Media Decoding Dependency in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC5583</a>] can also
   be utilized to specify dependencies within MRST, but only if the RTP
   streams utilize distinct payload types.

   SRST or MRST SHOULD be used for point-to-point unicast scenarios,
   whereas MRMT SHOULD be used for point-to-multipoint multicast
   scenarios where different receivers require different operation
   points of the same HEVC bitstream, to improve bandwidth utilizing
   efficiency.

      Informative note: A multicast may degrade to a unicast after all
      but one receivers have left (this is a justification of the first
      "SHOULD" instead of "MUST"), and there might be scenarios where
      MRMT is desirable but not possible, e.g., when IP multicast is not
      deployed in certain network (this is a justification of the second
      "SHOULD" instead of "MUST").

   The transmission mode is indicated by the tx-mode media parameter
   (see <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>).  If tx-mode is equal to "SRST", SRST MUST be used.
   Otherwise, if tx-mode is equal to "MRST", MRST MUST be used.
   Otherwise (tx-mode is equal to "MRMT"), MRMT MUST be used.

      Informative note: When an RTP stream does not depend on other RTP
      streams, any of SRST, MRST, or MRMT may be in use for the RTP
      stream.

   Receivers MUST support all of SRST, MRST, and MRMT.

      Informative note: The required support of MRMT by receivers does
      not imply that multicast must be supported by receivers.

   Four different types of RTP packet payload structures are specified.
   A receiver can identify the type of an RTP packet payload through the
   Type field in the payload header.

   The four different payload structures are as follows:

   o  Single NAL unit packet: Contains a single NAL unit in the payload,
      and the NAL unit header of the NAL unit also serves as the payload
      header.  This payload structure is specified in <a href="#section-4.4.1">Section 4.4.1</a>.

   o  Aggregation Packet (AP): Contains more than one NAL unit within
      one access unit.  This payload structure is specified in <a href="#section-4.4.2">Section</a>
      <a href="#section-4.4.2">4.4.2</a>.

   o  Fragmentation Unit (FU): Contains a subset of a single NAL unit.
      This payload structure is specified in <a href="#section-4.4.3">Section 4.4.3</a>.

   o  PACI carrying RTP packet: Contains a payload header (that differs
      from other payload headers for efficiency), a Payload Header
      Extension Structure (PHES), and a PACI payload.  This payload
      structure is specified in <a href="#section-4.4.4">Section 4.4.4</a>.

   A single NAL unit packet contains exactly one NAL unit, and consists
   of a payload header (denoted as PayloadHdr), a conditional 16-bit
   DONL field (in network byte order), and the NAL unit payload data
   (the NAL unit excluding its NAL unit header) of the contained NAL
   unit, as shown in Figure 3.

   The payload header SHOULD be an exact copy of the NAL unit header of
   the contained NAL unit.  However, the Type (i.e., nal_unit_type)
   field MAY be changed, e.g., when it is desirable to handle a CRA
   picture to be a BLA picture [<a href="#ref-JCTVC-J0107">JCTVC-J0107</a>].

   The DONL field, when present, specifies the value of the 16 least
   significant bits of the decoding order number of the contained NAL
   unit.  If sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any of the RTP
   streams, the DONL field MUST be present, and the variable DON for the
   contained NAL unit is derived as equal to the value of the DONL
   field.  Otherwise (sprop-max-don-diff is equal to 0 for all the RTP
   streams), the DONL field MUST NOT be present.

   Aggregation Packets (APs) are introduced to enable the reduction of
   packetization overhead for small NAL units, such as most of the non-
   VCL NAL units, which are often only a few octets in size.

   An AP aggregates NAL units within one access unit.  Each NAL unit to
   be carried in an AP is encapsulated in an aggregation unit.  NAL
   units aggregated in one AP are in NAL unit decoding order.

   An AP consists of a payload header (denoted as PayloadHdr) followed
   by two or more aggregation units, as shown in Figure 4.

   The fields in the payload header are set as follows.  The F bit MUST
   be equal to 0 if the F bit of each aggregated NAL unit is equal to
   zero; otherwise, it MUST be equal to 1.  The Type field MUST be equal
   to 48.  The value of LayerId MUST be equal to the lowest value of
   LayerId of all the aggregated NAL units.  The value of TID MUST be
   the lowest value of TID of all the aggregated NAL units.

      Informative note: All VCL NAL units in an AP have the same TID
      value since they belong to the same access unit.  However, an AP
      may contain non-VCL NAL units for which the TID value in the NAL
      unit header may be different than the TID value of the VCL NAL
      units in the same AP.

   An AP MUST carry at least two aggregation units and can carry as many
   aggregation units as necessary; however, the total amount of data in
   an AP obviously MUST fit into an IP packet, and the size SHOULD be
   chosen so that the resulting IP packet is smaller than the MTU size
   so to avoid IP layer fragmentation.  An AP MUST NOT contain FUs
   specified in <a href="#section-4.4.3">Section 4.4.3</a>.  APs MUST NOT be nested; i.e., an AP must
   not contain another AP.

   The first aggregation unit in an AP consists of a conditional 16-bit
   DONL field (in network byte order) followed by a 16-bit unsigned size
   information (in network byte order) that indicates the size of the
   NAL unit in bytes (excluding these two octets, but including the NAL
   unit header), followed by the NAL unit itself, including its NAL unit
   header, as shown in Figure 5.

   significant bits of the decoding order number of the aggregated NAL
   unit.

   If sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any of the RTP streams,
   the DONL field MUST be present in an aggregation unit that is the
   first aggregation unit in an AP, and the variable DON for the
   aggregated NAL unit is derived as equal to the value of the DONL
   field.  Otherwise (sprop-max-don-diff is equal to 0 for all the RTP
   streams), the DONL field MUST NOT be present in an aggregation unit
   that is the first aggregation unit in an AP.

   An aggregation unit that is not the first aggregation unit in an AP
   consists of a conditional 8-bit DOND field followed by a 16-bit
   unsigned size information (in network byte order) that indicates the
   size of the NAL unit in bytes (excluding these two octets, but
   including the NAL unit header), followed by the NAL unit itself,
   including its NAL unit header, as shown in Figure 6.

   First Aggregation Unit in an AP

   When present, the DOND field plus 1 specifies the difference between
   the decoding order number values of the current aggregated NAL unit
   and the preceding aggregated NAL unit in the same AP.

   If sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any of the RTP streams,
   the DOND field MUST be present in an aggregation unit that is not the
   first aggregation unit in an AP, and the variable DON for the
   aggregated NAL unit is derived as equal to the DON of the preceding
   aggregated NAL unit in the same AP plus the value of the DOND field
   plus 1 modulo 65536.  Otherwise (sprop-max-don-diff is equal to 0 for
   all the RTP streams), the DOND field MUST NOT be present in an
   aggregation unit that is not the first aggregation unit in an AP, and
   in this case the transmission order and decoding order of NAL units
   carried in the AP are the same as the order the NAL units appear in
   the AP.

   Figure 7 presents an example of an AP that contains two aggregation
   units, labeled as 1 and 2 in the figure, without the DONL and DOND
   fields being present.

   Fragmentation Units (FUs) are introduced to enable fragmenting a
   single NAL unit into multiple RTP packets, possibly without
   cooperation or knowledge of the HEVC encoder.  A fragment of a NAL
   unit consists of an integer number of consecutive octets of that NAL
   unit.  Fragments of the same NAL unit MUST be sent in consecutive
   order with ascending RTP sequence numbers (with no other RTP packets
   within the same RTP stream being sent between the first and last
   fragment).

   When a NAL unit is fragmented and conveyed within FUs, it is referred
   to as a fragmented NAL unit.  APs MUST NOT be fragmented.  FUs MUST
   NOT be nested; i.e., an FU must not contain a subset of another FU.

   The RTP timestamp of an RTP packet carrying an FU is set to the NALU-
   time of the fragmented NAL unit.

   An FU consists of a payload header (denoted as PayloadHdr), an FU
   header of one octet, a conditional 16-bit DONL field (in network byte
   order), and an FU payload, as shown in Figure 9.

   The fields in the payload header are set as follows.  The Type field
   MUST be equal to 49.  The fields F, LayerId, and TID MUST be equal to
   the fields F, LayerId, and TID, respectively, of the fragmented NAL
   unit.

   The FU header consists of an S bit, an E bit, and a 6-bit FuType
   field, as shown in Figure 10.

   Figure 10: The Structure of FU Header

   The semantics of the FU header fields are as follows:

   S: 1 bit
      When set to 1, the S bit indicates the start of a fragmented NAL
      unit, i.e., the first byte of the FU payload is also the first
      byte of the payload of the fragmented NAL unit.  When the FU
      payload is not the start of the fragmented NAL unit payload, the S
      bit MUST be set to 0.

   E: 1 bit
      When set to 1, the E bit indicates the end of a fragmented NAL
      unit, i.e., the last byte of the payload is also the last byte of
      the fragmented NAL unit.  When the FU payload is not the last
      fragment of a fragmented NAL unit, the E bit MUST be set to 0.

   FuType: 6 bits
      The field FuType MUST be equal to the field Type of the fragmented
      NAL unit.

   The DONL field, when present, specifies the value of the 16 least
   significant bits of the decoding order number of the fragmented NAL
   unit.

   If sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any of the RTP streams,
   and the S bit is equal to 1, the DONL field MUST be present in the
   FU, and the variable DON for the fragmented NAL unit is derived as
   equal to the value of the DONL field.  Otherwise (sprop-max-don-diff
   is equal to 0 for all the RTP streams, or the S bit is equal to 0),
   the DONL field MUST NOT be present in the FU.

   A non-fragmented NAL unit MUST NOT be transmitted in one FU; i.e.,
   the Start bit and End bit must not both be set to 1 in the same FU
   header.

   The FU payload consists of fragments of the payload of the fragmented
   NAL unit so that if the FU payloads of consecutive FUs, starting with
   an FU with the S bit equal to 1 and ending with an FU with the E bit
   equal to 1, are sequentially concatenated, the payload of the
   fragmented NAL unit can be reconstructed.  The NAL unit header of the
   fragmented NAL unit is not included as such in the FU payload, but
   rather the information of the NAL unit header of the fragmented NAL
   unit is conveyed in F, LayerId, and TID fields of the FU payload
   headers of the FUs and the FuType field of the FU header of the FUs.
   An FU payload MUST NOT be empty.

   If an FU is lost, the receiver SHOULD discard all following
   fragmentation units in transmission order corresponding to the same
   fragmented NAL unit, unless the decoder in the receiver is known to
   be prepared to gracefully handle incomplete NAL units.

   A receiver in an endpoint or in a MANE MAY aggregate the first n-1
   fragments of a NAL unit to an (incomplete) NAL unit, even if fragment
   n of that NAL unit is not received.  In this case, the
   forbidden_zero_bit of the NAL unit MUST be set to 1 to indicate a
   syntax violation.

   This section specifies the PACI packet structure.  The basic payload
   header specified in this memo is intentionally limited to the 16 bits
   of the NAL unit header so to keep the packetization overhead to a
   minimum.  However, cases have been identified where it is advisable
   to include control information in an easily accessible position in
   the packet header, despite the additional overhead.  One such control
   information is the TSCI as specified in <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>.  PACI packets
   carry this and future, similar structures.

   The PACI packet structure is based on a payload header extension
   mechanism that is generic and extensible to carry payload header
   extensions.  In this section, the focus lies on the use within this
   specification.  <a href="#section-4.4.4.2">Section 4.4.4.2</a> provides guidance for the
   specification designers in how to employ the extension mechanism in
   future specifications.

   A PACI packet consists of a payload header (denoted as PayloadHdr),
   for which the structure follows what is described in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>.
   The payload header is followed by the fields A, cType, PHSsize,
   F[0..2], and Y.

   Figure 11 shows a PACI packet in compliance with this memo, i.e.,
   without any extensions.

   The fields in the payload header are set as follows.  The F bit MUST
   be equal to 0.  The Type field MUST be equal to 50.  The value of
   LayerId MUST be a copy of the LayerId field of the PACI payload NAL
   unit or NAL-unit-like structure.  The value of TID MUST be a copy of
   the TID field of the PACI payload NAL unit or NAL-unit-like
   structure.

   The semantics of other fields are as follows:

   A: 1 bit
      Copy of the F bit of the PACI payload NAL unit or NAL-unit-like
      structure.

   cType: 6 bits
      Copy of the Type field of the PACI payload NAL unit or NAL-unit-
      like structure.

   PHSsize: 5 bits
      Indicates the length of the PHES field.  The value is limited to
      be less than or equal to 32 octets, to simplify encoder design for
      MTU size matching.

   F0:
      This field equal to 1 specifies the presence of a temporal
      scalability support extension in the PHES.

   F1, F2:
      MUST be 0, available for future extensions, see <a href="#section-4.4.4.2">Section 4.4.4.2</a>.
      Receivers compliant with this version of the HEVC payload format
      MUST ignore F1=1 and/or F2=1, and also ignore any information in
      the PHES indicated as present by F1=1 and/or F2=1.

         Informative note: The receiver can do that by first decoding
         information associated with F0=1, and then skipping over any
         remaining bytes of the PHES based on the value of PHSsize.

   Y: 1 bit
      MUST be 0, available for future extensions, see <a href="#section-4.4.4.2">Section 4.4.4.2</a>.
      Receivers compliant with this version of the HEVC payload format

         Informative note: The first two octets of the NAL unit or NAL-
         unit-like structure carried in the PACI payload are not
         included in the PACI payload.  Rather, the respective values
         are copied in locations of the PayloadHdr of the RTP packet.
         This design offers two advantages: first, the overall structure
         of the payload header is preserved, i.e., there is no special
         case of payload header structure that needs to be implemented
         for PACI.  Second, no additional overhead is introduced.

      A PACI payload MAY be a single NAL unit, an FU, or an AP.  PACIs
      MUST NOT be fragmented or aggregated.  The following subsection
      documents the reasons for these design choices.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.4.1.%20%20Reasons%20for%20the%20PACI%20Rules%20%28Informative%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.4.1" name="section-4.4.4.1">4.4.4.1</a>.  Reasons for the PACI Rules (Informative)</span>

   A PACI cannot be fragmented.  If a PACI could be fragmented, and a
   fragment other than the first fragment got lost, access to the
   information in the PACI would not be possible.  Therefore, a PACI
   must not be fragmented.  In other words, an FU must not carry
   (fragments of) a PACI.

   A PACI cannot be aggregated.  Aggregation of PACIs is inadvisable
   from a compression viewpoint, as, in many cases, several to be
   aggregated NAL units would share identical PACI fields and values
   which would be carried redundantly for no reason.  Most, if not all,
   of the practical effects of PACI aggregation can be achieved by
   aggregating NAL units and bundling them with a PACI (see below).
   Therefore, a PACI must not be aggregated.  In other words, an AP must
   not contain a PACI.

   The payload of a PACI can be a fragment.  Both middleboxes and
   sending systems with inflexible (often hardware-based) encoders
   occasionally find themselves in situations where a PACI and its
   headers, combined, are larger than the MTU size.  In such a scenario,
   the middlebox or sender can fragment the NAL unit and encapsulate the
   fragment in a PACI.  Doing so preserves the payload header extension
   information for all fragments, allowing downstream middleboxes and
   the receiver to take advantage of that information.  Therefore, a
   sender may place a fragment into a PACI, and a receiver must be able
   to handle such a PACI.

   The payload of a PACI can be an aggregation NAL unit.  HEVC
   bitstreams can contain unevenly sized and/or small (when compared to
   the MTU size) NAL units.  In order to efficiently packetize such
   small NAL units, APs were introduced.  The benefits of APs are
   independent from the need for a payload header extension.  Therefore,
   a sender may place an AP into a PACI, and a receiver must be able to
   handle such a PACI.

   This section includes recommendations for future specification
   designers on how to extent the PACI syntax to accommodate future
   extensions.  Obviously, designers are free to specify whatever
   appears to be appropriate to them at the time of their design.
   However, a lot of thought has been invested into the extension
   mechanism described below, and we suggest that deviations from it
   warrant a good explanation.

   This memo defines only a single payload header extension (TSCI,
   described in <a href="#section-4.5">Section 4.5</a>); therefore, only the F0 bit carries
   semantics.  F1 and F2 are already named (and not just marked as
   reserved, as a typical video spec designer would do).  They are
   intended to signal two additional extensions.  The Y bit allows one
   to, recursively, add further F and Y bits to extend the mechanism
   beyond three possible payload header extensions.  It is suggested to
   define a new packet type (using a different value for Type) when
   assigning the F1, F2, or Y bits different semantics than what is
   suggested below.

   When a Y bit is set, an 8-bit flag-extension is inserted after the Y
   bit.  A flag-extension consists of 7 flags F[n..n+6], and another Y
   bit.

   The basic PACI header already includes F0, F1, and F2.  Therefore,
   the Fx bits in the first flag-extensions are numbered F3, F4, ...,
   F9; the F bits in the second flag-extension are numbered F10, F11,
   ..., F16, and so forth.  As a result, at least three Fx bits are
   always in the PACI, but the number of Fx bits (and associated types
   of extensions) can be increased by setting the next Y bit and adding
   an octet of flag-extensions, carrying seven flags and another Y bit.
   The size of this list of flags is subject to the limits specified in
   <a href="#section-4.4.4">Section 4.4.4</a> (32 octets for all flag-extensions and the PHES
   information combined).

   Each of the F bits can indicate either the presence or the absence of
   certain information in the Payload Header Extension Structure (PHES).

   When a spec developer devises a new syntax that takes advantage of
   the PACI extension mechanism, he/she must follow the constraints
   listed below; otherwise, the extension mechanism may break.

      1) The fields added for a particular Fx bit MUST be fixed in
         length and not depend on what other Fx bits are set (no parsing
         dependency).

      2) The Fx bits must be assigned in order.

      3) An implementation that supports the n-th Fn bit for any value
         of n must understand the syntax (though not necessarily the
         semantics) of the fields Fk (with k &lt; n), so as to be able to
         either use those bits when present, or at least be able to skip
         over them.

   For each NAL unit, the variable AbsDon is derived, representing the
   decoding order number that is indicative of the NAL unit decoding
   order.

   Let NAL unit n be the n-th NAL unit in transmission order within an
   RTP stream.

   If sprop-max-don-diff is equal to 0 for all the RTP streams carrying
   the HEVC bitstream, AbsDon[n], the value of AbsDon for NAL unit n, is
   derived as equal to n.

   Otherwise (sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any of the RTP
   streams), AbsDon[n] is derived as follows, where DON[n] is the value
   of the variable DON for NAL unit n:

   o  If n is equal to 0 (i.e., NAL unit n is the very first NAL unit in
      transmission order), AbsDon[0] is set equal to DON[0].

   o  Otherwise (n is greater than 0), the following applies for
      derivation of AbsDon[n]:

      If DON[n] == DON[n-1],
          AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1]

      If (DON[n] &gt; DON[n-1] and DON[n] - DON[n-1] &lt; 32768),
          AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] + DON[n] - DON[n-1]

      If (DON[n] &lt; DON[n-1] and DON[n-1] - DON[n] &gt;= 32768),
          AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] + 65536 - DON[n-1] + DON[n]

      If (DON[n] &gt; DON[n-1] and DON[n] - DON[n-1] &gt;= 32768),
          AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] - (DON[n-1] + 65536 -
          DON[n])

      If (DON[n] &lt; DON[n-1] and DON[n-1] - DON[n] &lt; 32768),
          AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] - (DON[n-1] - DON[n])

   For any two NAL units m and n, the following applies:

   o  AbsDon[n] greater than AbsDon[m] indicates that NAL unit n follows
      NAL unit m in NAL unit decoding order.

   o  When AbsDon[n] is equal to AbsDon[m], the NAL unit decoding order
      of the two NAL units can be in either order.

   o  AbsDon[n] less than AbsDon[m] indicates that NAL unit n precedes
      NAL unit m in decoding order.

         Informative note: When two consecutive NAL units in the NAL
         unit decoding order have different values of AbsDon, the
         absolute difference between the two AbsDon values may be
         greater than or equal to 1.

         Informative note: There are multiple reasons to allow for the
         absolute difference of the values of AbsDon for two consecutive
         NAL units in the NAL unit decoding order to be greater than
         one.  An increment by one is not required, as at the time of
         associating values of AbsDon to NAL units, it may not be known
         whether all NAL units are to be delivered to the receiver.  For
         example, a gateway may not forward VCL NAL units of higher sub-
         layers or some SEI NAL units when there is congestion in the
         network.  In another example, the first intra-coded picture of
         a pre-encoded clip is transmitted in advance to ensure that it
         is readily available in the receiver, and when transmitting the
         first intra-coded picture, the originator does not exactly know
         how many NAL units will be encoded before the first intra-coded
         picture of the pre-encoded clip follows in decoding order.
         Thus, the values of AbsDon for the NAL units of the first
         intra-coded picture of the pre-encoded clip have to be
         estimated when they are transmitted, and gaps in values of
         AbsDon may occur.  Another example is MRST or MRMT with sprop-
         max-don-diff greater than 0, where the AbsDon values must
         indicate cross-layer decoding order for NAL units conveyed in
         all the RTP streams.

   The following packetization rules apply:

   o  If sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any of the RTP
      streams, the transmission order of NAL units carried in the RTP
      stream MAY be different than the NAL unit decoding order and the
      NAL unit output order.  Otherwise (sprop-max-don-diff is equal to
      0 for all the RTP streams), the transmission order of NAL units
      carried in the RTP stream MUST be the same as the NAL unit
      decoding order and, when tx-mode is equal to "MRST" or "MRMT",
      MUST also be the same as the NAL unit output order.

   o  A NAL unit of a small size SHOULD be encapsulated in an
      aggregation packet together with one or more other NAL units in
      order to avoid the unnecessary packetization overhead for small
      NAL units.  For example, non-VCL NAL units such as access unit
      delimiters, parameter sets, or SEI NAL units are typically small
      and can often be aggregated with VCL NAL units without violating
      MTU size constraints.

   o  Each non-VCL NAL unit SHOULD, when possible from an MTU size match
      viewpoint, be encapsulated in an aggregation packet together with
      its associated VCL NAL unit, as typically a non-VCL NAL unit would
      be meaningless without the associated VCL NAL unit being
      available.

   o  For carrying exactly one NAL unit in an RTP packet, a single NAL
      unit packet MUST be used.

   The general concept behind de-packetization is to get the NAL units
   out of the RTP packets in an RTP stream and all RTP streams the RTP
   stream depends on, if any, and pass them to the decoder in the NAL
   unit decoding order.

   The de-packetization process is implementation dependent.  Therefore,
   the following description should be seen as an example of a suitable
   implementation.  Other schemes may be used as well, as long as the
   output for the same input is the same as the process described below.
   The output is the same when the set of output NAL units and their
   order are both identical.  Optimizations relative to the described
   algorithms are possible.

   All normal RTP mechanisms related to buffer management apply.  In
   particular, duplicated or outdated RTP packets (as indicated by the
   RTP sequences number and the RTP timestamp) are removed.  To
   determine the exact time for decoding, factors such as a possible
   intentional delay to allow for proper inter-stream synchronization
   must be factored in.

   NAL units with NAL unit type values in the range of 0 to 47,
   inclusive, may be passed to the decoder.  NAL-unit-like structures
   with NAL unit type values in the range of 48 to 63, inclusive, MUST
   NOT be passed to the decoder.

   The receiver includes a receiver buffer, which is used to compensate
   for transmission delay jitter within individual RTP streams and
   across RTP streams, to reorder NAL units from transmission order to
   the NAL unit decoding order, and to recover the NAL unit decoding
   order in MRST or MRMT, when applicable.  In this section, the
   receiver operation is described under the assumption that there is no
   transmission delay jitter within an RTP stream and across RTP
   streams.  To make a difference from a practical receiver buffer that
   is also used for compensation of transmission delay jitter, the
   receiver buffer is hereafter called the de-packetization buffer in
   this section.  Receivers should also prepare for transmission delay
   jitter; that is, either reserve separate buffers for transmission
   delay jitter buffering and de-packetization buffering or use a
   receiver buffer for both transmission delay jitter and de-
   packetization.  Moreover, receivers should take transmission delay
   jitter into account in the buffering operation, e.g., by additional
   initial buffering before starting of decoding and playback.

   When sprop-max-don-diff is equal to 0 for all the received RTP
   streams, the de-packetization buffer size is zero bytes, and the
   process described in the remainder of this paragraph applies.  When
   there is only one RTP stream received, the NAL units carried in the
   single RTP stream are directly passed to the decoder in their
   transmission order, which is identical to their decoding order.  When
   there is more than one RTP stream received, the NAL units carried in
   the multiple RTP streams are passed to the decoder in their NTP
   timestamp order.  When there are several NAL units of different RTP
   streams with the same NTP timestamp, the order to pass them to the
   decoder is their dependency order, where NAL units of a dependee RTP
   stream are passed to the decoder prior to the NAL units of the
   dependent RTP stream.  When there are several NAL units of the same
   RTP stream with the same NTP timestamp, the order to pass them to the
   decoder is their transmission order.

      Informative note: The mapping between RTP and NTP timestamps is
      conveyed in RTCP SR packets.  In addition, the mechanisms for
      faster media timestamp synchronization discussed in [<a href="rfc6051.html" title='"Rapid Synchronisation of RTP Flows"'>RFC6051</a>] may
      be used to speed up the acquisition of the RTP-to-wall-clock
      mapping.

   When sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any the received RTP
   streams, the process described in the remainder of this section
   applies.

   There are two buffering states in the receiver: initial buffering and
   buffering while playing.  Initial buffering starts when the reception
   is initialized.  After initial buffering, decoding and playback are
   started, and the buffering-while-playing mode is used.

   Regardless of the buffering state, the receiver stores incoming NAL
   units, in reception order, into the de-packetization buffer.  NAL
   units carried in RTP packets are stored in the de-packetization
   buffer individually, and the value of AbsDon is calculated and stored
   for each NAL unit.  When MRST or MRMT is in use, NAL units of all RTP
   streams of a bitstream are stored in the same de-packetization
   buffer.  When NAL units carried in any two RTP streams are available
   to be placed into the de-packetization buffer, those NAL units
   carried in the RTP stream that is lower in the dependency tree are
   placed into the buffer first.  For example, if RTP stream A depends
   on RTP stream B, then NAL units carried in RTP stream B are placed
   into the buffer first.

   Initial buffering lasts until condition A (the difference between the
   greatest and smallest AbsDon values of the NAL units in the de-
   packetization buffer is greater than or equal to the value of sprop-
   max-don-diff of the highest RTP stream) or condition B (the number of
   NAL units in the de-packetization buffer is greater than the value of
   sprop-depack-buf-nalus) is true.

   After initial buffering, whenever condition A or condition B is true,
   the following operation is repeatedly applied until both condition A
   and condition B become false:

      o  The NAL unit in the de-packetization buffer with the smallest
         value of AbsDon is removed from the de-packetization buffer and
         passed to the decoder.

   When no more NAL units are flowing into the de-packetization buffer,
   all NAL units remaining in the de-packetization buffer are removed
   from the buffer and passed to the decoder in the order of increasing
   AbsDon values.

         These parameters indicate the profile, tier, default level, and
         some constraints of the bitstream carried by the RTP stream and
         all RTP streams the RTP stream depends on, or a specific set of
         the profile, tier, default level, and some constraints the
         receiver supports.

         The profile and some constraints are indicated collectively by
         profile-space, profile-id, profile-compatibility-indicator, and
         interop-constraints.  The profile specifies the subset of
         coding tools that may have been used to generate the bitstream
         or that the receiver supports.

            Informative note: There are 32 values of profile-id, and
            there are 32 flags in profile-compatibility-indicator, each
            flag corresponding to one value of profile-id.  According to
            HEVC version 1 in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>], when more than one of the 32 flags
            is set for a bitstream, the bitstream would comply with all
            the profiles corresponding to the set flags.  However, in a
            draft of HEVC version 2 in [<a href="#ref-HEVCv2" title='"High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Range Extensions text specification: Draft 7"'>HEVCv2</a>], Subclause A.3.5, 19
            Format Range Extensions profiles have been specified, all
            using the same value of profile-id (4), differentiated by
            some of the 48 bits in interop-constraints; this (rather
            unexpected way of profile signaling) means that one of the
            32 flags may correspond to multiple profiles.  To be able to
            support whatever HEVC extension profile that might be
            specified and indicated using profile-space, profile-id,
            profile-compatibility-indicator, and interop-constraints in
            the future, it would be safe to require symmetric use of
            these parameters in SDP offer/answer unless recv-sub-layer-
            id is included in the SDP answer for choosing one of the
            sub-layers offered.

         The tier is indicated by tier-flag.  The default level is
         indicated by level-id.  The tier and the default level specify
         the limits on values of syntax elements or arithmetic
         combinations of values of syntax elements that are followed
         when generating the bitstream or that the receiver supports.

         A set of profile-space, tier-flag, profile-id, profile-
         compatibility-indicator, interop-constraints, and level-id
         parameters ptlA is said to be consistent with another set of
         these parameters ptlB if any decoder that conforms to the
         profile, tier, level, and constraints indicated by ptlB can
         decode any bitstream that conforms to the profile, tier, level,
         and constraints indicated by ptlA.

         In SDP offer/answer, when the SDP answer does not include the
         recv-sub-layer-id parameter that is less than the sprop-sub-
         layer-id parameter in the SDP offer, the following applies:

            o  The profile-space, tier-flag, profile-id, profile-
               compatibility-indicator, and interop-constraints
               parameters MUST be used symmetrically, i.e., the value of
               each of these parameters in the offer MUST be the same as
               that in the answer, either explicitly signaled or
               implicitly inferred.

            o  The level-id parameter is changeable as long as the
               highest level indicated by the answer is either equal to
               or lower than that in the offer.  Note that the highest
               level is indicated by level-id and max-recv-level-id
               together.

         In SDP offer/answer, when the SDP answer does include the recv-
         sub-layer-id parameter that is less than the sprop-sub-layer-id
         parameter in the SDP offer, the set of profile-space, tier-
         flag, profile-id, profile-compatibility-indicator, interop-
         constraints, and level-id parameters included in the answer
         MUST be consistent with that for the chosen sub-layer
         representation as indicated in the SDP offer, with the
         exception that the level-id parameter in the SDP answer is
         changeable as long as the highest level indicated by the answer
         is either lower than or equal to that in the offer.

         More specifications of these parameters, including how they
         relate to the values of the profile, tier, and level syntax
         elements specified in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] are provided below.

      profile-space, profile-id:

         The value of profile-space MUST be in the range of 0 to 3,
         inclusive.  The value of profile-id MUST be in the range of 0
         to 31, inclusive.

         When profile-space is not present, a value of 0 MUST be
         inferred.  When profile-id is not present, a value of 1 (i.e.,
         the Main profile) MUST be inferred.

         When used to indicate properties of a bitstream, profile-space
         and profile-id are derived from the profile, tier, and level
         syntax elements in SPS or VPS NAL units as follows, where
         general_profile_space, general_profile_idc,
         sub_layer_profile_space[j], and sub_layer_profile_idc[j] are
         specified in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>]:

            If the RTP stream is the highest RTP stream, the following
            applies:

            o profile-space = general_profile_space
            o profile-id = general_profile_idc

            Otherwise (the RTP stream is a dependee RTP stream), the
            following applies, with j being the value of the sprop-sub-
            layer-id parameter:

            o profile-space = sub_layer_profile_space[j]
            o profile-id = sub_layer_profile_idc[j]

      tier-flag, level-id:

         The value of tier-flag MUST be in the range of 0 to 1,
         inclusive.  The value of level-id MUST be in the range of 0 to
         255, inclusive.

         If the tier-flag and level-id parameters are used to indicate
         properties of a bitstream, they indicate the tier and the
         highest level the bitstream complies with.

         If the tier-flag and level-id parameters are used for
         capability exchange, the following applies.  If max-recv-level-
         id is not present, the default level defined by level-id
         indicates the highest level the codec wishes to support.
         Otherwise, max-recv-level-id indicates the highest level the
         codec supports for receiving.  For either receiving or sending,
         all levels that are lower than the highest level supported MUST
         also be supported.

         If no tier-flag is present, a value of 0 MUST be inferred; if
         no level-id is present, a value of 93 (i.e., level 3.1) MUST be
         inferred.

         When used to indicate properties of a bitstream, the tier-flag
         and level-id parameters are derived from the profile, tier, and
         level syntax elements in SPS or VPS NAL units as follows, where

            If the RTP stream is the highest RTP stream, the following
            applies for each value of j in the range of 0 to 31,
            inclusive:

            o bit j of profile-compatibility-indicator =
                 sub_layer_profile_compatibility_flag[i][j]

         Using profile-compatibility-indicator for capability exchange
         results in a requirement on any bitstream to be compliant with

      max-recv-level-id:

         This parameter MAY be used to indicate the highest level a

         The value of tx-mode MUST be equal to "SRST", "MRST" or "MRMT".
         When not present, the value of tx-mode is inferred to be equal
         to "SRST".

         If the value is equal to "MRST", MRST MUST be in use.
         Otherwise, if the value is equal to "MRMT", MRMT MUST be in
         use.  Otherwise (the value is equal to "SRST"), SRST MUST be in
         use.

         The value of tx-mode MUST be equal to "MRST" for all RTP
         streams in an MRST.

         The value of tx-mode MUST be equal to "MRMT" for all RTP
         streams in an MRMT.

      sprop-vps:

         This parameter MAY be used to convey any video parameter set
         NAL unit of the bitstream for out-of-band transmission of video
         parameter sets.  The parameter MAY also be used for capability
         exchange and to indicate sub-stream characteristics (i.e.,
         properties of sub-layer representations as defined in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>]).
         The value of the parameter is a comma-separated (',') list of

         The sprop-vps parameter MAY contain one or more than one video
         parameter set NAL unit. However, all other video parameter sets
         contained in the sprop-vps parameter MUST be consistent with

         This parameter MAY be used to convey one or more SEI messages
         that describe bitstream characteristics.  When present, a

            Informative note: Intentionally, no list of applicable or
            inapplicable SEI messages is specified here.  Conveying
            certain SEI messages in sprop-sei may be sensible in some
            application scenarios and meaningless in others.  However, a
            few examples are described below:

               1) In an environment where the bitstream was created from
                  film-based source material, and no splicing is going
                  to occur during the lifetime of the session, the film
                  grain characteristics SEI message or the tone mapping
                  information SEI message are likely meaningful, and
                  sending them in sprop-sei rather than in the bitstream
                  at each entry point may help with saving bits and
                  allows one to configure the renderer only once,
                  avoiding unwanted artifacts.

               2) The structure of pictures information SEI message in
                  sprop-sei can be used to inform a decoder of
                  information on the NAL unit types, picture-order count
                  values, and prediction dependencies of a sequence of
                  pictures.  Having such knowledge can be helpful for
                  error recovery.

               3) Examples for SEI messages that would be meaningless to
                  be conveyed in sprop-sei include the decoded picture
                  hash SEI message (it is close to impossible that all
                  decoded pictures have the same hashtag), the display
                  orientation SEI message when the device is a handheld
                  device (as the display orientation may change when the
                  handheld device is turned around), or the filler
                  payload SEI message (as there is no point in just
                  having more bits in SDP).

      max-lsr, max-lps, max-cpb, max-dpb, max-br, max-tr, max-tc:

         These parameters MAY be used to signal the capabilities of a
         receiver implementation.  These parameters MUST NOT be used for
         any other purpose.  The highest level (specified by max-recv-
         level-id) MUST be the highest that the receiver is fully
         capable of supporting.  max-lsr, max-lps, max-cpb, max-dpb,
         max-br, max-tr, and max-tc MAY be used to indicate capabilities
         of the receiver that extend the required capabilities of the
         highest level, as specified below.

         When more than one parameter from the set (max-lsr, max-lps,
         max-cpb, max-dpb, max-br, max-tr, max-tc) is present, the
         receiver MUST support all signaled capabilities simultaneously.
         For example, if both max-lsr and max-br are present, the

         highest level with the extension of both the picture rate and
         bitrate is supported.  That is, the receiver is able to decode
         bitstreams in which the luma sample rate is up to max-lsr
         (inclusive), the bitrate is up to max-br (inclusive), the coded
         picture buffer size is derived as specified in the semantics of
         the max-br parameter below, and the other properties comply
         with the highest level specified by max-recv-level-id.

            Informative note: When the OPTIONAL media type parameters
            are used to signal the properties of a bitstream, and max-
            lsr, max-lps, max-cpb, max-dpb, max-br, max-tr, and max-tc
            are not present, the values of profile-space, tier-flag,
            profile-id, profile-compatibility-indicator, interop-
            constraints, and level-id must always be such that the
            bitstream complies fully with the specified profile, tier,
            and level.

      max-lsr:

         The value of max-lsr is an integer indicating the maximum
         processing rate in units of luma samples per second.  The max-
         lsr parameter signals that the receiver is capable of decoding
         video at a higher rate than is required by the highest level.

         When max-lsr is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to decode
         bitstreams that conform to the highest level, with the
         exception that the MaxLumaSR value in Table A-2 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for
         the highest level is replaced with the value of max-lsr.
         Senders MAY use this knowledge to send pictures of a given size
         at a higher picture rate than is indicated in the highest
         level.

         When not present, the value of max-lsr is inferred to be equal
         to the value of MaxLumaSR given in Table A-2 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the
         highest level.

         The value of max-lsr MUST be in the range of MaxLumaSR to 16 *
         MaxLumaSR, inclusive, where MaxLumaSR is given in Table A-2 of
         [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the highest level.

      max-lps:

         The value of max-lps is an integer indicating the maximum
         picture size in units of luma samples.  The max-lps parameter
         signals that the receiver is capable of decoding larger picture
         sizes than are required by the highest level.  When max-lps is
         signaled, the receiver MUST be able to decode bitstreams that
         conform to the highest level, with the exception that the

         MaxLumaPS value in Table A-1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the highest level is
         replaced with the value of max-lps.  Senders MAY use this
         knowledge to send larger pictures at a proportionally lower
         picture rate than is indicated in the highest level.

         When not present, the value of max-lps is inferred to be equal
         to the value of MaxLumaPS given in Table A-1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the

         [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the highest level.

      max-cpb:

         The value of max-cpb is an integer indicating the maximum coded
         picture buffer size in units of CpbBrVclFactor bits for the VCL
         HRD parameters and in units of CpbBrNalFactor bits for the NAL
         HRD parameters, where CpbBrVclFactor and CpbBrNalFactor are
         defined in Section A.4 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>].  The max-cpb parameter
         signals that the receiver has more memory than the minimum
         amount of coded picture buffer memory required by the highest
         level.  When max-cpb is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to
         decode bitstreams that conform to the highest level, with the
         exception that the MaxCPB value in Table A-1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the
         highest level is replaced with the value of max-cpb.  Senders
         MAY use this knowledge to construct coded bitstreams with
         greater variation of bitrate than can be achieved with the
         MaxCPB value in Table A-1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>].

         When not present, the value of max-cpb is inferred to be equal
         to the value of MaxCPB given in Table A-1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the
         highest level.

         The value of max-cpb MUST be in the range of MaxCPB to 16 *
         MaxCPB, inclusive, where MaxLumaCPB is given in Table A-1 of
         [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the highest level.

            Informative note: The coded picture buffer is used in the
            hypothetical reference decoder (Annex C of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>]).  The use
            of the hypothetical reference decoder is recommended in HEVC
            encoders to verify that the produced bitstream conforms to
            the standard and to control the output bitrate.  Thus, the
            coded picture buffer is conceptually independent of any
            other potential buffers in the receiver, including de-
            packetization and de-jitter buffers.  The coded picture
            buffer need not be implemented in decoders as specified in
            Annex C of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>], but rather standard-compliant decoders

            can have any buffering arrangements provided that they can
            decode standard-compliant bitstreams.  Thus, in practice,
            the input buffer for a video decoder can be integrated with
            de-packetization and de-jitter buffers of the receiver.

      max-dpb:

         The value of max-dpb is an integer indicating the maximum
         decoded picture buffer size in units decoded pictures at the
         MaxLumaPS for the highest level, i.e., the number of decoded
         pictures at the maximum picture size defined by the highest
         level.  The value of max-dpb MUST be in the range of 1 to 16,
         respectively.  The max-dpb parameter signals that the receiver
         has more memory than the minimum amount of decoded picture
         buffer memory required by default, which is MaxDpbPicBuf as
         defined in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] (equal to 6).  When max-dpb is signaled, the
         receiver MUST be able to decode bitstreams that conform to the
         highest level, with the exception that the MaxDpbPicBuff value
         defined in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] as 6 is replaced with the value of max-dpb.
         Consequently, a receiver that signals max-dpb MUST be capable
         of storing the following number of decoded pictures
         (MaxDpbSize) in its decoded picture buffer:

           if( PicSizeInSamplesY &lt;= ( MaxLumaPS &gt;&gt; 2 ) )
              MaxDpbSize = Min( 4 * max-dpb, 16 )
           else if ( PicSizeInSamplesY &lt;= ( MaxLumaPS &gt;&gt; 1 ) )
              MaxDpbSize = Min( 2 * max-dpb, 16 )
           else if ( PicSizeInSamplesY &lt;= ( ( 3 * MaxLumaPS ) &gt;&gt; 2
         ) )
              MaxDpbSize = Min( (4 * max-dpb) / 3, 16 )
           else
              MaxDpbSize = max-dpb

         Wherein MaxLumaPS given in Table A-1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the highest
         level and PicSizeInSamplesY is the current size of each decoded
         picture in units of luma samples as defined in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>].

         The value of max-dpb MUST be greater than or equal to the value
         of MaxDpbPicBuf (i.e., 6) as defined in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>].  Senders MAY
         use this knowledge to construct coded bitstreams with improved
         compression.

         When not present, the value of max-dpb is inferred to be equal
         to the value of MaxDpbPicBuf (i.e., 6) as defined in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>].

            Informative note: This parameter was added primarily to

            decoded picture buffer stores reconstructed samples.  There
            is no relationship between the size of the decoded picture
            buffer and the buffers used in RTP, especially de-
            packetization and de-jitter buffers.

      max-br:

         The value of max-br is an integer indicating the maximum video
         bitrate in units of CpbBrVclFactor bits per second for the VCL
         HRD parameters and in units of CpbBrNalFactor bits per second
         for the NAL HRD parameters, where CpbBrVclFactor and
         CpbBrNalFactor are defined in Section A.4 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>].

         The max-br parameter signals that the video decoder of the
         receiver is capable of decoding video at a higher bitrate than
         is required by the highest level.

         When max-br is signaled, the video codec of the receiver MUST
         be able to decode bitstreams that conform to the highest level,
         with the following exceptions in the limits specified by the
         highest level:

            o  The value of max-br replaces the MaxBR value in Table A-2
               of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the highest level.

            o  When the max-cpb parameter is not present, the result of
               the following formula replaces the value of MaxCPB in
               Table A-1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>]:

               (MaxCPB of the highest level) * max-br / (MaxBR of the
               highest level)

         For example, if a receiver signals capability for Main profile
         Level 2 with max-br equal to 2000, this indicates a maximum
         video bitrate of 2000 kbits/sec for VCL HRD parameters, a
         maximum video bitrate of 2200 kbits/sec for NAL HRD parameters,
         and a CPB size of 2000000 bits (2000000 / 1500000 * 1500000).

         Senders MAY use this knowledge to send higher bitrate video as
         allowed in the level definition of Annex A of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] to achieve

         The value of max-br MUST be in the range of MaxBR to 16 *
         MaxBR, inclusive, where MaxBR is given in Table A-2 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>]
         for the highest level.

            Informative note: This parameter was added primarily to
            complement a similar codepoint in the ITU-T Recommendation
            H.245, so as to facilitate signaling gateway designs.  The
            assumption that the network is capable of handling such
            bitrates at any given time cannot be made from the value of
            this parameter.  In particular, no conclusion can be drawn
            that the signaled bitrate is possible under congestion
            control constraints.

      max-tr:

         The value of max-tr is an integer indication the maximum number
         of tile rows.  The max-tr parameter signals that the receiver
         is capable of decoding video with a larger number of tile rows
         than the value allowed by the highest level.

         When max-tr is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to decode
         bitstreams that conform to the highest level, with the
         exception that the MaxTileRows value in Table A-1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for
         the highest level is replaced with the value of max-tr.

         Senders MAY use this knowledge to send pictures utilizing a
         larger number of tile rows than the value allowed by the
         highest level.

         When not present, the value of max-tr is inferred to be equal
         to the value of MaxTileRows given in Table A-1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for
         the highest level.

         The value of max-tr MUST be in the range of MaxTileRows to 16 *
         MaxTileRows, inclusive, where MaxTileRows is given in Table A-1
         of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the highest level.

      max-tc:

         The value of max-tc is an integer indication the maximum number
         of tile columns.  The max-tc parameter signals that the
         receiver is capable of decoding video with a larger number of
         tile columns than the value allowed by the highest level.

         When max-tc is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to decode
         bitstreams that conform to the highest level, with the
         exception that the MaxTileCols value in Table A-1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for
         the highest level is replaced with the value of max-tc.

         Senders MAY use this knowledge to send pictures utilizing a
         larger number of tile columns than the value allowed by the
         highest level.

         When not present, the value of max-tc is inferred to be equal
         to the value of MaxTileCols given in Table A-1 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for
         the highest level.

         The value of max-tc MUST be in the range of MaxTileCols to 16 *
         MaxTileCols, inclusive, where MaxTileCols is given in Table A-1
         of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] for the highest level.

      max-fps:

         The value of max-fps is an integer indicating the maximum
         picture rate in units of pictures per 100 seconds that can be
         effectively processed by the receiver.  The max-fps parameter
         MAY be used to signal that the receiver has a constraint in
         that it is not capable of processing video effectively at the
         full picture rate that is implied by the highest level and,
         when present, one or more of the parameters max-lsr, max-lps,
         and max-br.

         The value of max-fps is not necessarily the picture rate at
         which the maximum picture size can be sent, it constitutes a
         constraint on maximum picture rate for all resolutions.

            Informative note: The max-fps parameter is semantically
            different from max-lsr, max-lps, max-cpb, max-dpb, max-br,
            max-tr, and max-tc in that max-fps is used to signal a
            constraint, lowering the maximum picture rate from what is
            implied by other parameters.

         The encoder MUST use a picture rate equal to or less than this
         value.  In cases where the max-fps parameter is absent, the
         encoder is free to choose any picture rate according to the
         highest level and any signaled optional parameters.

         The value of max-fps MUST be smaller than or equal to the full
         picture rate that is implied by the highest level and, when
         present, one or more of the parameters max-lsr, max-lps, and
         max-br.

      sprop-max-don-diff:

         If tx-mode is equal to "SRST" and there is no NAL unit naluA
         that is followed in transmission order by any NAL unit
         preceding naluA in decoding order (i.e., the transmission order
         of the NAL units is the same as the decoding order), the value
         of this parameter MUST be equal to 0.

         Otherwise, if tx-mode is equal to "MRST" or "MRMT", the
         decoding order of the NAL units of all the RTP streams is the
         same as the NAL unit transmission order and the NAL unit output
         order, the value of this parameter MUST be equal to either 0 or
         1.

         Otherwise, if tx-mode is equal to "MRST" or "MRMT" and the
         decoding order of the NAL units of all the RTP streams is the

         NAL unit output order, the value of this parameter MUST be
         equal to 1.

         Otherwise, this parameter specifies the maximum absolute
         difference between the decoding order number (i.e., AbsDon)
         values of any two NAL units naluA and naluB, where naluA
         follows naluB in decoding order and precedes naluB in
         transmission order.

         The value of sprop-max-don-diff MUST be an integer in the range

         When not present, the value of sprop-max-don-diff is inferred
         to be equal to 0.

      sprop-depack-buf-nalus:

         This parameter specifies the maximum number of NAL units that
         precede a NAL unit in transmission order and follow the NAL

      sprop-depack-buf-bytes:

         This parameter signals the required size of the de-
         packetization buffer in units of bytes.  The value of the
         parameter MUST be greater than or equal to the maximum buffer
         occupancy (in units of bytes) of the de-packetization buffer as
         specified in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.

         The value of sprop-depack-buf-bytes MUST be an integer in the
         range of 0 to 4294967295, inclusive.

         When sprop-max-don-diff is present and greater than 0, this
         parameter MUST be present and the value MUST be greater than 0.
         When not present, the value of sprop-depack-buf-bytes is
         inferred to be equal to 0.

            Informative note: The value of sprop-depack-buf-bytes
            indicates the required size of the de-packetization buffer
            only.  When network jitter can occur, an appropriately sized
            jitter buffer has to be available as well.

      depack-buf-cap:

         This parameter signals the capabilities of a receiver
         implementation and indicates the amount of de-packetization
         buffer space in units of bytes that the receiver has available
         for reconstructing the NAL unit decoding order from NAL units
         carried in one or more RTP streams.  A receiver is able to
         handle any RTP stream, and all RTP streams the RTP stream
         depends on, when present, for which the value of the sprop-
         depack-buf-bytes parameter is smaller than or equal to this
         parameter.

         When not present, the value of depack-buf-cap is inferred to be

      sprop-segmentation-id:

         This parameter MAY be used to signal the segmentation tools
         present in the bitstream and that can be used for
         parallelization.  The value of sprop-segmentation-id MUST be an
         integer in the range of 0 to 3, inclusive.  When not present,
         the value of sprop-segmentation-id is inferred to be equal to
         0.

         When sprop-segmentation-id is equal to 0, no information about
         the segmentation tools is provided.  When sprop-segmentation-id
         is equal to 1, it indicates that slices are present in the
         bitstream.  When sprop-segmentation-id is equal to 2, it
         indicates that tiles are present in the bitstream.  When sprop-
         segmentation-id is equal to 3, it indicates that WPP is used in
         the bitstream.

      sprop-spatial-segmentation-idc:

         A base16 [<a href="rfc4648.html" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>RFC4648</a>] representation of the syntax element
         min_spatial_segmentation_idc as specified in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>].  This
         parameter MAY be used to describe parallelization capabilities
         of the bitstream.

      dec-parallel-cap:

         This parameter MAY be used to indicate the decoder's additional
         decoding capabilities given the presence of tools enabling
         parallel decoding, such as slices, tiles, and WPP, in the
         bitstream.  The decoding capability of the decoder may vary
         with the setting of the parallel decoding tools present in the
         bitstream, e.g., the size of the tiles that are present in a
         bitstream.  Therefore, multiple capability points may be
         provided, each indicating the minimum required decoding
         capability that is associated with a parallelism requirement,
         which is a requirement on the bitstream that enables parallel
         decoding.

         Each capability point is defined as a combination of 1) a
         parallelism requirement, 2) a profile (determined by profile-
         space and profile-id), 3) a highest level, and 4) a maximum
         processing rate, a maximum picture size, and a maximum video
         bitrate that may be equal to or greater than that determined by
         the highest level.  The parameter's syntax in ABNF [<a href="rfc5234.html" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>] is
         as follows:

         The set of capability points expressed by the dec-parallel-cap
         parameter is enclosed in a pair of curly braces ("{}").  Each
         set of two consecutive capability points is separated by a
         comma (',').  Within each capability point, each set of two
         consecutive parameters, and, when present, their values, is
         separated by a semicolon (';').

         The profile of all capability points is determined by profile-
         space and profile-id, which are outside the dec-parallel-cap
         parameter.

         Each capability point starts with an indication of the
         parallelism requirement, which consists of a parallel tool
         type, which may be equal to 'w' or 't', and a decimal value of
         the spatial-seg-idc parameter.  When the type is 'w', the
         capability point is valid only for H.265 bitstreams with WPP in
         use, i.e., entropy_coding_sync_enabled_flag equal to 1.  When
         the type is 't', the capability point is valid only for H.265
         bitstreams with WPP not in use (i.e.,
         entropy_coding_sync_enabled_flag equal to 0).  The capability-
         point is valid only for H.265 bitstreams with
         min_spatial_segmentation_idc equal to or greater than spatial-
         seg-idc.

         After the parallelism requirement indication, each capability
         point continues with one or more pairs of parameter and value
         in any order for any of the following parameters:

            o tier-flag
            o level-id
            o max-lsr
            o max-lps
            o max-br

         At most, one occurrence of each of the above five parameters is
         allowed within each capability point.

         The values of dec-parallel-cap.tier-flag and dec-parallel-
         cap.level-id for a capability point indicate the highest level
         of the capability point.  The values of dec-parallel-cap.max-
         lsr, dec-parallel-cap.max-lps, and dec-parallel-cap.max-br for
         a capability point indicate the maximum processing rate in

         units of luma samples, and the maximum video bitrate (in units
         of CpbBrVclFactor bits per second for the VCL HRD parameters
         and in units of CpbBrNalFactor bits per second for the NAL HRD
         parameters where CpbBrVclFactor and CpbBrNalFactor are defined

         The general decoding capability, expressed by the set of
         parameters outside of dec-parallel-cap, is defined as the
         capability point that is determined by the following
         combination of parameters: 1) the parallelism requirement
         corresponding to the value of sprop-segmentation-id equal to 0
         for a bitstream, 2) the profile determined by profile-space,
         profile-id, profile-compatibility-indicator, and interop-
         constraints, 3) the tier and the highest level determined by
         tier-flag and max-recv-level-id, and 4) the maximum processing
         rate, the maximum picture size, and the maximum video bitrate
         determined by the highest level.  The general decoding
         capability MUST NOT be included as one of the set of capability

         For example, the following parameters express the general
         decoding capability of 720p30 (Level 3.1) plus an additional
         decoding capability of 1080p30 (Level 4) given that the

            present in a bitstream and WPP is not used, [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>] specifies
            that there is no slice or no tile in the bitstream
            containing more than 4 * PicSizeInSamplesY / (
            min_spatial_segmentation_idc + 4 ) luma samples.

      include-dph:

         This parameter is used to indicate the capability and
         preference to utilize or include Decoded Picture Hash (DPH) SEI
         messages (see Section D.3.19 of [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>]) in the bitstream. DPH
         SEI messages can be used to detect picture corruption so the
         receiver can request picture repair, see <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.  The value
         is a comma-separated list of hash types that is supported or
         requested to be used, each hash type provided as an unsigned
         integer value (0-255), with the hash types listed from most
         preferred to the least preferred.  Example: "include-dph=0,2",
         which indicates the capability for MD5 (most preferred) and
         Checksum (less preferred).  If the parameter is not included or
         the value contains no hash types, then no capability to utilize
         DPH SEI messages is assumed.  Note that DPH SEI messages MAY
         still be included in the bitstream even when there is no
         declaration of capability to use them, as in general SEI
         messages do not affect the normative decoding process and
         decoders are allowed to ignore SEI messages.

   Encoding considerations:

      This type is only defined for transfer via RTP (<a href="rfc3550.html">RFC 3550</a>).

      source attribute, these parameters are only associated with the
      given source and payload type as parts of the "fmtp" source

   When HEVC is offered over RTP using SDP in an offer/answer model
   [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>] for negotiation for unicast usage, the following
   limitations and rules apply:

   o  The parameters identifying a media format configuration for HEVC
      are profile-space, profile-id, tier-flag, level-id, interop-
      constraints, profile-compatibility-indicator, and tx-mode.  These
      media configuration parameters, except level-id, MUST be used
      symmetrically when the answerer does not include recv-sub-layer-id

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7798.html">RFC 7798</a>               RTP Payload Format for HEVC            March 2016</span>


      in the answer for the media format (payload type) or the included
      recv-sub-layer-id is equal to sprop-sub-layer-id in the offer.
      The answerer MUST:

      1) maintain all configuration parameters with the values remaining
         the same as in the offer for the media format (payload type),
         with the exception that the value of level-id is changeable as
         long as the highest level indicated by the answer is not higher
         than that indicated by the offer;

      2) include in the answer the recv-sub-layer-id parameter, with a
         value less than the sprop-sub-layer-id parameter in the offer,
         for the media format (payload type), and maintain all
         configuration parameters with the values being the same as
         signaled in the sprop-vps for the chosen sub-layer
         representation, with the exception that the value of level-id
         is changeable as long as the highest level indicated by the
         answer is not higher than the level indicated by the sprop-vps
         in offer for the chosen sub-layer representation; or

      3) remove the media format (payload type) completely (when one or
         more of the parameter values are not supported).

            Informative note: The above requirement for symmetric use
            does not apply for level-id, and does not apply for the
            other bitstream or RTP stream properties and capability
            parameters.

   o  The profile-compatibility-indicator, when offered as sendonly,
      describes bitstream properties.  The answerer MAY accept an RTP
      payload type even if the decoder is not capable of handling the
      profile indicated by the profile-space, profile-id, and interop-
      constraints parameters, but capable of any of the profiles
      indicated by the profile-space, profile-compatibility-indicator,
      and interop-constraints.  However, when the profile-compatibility-
      indicator is used in a recvonly or sendrecv media description, the
      bitstream using this RTP payload type is required to conform to
      all profiles indicated by profile-space, profile-compatibility-
      indicator, and interop-constraints.

   o  To simplify handling and matching of these configurations, the
      same RTP payload type number used in the offer SHOULD also be used
      in the answer, as specified in [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>].

   o  The same RTP payload type number used in the offer for the media
      subtype H265 MUST be used in the answer when the answer includes
      recv-sub-layer-id.  When the answer does not include recv-sub-
      layer-id, the answer MUST NOT contain a payload type number used

      in the offer for the media subtype H265 unless the configuration
      is exactly the same as in the offer or the configuration in the
      answer only differs from that in the offer with a different value
      of level-id.  The answer MAY contain the recv-sub-layer-id
      parameter if an HEVC bitstream contains multiple operation points
      (using temporal scalability and sub-layers) and sprop-vps is
      included in the offer where information of sub-layers are present
      in the first video parameter set contained in sprop-vps.  If the
      sprop-vps is provided in an offer, an answerer MAY select a
      particular operation point indicated in the first video parameter
      set contained in sprop-vps.  When the answer includes a recv-sub-
      layer-id that is less than a sprop-sub-layer-id in the offer, all
      video parameter sets contained in the sprop-vps parameter in the
      SDP answer and all video parameter sets sent in-band for either
      the offerer-to-answerer direction or the answerer-to-offerer
      direction MUST be consistent with the first video parameter set in
      the sprop-vps parameter of the offer (see the semantics of sprop-
      vps in <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a> of this document on one video parameter set
      being consistent with another video parameter set), and the
      bitstream sent in either direction MUST conform to the profile,
      tier, level, and constraints of the chosen sub-layer
      representation as indicated by the first profile_tier_level( )
      syntax structure in the first video parameter set in the sprop-vps
      parameter of the offer.

         Informative note: When an offerer receives an answer that does
         not include recv-sub-layer-id, it has to compare payload types
         not declared in the offer based on the media type (i.e.,
         video/H265) and the above media configuration parameters with
         any payload types it has already declared.  This will enable it
         to determine whether the configuration in question is new or if
         it is equivalent to configuration already offered, since a
         different payload type number may be used in the answer.  The
         ability to perform operation point selection enables a receiver
         to utilize the temporal scalable nature of an HEVC bitstream.

   o  The parameters sprop-max-don-diff, sprop-depack-buf-nalus, and
      sprop-depack-buf-bytes describe the properties of an RTP stream,
      and all RTP streams the RTP stream depends on, when present, that
      the offerer or the answerer is sending for the media format
      configuration.  This differs from the normal usage of the
      offer/answer parameters: normally such parameters declare the
      properties of the bitstream or RTP stream that the offerer or the
      answerer is able to receive.  When dealing with HEVC, the offerer
      assumes that the answerer will be able to receive media encoded
      using the configuration being offered.

         Informative note:  The above parameters apply for any RTP
         stream and all RTP streams the RTP stream depends on, when
         present, sent by a declaring entity with the same
         configuration.  In other words, the applicability of the above
         parameters to RTP streams depends on the source endpoint.
         Rather than being bound to the payload type, the values may
         have to be applied to another payload type when being sent, as
         they apply for the configuration.

   o  The capability parameters max-lsr, max-lps, max-cpb, max-dpb, max-
      br, max-tr, and max-tc MAY be used to declare further capabilities
      of the offerer or answerer for receiving.  These parameters MUST
      NOT be present when the direction attribute is sendonly.

   o  The capability parameter max-fps MAY be used to declare lower
      capabilities of the offerer or answerer for receiving.  The
      parameters MUST NOT be present when the direction attribute is
      sendonly.

   o  The capability parameter dec-parallel-cap MAY be used to declare
      additional decoding capabilities of the offerer or answerer for
      receiving.  Upon receiving such a declaration of a receiver, a
      sender MAY send a bitstream to the receiver utilizing those
      capabilities under the assumption that the bitstream fulfills the
      parallelism requirement.  A bitstream that is sent based on
      choosing a capability point with parallel tool type 'w' from dec-
      parallel-cap MUST have entropy_coding_sync_enabled_flag equal to 1
      and min_spatial_segmentation_idc equal to or larger than dec-
      parallel-cap.spatial-seg-idc of the capability point.  A bitstream
      that is sent based on choosing a capability point with parallel
      tool type 't' from dec-parallel-cap MUST have
      entropy_coding_sync_enabled_flag equal to 0 and
      min_spatial_segmentation_idc equal to or larger than dec-parallel-
      cap.spatial-seg-idc of the capability point.

   o  An offerer has to include the size of the de-packetization buffer,
      sprop-depack-buf-bytes, as well as sprop-max-don-diff and sprop-
      depack-buf-nalus, in the offer for an interleaved HEVC bitstream
      or for the MRST or MRMT transmission mode when sprop-max-don-diff
      is greater than 0 for at least one of the RTP streams.  To enable
      the offerer and answerer to inform each other about their
      capabilities for de-packetization buffering in receiving RTP
      streams, both parties are RECOMMENDED to include depack-buf-cap.
      For interleaved RTP streams or in MRST or MRMT, it is also
      RECOMMENDED to consider offering multiple payload types with
      different buffering requirements when the capabilities of the
      receiver are unknown.

   o  The capability parameter include-dph MAY be used to declare the
      capability to utilize decoded picture hash SEI messages and which
      types of hashes in any HEVC RTP streams received by the offerer or
      answerer.

   o  The sprop-vps, sprop-sps, or sprop-pps, when present (included in

      attribute as specified in <a href="rfc5576.html#section-6.3">Section 6.3 of [RFC5576]</a>), are used for
      out-of-band transport of the parameter sets (VPS, SPS, or PPS,
      respectively).

   o  The answerer MAY use either out-of-band or in-band transport of
      parameter sets for the bitstream it is sending, regardless of
      whether out-of-band parameter sets transport has been used in the
      offerer-to-answerer direction.  Parameter sets included in an
      answer are independent of those parameter sets included in the
      offer, as they are used for decoding two different bitstreams, one
      from the answerer to the offerer and the other in the opposite
      direction.  In case some RTP streams are sent before the SDP
      offer/answer settles down, in-band parameter sets MUST be used for
      those RTP stream parts sent before the SDP offer/answer.

   o  The following rules apply to transport of parameter set in the
      offerer-to-answerer direction.

      +  An offer MAY include sprop-vps, sprop-sps, and/or sprop-pps.
         If none of these parameters is present in the offer, then only
         in-band transport of parameter sets is used.

      +  If the level to use in the offerer-to-answerer direction is
         equal to the default level in the offer, the answerer MUST be
         prepared to use the parameter sets included in sprop-vps,
         sprop-sps, and sprop-pps (either included in the "a=fmtp" line
         of SDP or conveyed using the "fmtp" source attribute) for
         decoding the incoming bitstream, e.g., by passing these
         parameter set NAL units to the video decoder before passing any
         NAL units carried in the RTP streams.  Otherwise, the answerer
         MUST ignore sprop-vps, sprop-sps, and sprop-pps (either
         included in the "a=fmtp" line of SDP or conveyed using the
         "fmtp" source attribute) and the offerer MUST transmit
         parameter sets in-band.

      +  In MRST or MRMT, the answerer MUST be prepared to use the
         parameter sets out-of-band transmitted for the RTP stream and
         all RTP streams the RTP stream depends on, when present, for
         decoding the incoming bitstream, e.g., by passing these
         parameter set NAL units to the video decoder before passing any
         NAL units carried in the RTP streams.

   o  The following rules apply to transport of parameter set in the
      answerer-to-offerer direction.

      +  An answer MAY include sprop-vps, sprop-sps, and/or sprop-pps.
         If none of these parameters is present in the answer, then only
         in-band transport of parameter sets is used.

      +  The offerer MUST be prepared to use the parameter sets included
         in sprop-vps, sprop-sps, and sprop-pps (either included in the
         "a=fmtp" line of SDP or conveyed using the "fmtp" source
         attribute) for decoding the incoming bitstream, e.g., by
         passing these parameter set NAL units to the video decoder

         decoding the incoming bitstream, e.g., by passing these
         parameter set NAL units to the video decoder before passing any
         NAL units carried in the RTP streams.

   o  When sprop-vps, sprop-sps, and/or sprop-pps are conveyed using the
      "fmtp" source attribute as specified in <a href="rfc5576.html#section-6.3">Section 6.3 of [RFC5576]</a>,
      the receiver of the parameters MUST store the parameter sets
      included in sprop-vps, sprop-sps, and/or sprop-pps and associate
      them with the source given as part of the "fmtp" source attribute.
      Parameter sets associated with one source (given as part of the
      "fmtp" source attribute) MUST only be used to decode NAL units
      conveyed in RTP packets from the same source (given as part of the
      "fmtp" source attribute).  When this mechanism is in use, SSRC
      collision detection and resolution MUST be performed as specified

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7798.html">RFC 7798</a>               RTP Payload Format for HEVC            March 2016</span>


   Parameters used for declaring receiver capabilities are, in general,
   downgradable; i.e., they express the upper limit for a sender's
   possible behavior.  Thus, a sender MAY select to set its encoder
   using only lower/lesser or equal values of these parameters.

   When the answer does not include a recv-sub-layer-id that is less
   than the sprop-sub-layer-id in the offer, parameters declaring a
   configuration point are not changeable, with the exception of the
   level-id parameter for unicast usage, and these parameters express
   values a receiver expects to be used and MUST be used verbatim in the
   answer as in the offer.

   When a sender's capabilities are declared with the configuration
   parameters, these parameters express a configuration that is
   acceptable for the sender to receive bitstreams.  In order to achieve
   high interoperability levels, it is often advisable to offer multiple
   alternative configurations.  It is impossible to offer multiple
   configurations in a single payload type.  Thus, when multiple
   configuration offers are made, each offer requires its own RTP
   payload type associated with the offer.  However, it is possible to
   offer multiple operation points using one configuration in a single
   payload type by including sprop-vps in the offer and recv-sub-layer-
   id in the answer.

   A receiver SHOULD understand all media type parameters, even if it
   only supports a subset of the payload format's functionality.  This
   ensures that a receiver is capable of understanding when an offer to
   receive media can be downgraded to what is supported by the receiver
   of the offer.

   An answerer MAY extend the offer with additional media format
   configurations.  However, to enable their usage, in most cases a
   second offer is required from the offerer to provide the bitstream
   property parameters that the media sender will use.  This also has
   the effect that the offerer has to be able to receive this media
   format configuration, not only to send it.

   When HEVC over RTP is offered with SDP in a declarative style, as in
   Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [<a href="rfc2326.html" title='"Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)"'>RFC2326</a>] or Session Announcement

      o  All parameters capable of indicating both bitstream properties
         and receiver capabilities are used to indicate only bitstream
         properties.  For example, in this case, the parameter profile-
         tier-level-id declares the values used by the bitstream, not
         the capabilities for receiving bitstreams.  As a result, the
         following interpretation of the parameters MUST be used:

         + Declaring actual configuration or bitstream properties:
            - profile-space
            - profile-id
            - tier-flag

            - sprop-depack-buf-bytes
            - sprop-segmentation-id
            - sprop-spatial-segmentation-idc

         + Not usable (when present, they MUST be ignored):
            - max-lps
            - max-lsr
            - max-cpb
            - max-dpb
            - max-br
            - max-tr

            - max-recv-level-id
            - depack-buf-cap
            - sprop-sub-layer-id
            - dec-parallel-cap
            - include-dph

      o  A receiver of the SDP is required to support all parameters and
         values of the parameters provided; otherwise, the receiver MUST
         reject (RTSP) or not participate in (SAP) the session.  It
         falls on the creator of the session to use values that are
         expected to be supported by the receiving application.

   When out-of-band transport of parameter sets is used, parameter sets
   MAY still be additionally transported in-band unless explicitly
   disallowed by an application, and some of these additional parameter
   sets may update some of the out-of-band transported parameter sets.
   Update of a parameter set refers to the sending of a parameter set of
   the same type using the same parameter set ID but with different
   values for at least one other parameter of the parameter set.

   If MRST or MRMT is used, the rules on signaling media decoding
   dependency in SDP as defined in [<a href="rfc5583.html" title='"Signaling Media Decoding Dependency in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC5583</a>] apply.  The rules on
   "hierarchical or layered encoding" with multicast in <a href="rfc4566.html#section-5.7">Section 5.7 of
   [RFC4566]</a> do not apply.  This means that the notation for Connection

   sub-field &lt;number of addresses&gt; in the sub-field &lt;connection-address&gt;
   of the "c=" field, described in [<a href="rfc4566.html" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>], must not be present.  The

   the lowest temporal sub-layer to the RTP stream containing the
   highest temporal sub-layer.

   The following subsections define the use of the Picture Loss
   Indication (PLI), Slice Lost Indication (SLI), Reference Picture
   Selection Indication (RPSI), and Full Intra Request (FIR) feedback
   messages with HEVC.  The PLI, SLI, and RPSI messages are defined in
   [<a href="rfc4585.html" title='"Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)"'>RFC4585</a>], and the FIR message is defined in [<a href="rfc5104.html" title='"Codec Control Messages in the RTP Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF)"'>RFC5104</a>].

   As specified in <a href="rfc4585.html#section-6.3.1">RFC 4585, Section 6.3.1</a>, the reception of a PLI by a
   media sender indicates "the loss of an undefined amount of coded
   video data belonging to one or more pictures".  Without having any
   specific knowledge of the setup of the bitstream (such as use and
   location of in-band parameter sets, non-IDR decoder refresh points,
   picture structures, and so forth), a reaction to the reception of an
   PLI by an HEVC sender SHOULD be to send an IDR picture and relevant
   parameter sets; potentially with sufficient redundancy so to ensure
   correct reception.  However, sometimes information about the
   bitstream structure is known.  For example, state could have been
   established outside of the mechanisms defined in this document that
   parameter sets are conveyed out of band only, and stay static for the
   duration of the session.  In that case, it is obviously unnecessary
   to send them in-band as a result of the reception of a PLI.  Other

   examples could be devised based on a priori knowledge of different
   aspects of the bitstream structure.  In all cases, the timing and
   congestion control mechanisms of <a href="rfc4585.html">RFC 4585</a> MUST be observed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.2.%20%20Slice%20Loss%20Indication%20%28SLI%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" name="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Slice Loss Indication (SLI)</span>

   The SLI described in <a href="rfc4585.html">RFC 4585</a> can be used to indicate, to a sender,
   the loss of a number of Coded Tree Blocks (CTBs) in a CTB raster scan
   order of a picture.  In the SLI's Feedback Control Indication (FCI)
   field, the subfield "First" MUST be set to the CTB address of the
   first lost CTB.  Note that the CTB address is in CTB-raster-scan
   order of a picture.  For the first CTB of a slice segment, the CTB
   address is the value of slice_segment_address when present, or 0 when
   the value of first_slice_segment_in_pic_flag is equal to 1; both
   syntax elements are in the slice segment header.  The subfield
   "Number" MUST be set to the number of consecutive lost CTBs, again in
   CTB-raster-scan order of a picture.  Note that due to both the
   "First" and "Number" being counted in CTBs in CTB-raster-scan order,
   of a picture, not in tile-scan order (which is the bitstream order of
   CTBs), multiple SLI messages may be needed to report the loss of one
   tile covering multiple CTB rows but less wide than the picture.

   The subfield "PictureID" MUST be set to the 6 least significant bits
   of a binary representation of the value of PicOrderCntVal, as defined
   in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>], of the picture for which the lost CTBs are indicated.
   Note that for IDR pictures the syntax element slice_pic_order_cnt_lsb
   is not present, but then the value is inferred to be equal to 0.

   As described in <a href="rfc4585.html">RFC 4585</a>, an encoder in a media sender can use this
   information to "clean up" the corrupted picture by sending intra
   information, while observing the constraints described in <a href="rfc4585.html">RFC 4585</a>,
   for example, with respect to congestion control.  In many cases,
   error tracking is required to identify the corrupted region in the
   receiver's state (reference pictures) because of error import in
   uncorrupted regions of the picture through motion compensation.
   Reference-picture selection can also be used to "clean up" the
   corrupted picture, which is usually more efficient and less likely to
   generate congestion than sending intra information.

   In contrast to the video codecs contemplated in RFCs 4585 and 5104
   [<a href="rfc5104.html" title='"Codec Control Messages in the RTP Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF)"'>RFC5104</a>], in HEVC, the "macroblock size" is not fixed to 16x16 luma
   samples, but is variable.  That, however, does not create a
   conceptual difficulty with SLI, because the setting of the CTB size
   is a sequence-level functionality, and using a slice loss indication
   across CVS boundaries is meaningless as there is no prediction across
   sequence boundaries.  However, a proper use of SLI messages is not as
   straightforward as it was with older, fixed-macroblock-sized video

   codecs, as the state of the sequence parameter set (where the CTB
   size is located) has to be taken into account when interpreting the
   "First" subfield in the FCI.

   Feedback-based reference picture selection has been shown as a
   powerful tool to stop temporal error propagation for improved error
   resilience [<a href="#ref-Girod99" title='"Feedback-based error control for mobile video transmission"'>Girod99</a>][Wang05].  In one approach, the decoder side
   tracks errors in the decoded pictures and informs the encoder side
   that a particular picture that has been decoded relatively earlier is
   correct and still present in the decoded picture buffer; it requests
   the encoder to use that correct picture-availability information when
   encoding the next picture, so to stop further temporal error
   propagation.  For this approach, the decoder side should use the RPSI
   feedback message.

   Encoders can encode some long-term reference pictures as specified in
   H.264 or HEVC for purposes described in the previous paragraph
   without the need of a huge decoded picture buffer.  As shown in
   [<a href="#ref-Wang05" title='"Error resilient video coding using flexible reference fames"'>Wang05</a>], with a flexible reference picture management scheme, as in
   H.264 and HEVC, even a decoded picture buffer size of two picture
   storage buffers would work for the approach described in the previous
   paragraph.

   The field "Native RPSI bit string defined per codec" is a base16
   [<a href="rfc4648.html" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>RFC4648</a>] representation of the 8 bits consisting of the 2 most
   significant bits equal to 0 and 6 bits of nuh_layer_id, as defined in
   [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>], followed by the 32 bits representing the value of the
   PicOrderCntVal (in network byte order), as defined in [<a href="#ref-HEVC" title='"High efficiency video coding"'>HEVC</a>], for the
   picture that is indicated by the RPSI feedback message.

   The use of the RPSI feedback message as positive acknowledgement with
   HEVC is deprecated.  In other words, the RPSI feedback message MUST
   only be used as a reference picture selection request, such that it
   can also be used in multicast.

   The purpose of the FIR message is to force an encoder to send an

   <a href="rfc5104.html">5104</a>).

   typical example for that is an understanding between sender and
   receiver, established by means outside this document, that parameter
   sets are exclusively sent out-of-band.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The scope of this Security Considerations section is limited to the
   payload format itself and to one feature of HEVC that may pose a
   particularly serious security risk if implemented naively.  The
   payload format, in isolation, does not form a complete system.
   Implementers are advised to read and understand relevant security-
   related documents, especially those pertaining to RTP (see the
   Security Considerations section in [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>]), and the security of
   the call-control stack chosen (that may make use of the media type
   registration of this memo).  Implementers should also consider known
   security vulnerabilities of video coding and decoding implementations
   in general and avoid those.

   Within this RTP payload format, and with the exception of the user
   data SEI message as described below, no security threats other than
   those common to RTP payload formats are known.  In other words,
   neither the various media-plane-based mechanisms, nor the signaling
   part of this memo, seems to pose a security risk beyond those common
   to all RTP-based systems.

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>], and in any applicable RTP profile such as
   RTP/AVP [<a href="rfc3551.html" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>], RTP/AVPF [<a href="rfc4585.html" title='"Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/AVPF)"'>RFC4585</a>], RTP/SAVP [<a href="rfc3711.html" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>], or
   RTP/SAVPF [<a href="rfc5124.html" title='"Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"'>RFC5124</a>].  However, as "Securing the RTP Framework: Why
   RTP Does Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution" [<a href="rfc7202.html" title='"Securing the RTP Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution"'>RFC7202</a>]
   discusses, it is not an RTP payload format's responsibility to
   discuss or mandate what solutions are used to meet the basic security
   goals like confidentiality, integrity and source authenticity for RTP
   in general.  This responsibility lays on anyone using RTP in an
   application.  They can find guidance on available security mechanisms
   and important considerations in "Options for Securing RTP Sessions"
   [<a href="rfc7201.html" title='"Options for Securing RTP Sessions"'>RFC7201</a>].  Applications SHOULD use one or more appropriate strong
   security mechanisms.  The rest of this section discusses the security
   impacting properties of the payload format itself.

   Because the data compression used with this payload format is applied
   end-to-end, any encryption needs to be performed after compression.
   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
   into the bitstream that are complex to decode and that cause the
   receiver to be overloaded.  H.265 is particularly vulnerable to such



<span class="grey">Wang, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 78]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7798.html">RFC 7798</a>               RTP Payload Format for HEVC            March 2016</span>


   attacks, as it is extremely simple to generate datagrams containing
   NAL units that affect the decoding process of many future NAL units.
   Therefore, the usage of data origin authentication and data integrity
   protection of at least the RTP packet is RECOMMENDED, for example,
   with SRTP [<a href="rfc3711.html" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>].

   Like [<a href="#ref-H.264" title='"Advanced video coding for generic audiovisual services"'>H.264</a>], HEVC includes a user data Supplemental Enhancement
   Information (SEI) message.  This SEI message allows inclusion of an
   arbitrary bitstring into the video bitstream.  Such a bitstring could
   include JavaScript, machine code, and other active content.  HEVC
   leaves the handling of this SEI message to the receiving system.  In
   order to avoid harmful side effects of the user data SEI message,
   decoder implementations cannot naively trust its content.  For
   example, it would be a bad and insecure implementation practice to
   forward any JavaScript a decoder implementation detects to a web
   browser.  The safest way to deal with user data SEI messages is to
   simply discard them, but that can have negative side effects on the
   quality of experience by the user.

   End-to-end security with authentication, integrity, or
   confidentiality protection will prevent a MANE from performing media-
   aware operations other than discarding complete packets.  In the case
   of confidentiality protection, it will even be prevented from
   discarding packets in a media-aware way.  To be allowed to perform
   such operations, a MANE is required to be a trusted entity that is
   included in the security context establishment.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.%20%20Congestion%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" name="section-10">10</a>.  Congestion Control</span>

   Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RTP
   [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and with any applicable RTP profile, e.g., AVP [<a href="rfc3551.html" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>].
   If best-effort service is being used, an additional requirement is
   that users of this payload format MUST monitor packet loss to ensure
   that the packet loss rate is within an acceptable range.  Packet loss
   is considered acceptable if a TCP flow across the same network path,
   and experiencing the same network conditions, would achieve an
   average throughput, measured on a reasonable timescale, that is not
   less than all RTP streams combined is achieving.  This condition can
   be satisfied by implementing congestion-control mechanisms to adapt
   the transmission rate, the number of layers subscribed for a layered
   multicast session, or by arranging for a receiver to leave the
   session if the loss rate is unacceptably high.

   The bitrate adaptation necessary for obeying the congestion control
   principle is easily achievable when real-time encoding is used, for
   example, by adequately tuning the quantization parameter.





<span class="grey">Wang, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 79]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7798.html">RFC 7798</a>               RTP Payload Format for HEVC            March 2016</span>


   However, when pre-encoded content is being transmitted, bandwidth
   adaptation requires the pre-coded bitstream to be tailored for such
   adaptivity.  The key mechanism available in HEVC is temporal
   scalability.  A media sender can remove NAL units belonging to higher
   temporal sub-layers (i.e., those NAL units with a high value of TID)
   until the sending bitrate drops to an acceptable range.  HEVC
   contains mechanisms that allow the lightweight identification of
   switching points in temporal enhancement layers, as discussed in
   <a href="#section-1.1.2">Section 1.1.2</a> of this memo.  An HEVC media sender can send packets
   belonging to NAL units of temporal enhancement layers starting from
   these switching points to probe for available bandwidth and to
   utilized bandwidth that has been shown to be available.

   Above mechanisms generally work within a defined profile and level
   and, therefore, no renegotiation of the channel is required.  Only
   when non-downgradable parameters (such as profile) are required to be
   changed does it become necessary to terminate and restart the RTP
   stream(s).  This may be accomplished by using different RTP payload
   types.

   MANEs MAY remove certain unusable packets from the RTP stream when
   that RTP stream was damaged due to previous packet losses.  This can
   help reduce the network load in certain special cases.  For example,
   MANES can remove those FUs where the leading FUs belonging to the
   same NAL unit have been lost or those dependent slice segments when
   the leading slice segments belonging to the same slice have been
   lost, because the trailing FUs or dependent slice segments are
   meaningless to most decoders.  MANES can also remove higher temporal
   scalable layers if the outbound transmission (from the MANE's
   viewpoint) experiences congestion.
