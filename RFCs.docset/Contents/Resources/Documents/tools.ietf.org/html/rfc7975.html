Abstract

   The Request Routing interface comprises (1) the asynchronous
   advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a downstream Content
   Delivery Network (CDN) that allows an upstream CDN to decide whether
   to redirect particular user requests to that downstream CDN; and (2)
   the synchronous operation of an upstream CDN requesting whether a
   downstream CDN is prepared to accept a user request and of a
   downstream CDN responding with how to actually redirect the user
   request.  This document describes an interface for the latter part,
   i.e., the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface.

   A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system built on an existing IP
   network that is used for large-scale content delivery, via
   prefetching or dynamically caching content on its distributed
   surrogates (caching servers).  [<a href="rfc6707.html" title='"Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Problem Statement"'>RFC6707</a>] describes the problem area
   of interconnecting CDNs.

   The CDNI Request Routing interface outlined in [<a href="rfc7336.html" title='"Framework for Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI)"'>RFC7336</a>] is comprised
   of:

   1.  The asynchronous advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a
       downstream CDN (dCDN) that allows an upstream CDN (uCDN) to
       decide whether to redirect particular user requests to that dCDN.

   2.  The synchronous operation of a uCDN requesting whether a dCDN is
       prepared to accept a user request and of a dCDN responding with
       how to actually redirect the user request.

   This document describes an interface for the latter part, i.e., the
   CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface (RI).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   This document reuses the terminology defined in [<a href="rfc6707.html" title='"Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Problem Statement"'>RFC6707</a>].

   The following additional terms are introduced by this document:

   Application-Level Redirection:  The act of using an application-
      specific redirection mechanism for the request routing process of
      a CDN.  The Redirection Target (RT) is the result of a CDN's
      routing decision at the time it receives a content request via an
      application-specific protocol response.  Examples of an
      application-level redirection are HTTP 302 Redirection and Real
      Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) [<a href="#ref-RTMP" title='"Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) specification"'>RTMP</a>] 302 Redirection.

   DNS Redirection:  The act of using DNS name resolution for the
      request routing process of a CDN.  In DNS Redirection, the DNS
      name server of the CDN makes the routing decision based on a local
      policy and selects one or more Redirection Targets (RTs) and
      redirects the User Agent (UA) to the RT(s) by returning the
      details of the RT(s) in response to the DNS query request from the
      User Agent's DNS resolver.

   HTTP Redirection:  The act of using an HTTP redirection response for
      the request routing process of a CDN.  The Redirection Target (RT)
      is the result of the routing decision of a CDN at the time it
      receives a content request via HTTP.  HTTP Redirection is a
      particular case of application-level redirection.

   Redirection Target (RT):  The endpoint to which the User Agent is
      redirected.  In CDNI, an RT may point to a number of different
      components, some examples include a surrogate in the same CDN as
      the request router, a request router in a dCDN, or a surrogate in
      a dCDN.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Interface%20Function%20and%20Operation%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Interface Function and Operation Overview</span>

   The main function of the CDNI Redirection interface (RI) is to allow
   the request routing systems in interconnected CDNs to communicate to
   facilitate the redirection of User Agent requests between
   interconnected CDNs.

   The detailed requirements for the Redirection interface and their
   relative priorities are described in <a href="rfc7337.html#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC7337]</a>.

   The User Agent will make a request to a request router in the uCDN
   using one of either DNS or HTTP.  The RI is used between the uCDN and
   one or more dCDNs.  The dCDN's RI response may contain a Redirection
   Target with a type that is compatible with the protocol used between
   the User Agent and uCDN request router.  The dCDN has control over
   the Redirection Target it provides.  Depending on the returned
   Redirection Target, the User Agent's request may be redirected to:

   o  The final surrogate, which may be in the dCDN that returned the RI
      response to the uCDN or another CDN (if the dCDN delegates the
      delivery to another CDN); or

   o  A request router (in the dCDN or another CDN), which may use a
      different redirection protocol (DNS or HTTP) than the one included
      in the RI request.

   The Redirection interface operates between the request routing
   systems of a pair of interconnected CDNs.  To enable communication
   over the Redirection interface, the uCDN needs to know the URI
   (endpoint) in the dCDN to send CDNI request routing queries.

   The Redirection interface URI may be statically preconfigured,
   dynamically discovered via the CDNI Control interface, or discovered
   via other means.  However, such discovery mechanisms are not
   specified in this document, as they are considered out of the scope
   of the Redirection interface specification.

   The Redirection interface is only relevant in the case of Recursive
   Request Redirection, as Iterative Request Redirection does not invoke
   any interaction over the Redirection interface between interconnected
   CDNs.  Therefore, the scope of this document is limited to Recursive
   Request Redirection.

   In the case of Recursive Request Redirection, in order to perform
   redirection of a request received from a User Agent, the uCDN queries
   the dCDN so that the dCDN can select and provide a Redirection
   Target.  In cases where a uCDN has a choice of dCDNs, it is up to the
   uCDN to decide (for example, via configured policies) which dCDN(s)
   to query and in which order to query them.  A number of strategies
   are possible, including selecting a preferred dCDN based on local
   policy, possibly falling back to querying an alternative dCDN(s) if
   the first dCDN does not return a Redirection Target or otherwise
   rejects the uCDN's RI request.  A more complex strategy could be to
   query multiple dCDNs in parallel before selecting one and using the
   Redirection Target provided by that dCDN.

   The uCDN-&gt;User Agent redirection protocols addressed in this document
   are: DNS redirection and HTTP redirection.  Other types of
   application-level redirection will not be discussed further in this
   document.  However, the Redirection interface is designed to be
   extensible and could be extended to support additional application-
   level redirection protocols.

   For both DNS and HTTP redirection, either HTTP or HTTPS could be used
   to connect to the Redirection Target.  When HTTPS is used to connect
   to the uCDN, if the uCDN uses DNS redirection to identify the RT to
   the User Agent, then the new target domain name may not match the
   domain in the URL dereferenced to reach the uCDN; without operational
   precautions, and in the absence of DNSSEC, this can make a legitimate
   redirection look like a DNS-based attack to a User Agent and trigger
   security warnings.  When DNS-based redirection with HTTPS is used,
   this specification assumes that any RT can complete the necessary
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake with the User Agent.  Any
   operational mechanisms this requires, e.g., private key distribution
   to surrogates and request routers in dCDNs, are outside the scope of
   this document.

   This document also defines an RI loop prevention and detection
   mechanism as part of the Redirection interface.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20HTTP-Based%20Interface%20for%20the%20Redirection%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  HTTP-Based Interface for the Redirection Interface</span>

   This document defines a simple interface for the Redirection
   interface based on HTTP [<a href="rfc7230.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>], where the attributes of a User
   Agent's requests are encapsulated along with any other data that can
   aid the dCDN in processing the requests.  The RI response
   encapsulates the attributes of the RT(s) that the uCDN should return
   to the User Agent (if it decides to utilize the dCDN for delivery)
   along with the policy for how the response can be reused.  The
   examples of RI requests and responses below do not contain a complete
   set of HTTP headers for brevity; only the pertinent HTTP headers are
   shown.

   The RI between the uCDN and dCDN uses the same HTTP interface to
   encapsulate the attributes of both DNS and HTTP requests received
   from User Agents, although the contents of the RI requests/responses
   contain data specific to either DNS or HTTP redirection.

   This approach has been chosen because it enables CDN operators to
   only have to deploy a single interface for the RI between their CDNs,
   regardless of the User Agent redirection method.  In this way, from
   an operational point of view, there is only one interface to monitor,
   manage, develop troubleshooting tools for, etc.

   In addition, having a single RI where the attributes of the User
   Agent's DNS or HTTP request are encapsulated along with the other
   data required for the dCDN to make a request routing decision, avoids
   having to both 1) try to encapsulate or proxy DNS/HTTP/RTMP/
   etc. requests and 2) find ways to somehow embed the additional CDNI
   Request Routing Redirection interface properties/data within those
   end-user DNS/HTTP/RTMP/etc. requests.

   Finally, the RI is easily extendable to support other User Agent
   request redirection methods (e.g., RTMP 302 redirection) by defining
   additional protocol-specific keys for RI requests and responses along
   with a specification about how to process them.

   The generic Recursive Request Redirection message flow between
   Request Routing systems in a pair of interconnected CDNs is as
   follows:

   User Agent                CDN B RR                  CDN A RR

       Figure 1: Generic Recursive Request Redirection Message Flow

   1.  The User Agent sends its (DNS or HTTP) request to CDN A.  The
       Request Routing System of CDN A processes the request and,
       through local policy, recognizes that the request is best served
       by another CDN, specifically CDN B (or that CDN B may be one of a
       number of candidate dCDNs it could use).

   2.  The Request Routing System of CDN A sends an HTTP POST to CDN B's
       RI URI containing the attributes of the User Agent's request.

   3.  The Request Routing System of CDN B processes the RI request and,
       assuming the request is well-formed, responds with an HTTP "200"
       response with a message body containing the RT(s) to return to
       the User Agent as well as parameters that indicate the properties
       of the response (cacheability and scope).

   4.  The Request Routing System of CDN A sends a protocol-specific
       response (containing the returned attributes) to the User Agent,
       so that the User Agent's request will be redirected to the RT(s)
       returned by CDN B.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Information%20Passed%20in%20RI%20Requests%20and%20Responses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Information Passed in RI Requests and Responses</span>

   The information passed in RI requests splits into two basic
   categories:

   1.  The attributes of the User Agent's request to the uCDN.

   2.  Properties/parameters that the uCDN can use to control the dCDN's
       response or that can help the dCDN make its decision.

   Generally, dCDNs can provide better routing decisions given
   additional information about the content request, e.g., the URI of
   the requested content or the User Agent's IP address or subnet.  The
   information required to base a routing decision on can be highly
   dependent on the type of content delivered.  A uCDN SHOULD only
   include information that is absolutely necessary for delivering that
   type of content.  Cookies in particular are especially sensitive from
   a security/privacy point of view and in general SHOULD NOT be
   conveyed in the RI Requests to the dCDN.  The information necessary
   to be conveyed for a particular type of request is expected to be
   conveyed out of band between the uCDN and dCDN.  See <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a> for
   more detail on the privacy aspects of using RI Requests to convey
   information about UA requests.

   In order for the dCDN to determine whether it is capable of
   delivering any requested content, it requires CDNI metadata related
   to the content the User Agent is requesting.  That metadata will
   describe the content and any policies associated with it.  It is
   expected that the RI request contains sufficient information for the
   Request Router in the dCDN to be able to retrieve the required CDNI
   Metadata via the CDNI Metadata interface.

   The information passed in RI responses splits into two basic
   categories:

   1.  The attributes of the RT to return to the User Agent in the DNS
       response or HTTP response.

   2.  Parameters/policies that indicate the properties of the response,
       such as, whether it is cacheable, the scope of the response, etc.

   In addition to details about how to redirect the User Agent, the dCDN
   may wish to return additional policy information to the uCDN.  For
   example, the dCDN may wish to return a policy that expresses "this
   response can be reused without requiring an RI request for 60 seconds
   provided the User Agent's IP address is in the range 198.51.100.0 --
   198.51.100.255".

   These additional policies split into two basic categories:

   o  Cacheability information signaled via the HTTP response headers of
      the RI response (to reduce the number of subsequent RI requests
      the uCDN needs to make).

   o  The scope of a cacheable response signaled in the HTTP response
      body of the RI response, for example, whether the response applies
      to a wider range of IP addresses than what was included in the RI
      request.

   The cacheability of the response is indicated using the standard HTTP
   Cache-Control mechanisms.

   A single request or response MUST contain only one of the dns or http
   keys.  Requests MUST contain a cdn-path key and responses MAY contain
   a cdn-path key.  If the max-hops key is not present, then there is no
   limit on the number of CDN hops that the RI request can be propagated
   along.  If the first uCDN does not wish the RI request to be
   propagated beyond the dCDN it is making the request to, then the uCDN
   MUST set max-hops to 1.

   The cdn-path MAY be reflected back in RI responses, although doing so
   could expose information to the uCDN that a dCDN may not wish to
   expose (for example, the existence of business relationships between
   a dCDN and other CDNs).

   If the cdn-path is reflected back in the RI response, it MUST contain
   the value of cdn-path received in the associated RI request with the
   final dCDN's CDN Provider ID appended.  Transit CDNs MAY remove the
   cdn-path from RI responses but MUST NOT modify the cdn-path in other
   ways.

   The presence of an error key within a response that also contains
   either a dns or http key does not automatically indicate that the RI
   request was unsuccessful as the error key MAY be used for
   communicating additional (e.g., debugging) information.  When a
   response contains an error key as well as either a dns or http key,
   the error-code SHOULD be 1xx (e.g., 100).  See <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a> for more
   details about encoding error information in RI responses.

   All implementations that support IPv4 addresses MUST support the
   encoding specified by the 'IPv4address' rule in <a href="rfc3986.html#section-3.2.2">Section 3.2.2 of
   [RFC3986]</a>.  Likewise, implementations that support IPv6 addresses
   MUST support all IPv6 address formats specified in [<a href="rfc4291.html" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>RFC4291</a>].  Server
   implementations SHOULD use IPv6 address formats specified in
   [<a href="rfc5952.html" title='"A Recommendation for IPv6 Address Text Representation"'>RFC5952</a>].

   For DNS-based redirection, the uCDN needs to pass the following
   information to the dCDN in the RI request:

   o  The IP address of the DNS resolver that made the DNS request to
      the uCDN.

   o  The type of DNS query made (usually either A or AAAA).

   o  The class of DNS query made (usually IN).

   o  The fully qualified domain name for which DNS redirection is being
      requested.

   o  The IP address or prefix of the User Agent (if known to the uCDN).

   An example RI request (uCDN-&gt;dCDN) for DNS-based redirection is as
   follows:

   POST /dcdn/ri HTTP/1.1
   Host: rr1.dcdn.example.net
   Content-Type: application/cdni; ptype=redirection-request

   For a successful DNS-based redirection, the dCDN needs to return one
   of the following to the uCDN in the RI response:

   o  The IP address(es) of (or the CNAME of) RTs that are dCDN
      surrogates (if the dCDN is performing DNS-based redirection
      directly to a surrogate); or

   o  The IP address(es) of (or the CNAME of) RTs that are Request
      Routers (if the dCDN will perform request redirection itself).  A
      dCDN MUST NOT return an RT that is a Request Router if the dns-
      only key is set to True in the RI request.

   A successful RI response for DNS-based redirection MUST include a dns
   dictionary and MAY include an error dictionary (see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>).  An
   unsuccessful RI response for DNS-based redirection MUST include an
   error dictionary.  If a dns dictionary is included in the RI
   response, it MUST include the rcode and name keys and it MUST include
   at least one of the following keys: a, aaaa, or cname.  The dns
   dictionary MAY include both a and aaaa keys.  If the dns dictionary
   contains a cname key, it MUST NOT contain either an a or aaaa key.
   For internationalized domain names containing non-ASCII characters,
   the value of the cname field MUST be the ACE representation (A-label)
   of the domain name.

   The dictionary keys used in HTTP Redirection requests and responses
   use the following conventions for their prefixes:

      Agent).

   o  cs- is prefixed to keys for information passed by the Client (User

   o  The IP address of the User Agent.

   o  The URI requested by the User Agent.

   o  The HTTP method requested by the User Agent.

   o  The HTTP version number requested by the User Agent.

                                  Table 4

   An RI request for HTTP-based redirection MUST include an http
   dictionary.  This http dictionary MUST contain the following keys:
   c-ip, cs-method, cs-version, and cs-uri; the value of each MUST be
   the value of the appropriate part of the User Agent's HTTP request.

   The http dictionary of an RI request MUST contain a maximum of one
   cs-(&lt;headername&gt;) key for each unique header field-name (HTTP header
   field).  &lt;headername&gt; MUST be identical to the equivalent HTTP header
   field-name encoded in all lowercase.

   In the case where the User Agent request includes multiple HTTP
   header fields with the same field-name, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   uCDN combine these different HTTP headers into a single value
   according to <a href="rfc7230.html#section-3.2.2">Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7230]</a>.  However, because of the
   plurality of already defined HTTP header fields and the inconsistency
   of some of these header fields concerning the combination mechanism
   defined in <a href="rfc7230.html">RFC 7230</a>, the uCDN MAY have to deviate from using the
   combination mechanism where appropriate.  For example, it might only
   send the contents of the first occurrence of the HTTP Headers
   instead.

   An example RI request (uCDN-&gt;dCDN) for HTTP-based redirection is as
   follows:

   POST /dcdn/rrri HTTP/1.1
   Host: rr1.dcdn.example.net
   Content-Type: application/cdni; ptype=redirection-request
   Accept: application/cdni; ptype=redirection-response

   {
     "http": {
       "c-ip": "198.51.100.1",
       "cs-uri": "http://www.example.com",
       "cs-version": "HTTP/1.1",
       "cs-method": "GET"
     },
     "cdn-path": ["AS64496:0"],
     "max-hops": 3
   }

   For a successful HTTP-based redirection, the dCDN needs to return one
   of the following to the uCDN in the RI response:

   o  A URI pointing to an RT that is the selected dCDN surrogate(s) (if
      the dCDN is performing HTTP-based redirection directly to a
      surrogate); or

   o  A URI pointing to an RT that is a Request Router (if the dCDN will
      perform request redirection itself).

   Note: The sc-(location) key in the preceding table is an example of
   sc-(&lt;headername&gt;) that has been called out separately as its presence
   is mandatory in RI responses.

   A successful RI response for HTTP-based redirection MUST include an
   http dictionary and MAY include an error dictionary (see
   <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>).  An unsuccessful RI response for HTTP-based redirection
   MUST include an error dictionary.  If an http dictionary is included
   in the RI response, it MUST include at least the following keys:
   sc-status, sc-version, sc-reason, cs-uri, and sc-(location).

   The http dictionary of an RI response MUST contain a maximum of one
   sc-(&lt;headername&gt;) key for each unique header field-name (HTTP header
   field).  &lt;headername&gt; MUST be identical to the equivalent HTTP header
   field-name encoded in all lowercase.

   The uCDN MAY decide to not return, override, or alter any or all of
   the HTTP headers defined by sc-(&lt;headername&gt;) keys before sending the
   HTTP response to the UA.  It should be noted that in some cases,
   sending the HTTP Headers indicated by the dCDN transparently on to
   the UA might result in, for the uCDN, undesired behavior.  As an
   example, the dCDN might include sc-(cache-control),
   sc-(last-modified), and sc-(expires) keys in the http dictionary,
   through which the dCDN may try to influence the cacheability of the
   response by the UA.  If the uCDN would pass these HTTP headers on to
   the UA, this could mean that further requests from the uCDN would go
   directly to the dCDN, bypassing the uCDN and any logging it may
   perform on incoming requests.  Therefore, the uCDN is recommended to
   carefully consider which HTTP headers to pass on, and which to either
   override or not pass on at all.

   An example of a successful RI response (dCDN-&gt;uCDN) for HTTP-based
   redirection is a follows:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Date: Mon, 06 Aug 2012 18:41:38 GMT

   RI responses may be cacheable.  As long as a cached RI response is
   not stale according to standard HTTP Cache-Control or other
   applicable mechanisms, it may be reused by the uCDN in response to
   User Agent requests without sending another RI request to the dCDN.

   An RI response MUST NOT be reused unless the request from the User
   Agent would generate an identical RI request to the dCDN as the one
   that resulted in the cached RI response (except for the c-ip field
   provided that the User Agent's c-ip is covered by the scope in the
   original RI response, as elaborated upon below).

   Additionally, although RI requests only encode a single User Agent
   request to be redirected, there may be cases where a dCDN wishes to
   indicate to the uCDN that the RI response can be reused for other
   User Agent requests without the uCDN having to make another request
   via the RI.  For example, a dCDN may know that it will always select
   the same surrogates for a given set of User Agent IP addresses and in
   order to reduce request volume across the RI or to remove the
   additional latency associated with an RI request, the dCDN may wish
   to indicate that set of User Agent IP addresses to the uCDN in the
   initial RI response.  This is achieved by including an optional scope
   dictionary in the RI response.

   Scope is encoded as a set of key:value pairs within the scope
   dictionary as follows:

   +---------+--------+-----------+------------------------------------+
   | Key     | Value  | Mandatory | Description                        |
   +---------+--------+-----------+------------------------------------+
   | iprange | List   | No        | A List of IP subnets in CIDR       |
   |         | of     |           | notation that this RI response can |
   |         | String |           | be reused for, provided the RI     |
   |         |        |           | response is still considered       |
   |         |        |           | fresh.                             |
   +---------+--------+-----------+------------------------------------+

                                  Table 6

   If a uCDN has multiple cached responses with overlapping scopes and a
   UA request comes in for which the User Agent's IP matches with the IP
   subnets in multiple of these cached responses, the uCDN SHOULD use
   the most recent cached response when determining the appropriate RI
   response to use.

   From a uCDN perspective, there are two types of errors that can be
   the result of the transmission of an RI request to a dCDN:

   1.  An HTTP protocol error signaled via an HTTP status code,
       indicating a problem with the reception or parsing of the RI
       request or the generation of the RI response by the dCDN, and

   2.  An RI-level error specified in an RI response message.

   This section deals with the latter type.  The former type is outside
   the scope of this document.

   There are numerous reasons for a dCDN to be unable to return an
   affirmative RI response to a uCDN.  Reasons may include both dCDN
   internal issues such as capacity problems, as well as reasons outside
   the influence of the dCDN, such as a malformed RI request.  To aid
   with diagnosing the cause of errors, RI responses SHOULD include an
   error dictionary to provide additional information to the uCDN as to
   the reason/cause of the error.  The intention behind the error
   dictionary is to aid with either manual or automatic diagnosis of
   issues.  The resolution of such issues is outside the scope of this
   document; this document does not specify any consequent actions a
   uCDN should take upon receiving a particular error-code.

   Error information (if present) is encoded as a set of key:value pairs
   within a JSON-encoded error dictionary as follows:

   +------------+---------+-----------+--------------------------------+
   | Key        | Value   | Mandatory | Description                    |

   The first digit of the error-code defines the class of error.  There
   are 5 classes of errors distinguished by the first digit of the
   error-code:

      1xx: Informational (no error): The response should not be
      considered an error by the uCDN, which may proceed by redirecting
      the UA according to the values in the RI response.  The error-code
      and accompanying description may be used for informational
      purposes, e.g., for logging.

      2xx: Reserved.

      3xx: Reserved.

      4xx: uCDN error: The dCDN cannot or will not process the request
      due to something that is perceived to be a uCDN error, for
      example, the RI request could not be parsed successfully by the
      dCDN.  The last two-digits may be used to more specifically
      indicate the source of the problem.

      5xx: dCDN error: Indicates that the dCDN is aware that it has
      erred or is incapable of satisfying the RI request for some
      reason, for example, the dCDN was able to parse the RI request but
      encountered an error for some reason.  Examples include the dCDN
      not being able to retrieve the associated metadata or the dCDN
      being out of capacity.

   The following error-codes are defined and maintained by IANA (see

   Error-codes with a "Reason" of "&lt;reason&gt;" do not have a defined value
   for their 'reason'-key.  Depending on the error-code semantics, the

   In order to prevent and detect RI request loops, each CDN MUST insert
   its CDN Provider ID into the cdn-path key of every RI request it
   originates or cascades.  When receiving RI requests, a dCDN MUST
   check the cdn-path and reject any RI requests that already contain
   the dCDN's Provider ID in the cdn-path.  Transit CDNs MUST NOT
   propagate to any downstream CDNs if the number of CDN Provider IDs in
   cdn-path (before adding its own Provider ID) is equal to or greater
   than max-hops.

   The CDN Provider ID uniquely identifies each CDN Provider during the
   course of request routing redirection.  It consists of the characters
   AS followed by the CDN Provider's AS number, then a colon (':') and
   an additional qualifier that is used to guarantee uniqueness in case
   a particular AS has multiple independent CDNs deployed; for example,
   "AS64496:0".

   If a dCDN receives an RI request whose cdn-path already contains that
   dCDN's Provider ID, the dCDN MUST send an RI error response that
   SHOULD include an error-code of 502.

   If a dCDN receives an RI request where the number of CDN Provider IDs
   in cdn-path is greater than max-hops, the dCDN MUST send an RI error
   response that SHOULD include an error-code of 503.

   It should be noted that the loop detection and prevention mechanisms
   described above only cover preventing and detecting loops within the
   RI itself.  Besides loops within the RI itself, there is also the
   possibility of loops in the data plane; for example, if the IP
   address(es) or URI(s) returned in RI responses do not resolve
   directly to a surrogate in the final dCDN, there is the possibility
   that a User Agent may be continuously redirected through a loop of
   CDNs.  The specification of solutions to address data-plane request
   redirection loops between CDNs is outside of the scope of this
   document.

   Information passed over the RI could be considered personal or
   sensitive, for example, RI requests contain parts of a User Agent's
   original request and RI responses reveal information about the dCDN's
   policy for which surrogates should serve which content/user
   locations.

   The RI interface also provides a mechanism whereby a uCDN could probe
   a dCDN and infer the dCDN's edge topology by making repeated RI
   requests for different content and/or UA IP addresses and correlating
   the responses from the dCDN.  Additionally, the ability for a dCDN to
   indicate that an RI response applies more widely than the original
   request (via the scope dictionary) may significantly reduce the
   number of RI requests required to probe and infer the dCDN's edge
   topology.

   The same information could be obtained in the absence of the RI
   interface, but it could be more difficult to gather as it would
   require a distributed set of machines with a range of different IP
   addresses, each making requests directly to the dCDN.  However, the
   RI facilitates easier collection of such information as it enables a
   single client to query the dCDN for a redirection/surrogate selection
   on behalf of any UA IP address.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Protection"></a>      Protection</span>

   An implementation of the CDNI Redirection interface MUST support TLS
   transport as per [<a href="rfc2818.html" title='"HTTP Over TLS"'>RFC2818</a>] and [<a href="rfc7230.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>].  The use of TLS for
   transport of the CDNI Redirection interface messages allows the dCDN
   and uCDN to authenticate each other.  Once they have mutually
   authenticated each other, it allows:

   o  The dCDN and uCDN to authorize each other (to ensure they are
      transmitting/receiving CDNI Redirection messages to/from an
      authorized CDN);

   o  CDNI Redirection interface messages to be transmitted with
      confidentiality; and

   o  The integrity of the CDNI Redirection interface messages to be
      protected during the exchange.

   In an environment where any such protection is required, mutually
   authenticated encrypted transport MUST be used to ensure
   confidentiality of the redirection information; to do so, TLS MUST be
   used (including authentication of the remote end) by the server side
   (dCDN) and the client side (uCDN) of the CDNI Redirection interface.

   When TLS is used, the general TLS usage guidance in [<a href="rfc7525.html" title='"Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)"'>RFC7525</a>] MUST be
   followed.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Privacy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Privacy</span>

   Information passed over the RI ought to be considered personal and
   sensitive.  In particular, parts of a User Agent's original request,
   most notably the UA's IP address and requested URI, are transmitted
   over the RI to the dCDN.  The use of mutually authenticated TLS, as
   described in the previous section, prevents any other party than the
   authorized dCDN from gaining access to this information.

   Regardless of whether the uCDN and dCDN use the RI, a successful
   redirect from a uCDN to a dCDN will make that dCDN aware of the UA's
   IP address.  As such, the fact that this information is transmitted
   across the RI does not allow the dCDN to learn new information.  On
   the other hand, if a uCDN uses the RI to check with multiple
   candidate dCDNs, those candidates that do not end up getting
   redirected to do obtain information regarding end-user IP addresses
   and requested URIs that they would not have if the RI not been used.

   While it is technically possible to mask some information in the RI
   Request, such as the last bits of the UA IP address, it is important
   to note that this will reduce the effectiveness of the RI in certain
   cases.  CDN deployments need to strike a balance between end-user
   privacy and the features impacted by such masking.  This balance is
   likely to vary from one deployment to another.  As an example, when
   the UA and its DNS resolver is behind a Carrier-grade NAT, and the RI
   is used to find an appropriate delivery node behind the same NAT, the
   full IP address might be necessary.  Another potential issue when
   using IP anonymization is that it is no longer possible to correlate
   an RI Request with a subsequent UA request.

   The Designated Expert will verify that new error-code registrations
   do not duplicate existing error-code definitions (in name or
   functionality), ensure that the new error-code is in accordance with
   the error classes defined in <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a> of this document, prevent
   gratuitous additions to the namespace, and prevent any additions to
   the namespace that would impair the interoperability of CDNI
   implementations.

   New registrations are required to provide the following information:

      Code: A three-digit numeric error-code, in accordance with the
      error classes defined in <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a> of this document.

      Reason: A string that provides further information related to the
      error that will be included in the JSON error dictionary with the
      'reason'-key.  Depending on the error-code semantics, the value of
      this field may be determined dynamically.  In that case, the
      registration should set this value to '&lt;reason&gt;' and define its
      semantics in the description field.

      Description: A brief description of the error-code semantics.

      Specification: Reference to the specification that defines the
      error-code in more detail.

   The entries in Table 8 are registered by this document, with the
   value of the 'Specification' field set to <a href="rfc7975.html">RFC 7975</a> (this document).
