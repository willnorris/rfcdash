Abstract

   This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating
   multiple bindings to the same resource.  Creating a new binding to a
   resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource.
   Servers are required to ensure the integrity of any bindings that
   they allow to be created.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This specification extends the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol
   ([<a href="rfc4918.html" title='"HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)"'>RFC4918</a>]) to enable clients to create new access paths to existing
   resources.  This capability is useful for several reasons:

   URIs of WebDAV-compliant resources are hierarchical and correspond to
   a hierarchy of collections in resource space.  The WebDAV Distributed
   Authoring Protocol makes it possible to organize these resources into
   hierarchies, placing them into groupings, known as collections, which
   are more easily browsed and manipulated than a single flat
   collection.  However, hierarchies require categorization decisions
   that locate resources at a single location in the hierarchy, a
   drawback when a resource has multiple valid categories.  For example,
   in a hierarchy of vehicle descriptions containing collections for
   cars and boats, a description of a combination car/boat vehicle could
   belong in either collection.  Ideally, the description should be
   accessible from both.  Allowing clients to create new URIs that
   access the existing resource lets them put that resource into
   multiple collections.

   Hierarchies also make resource sharing more difficult, since
   resources that have utility across many collections are still forced
   into a single collection.  For example, the mathematics department at
   one university might create a collection of information on fractals
   that contains bindings to some local resources but also provides
   access to some resources at other universities.  For many reasons, it
   may be undesirable to make physical copies of the shared resources on
   the local server, for example, to conserve disk space, to respect
   copyright constraints, or to make any changes in the shared resources
   visible automatically.  Being able to create new access paths to
   existing resources in other collections or even on other servers is
   useful for this sort of case.

   The BIND method, defined here, provides a mechanism for allowing
   clients to create alternative access paths to existing WebDAV
   resources.  HTTP [<a href="rfc2616.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>] and WebDAV [<a href="rfc4918.html" title='"HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)"'>RFC4918</a>] methods are able to
   work because there are mappings between URIs and resources.  A method
   is addressed to a URI, and the server follows the mapping from that
   URI to a resource, applying the method to that resource.  Multiple
   URIs may be mapped to the same resource, but until now, there has
   been no way for clients to create additional URIs mapped to existing
   resources.

   BIND lets clients associate a new URI with an existing WebDAV
   resource, and this URI can then be used to submit requests to the
   resource.  Since URIs of WebDAV resources are hierarchical, and
   correspond to a hierarchy of collections in resource space, the BIND

   method also has the effect of adding the resource to a collection.
   As new URIs are associated with the resource, it appears in
   additional collections.

   A BIND request does not create a new resource, but simply makes a new
   URI for submitting requests to an existing resource available.  The
   new URI is indistinguishable from any other URI when submitting a
   request to a resource.  Only one round trip is needed to submit a
   request to the intended target.  Servers are required to enforce the
   integrity of the relationships between the new URIs and the resources
   associated with them.  Consequently, it may be very costly for
   servers to support BIND requests that cross server boundaries.

   This specification is organized as follows.  <a href="#section-1.1">Section 1.1</a> defines
   terminology used in the rest of the specification, while <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>
   overviews bindings.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> defines the new properties needed to
   support multiple bindings to the same resource.  <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> specifies
   the BIND method, used to create multiple bindings to the same
   resource.  <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> specifies the UNBIND method, used to remove a
   binding to a resource.  <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> specifies the REBIND method, used
   to move a binding to another collection.

   The terminology used here follows and extends that in the WebDAV
   Distributed Authoring Protocol specification [<a href="rfc4918.html" title='"HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)"'>RFC4918</a>].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   This document uses XML DTD fragments ([<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)"'>XML</a>]) as a notational
   convention, using the rules defined in <a href="rfc4918.html#section-17">Section 17 of [RFC4918]</a>.

   URI Mapping

      A relation between an absolute URI and a resource.  For an
      absolute URI U and the resource it identifies R, the URI mapping
      can be thought of as (U =&gt; R).  Since a resource can represent
      items that are not network retrievable as well as those that are,
      it is possible for a resource to have zero, one, or many URI
      mappings.  Mapping a resource to an "http"-scheme URI makes it
      possible to submit HTTP requests to the resource using the URI.

   Path Segment

      Informally, the characters found between slashes ("/") in a URI.
      Formally, as defined in <a href="rfc3986.html#section-3.3">Section 3.3 of [RFC3986]</a>.

   Binding

      A relation between a single path segment (in a collection) and a
      resource.  A binding is part of the state of a collection.  If two
      different collections contain a binding between the same path
      segment and the same resource, these are two distinct bindings.
      So for a collection C, a path segment S, and a resource R, the
      binding can be thought of as C:(S -&gt; R).  Bindings create URI
      mappings, and hence allow requests to be sent to a single resource
      from multiple locations in a URI namespace.  For example, given a
      collection C (accessible through the URI
      http://www.example.com/CollX), a path segment S (equal to
      "foo.html"), and a resource R, then creating the binding C: (S -&gt;
      R) makes it possible to use the URI
      http://www.example.com/CollX/foo.html to access R.

   Collection

      A resource that contains, as part of its state, a set of bindings
      that identify internal member resources.

   Internal Member URI

      The URI that identifies an internal member of a collection and
      that consists of the URI for the collection, followed by a slash
      character ('/'), followed by the path segment of the binding for
      that internal member.

   Binding Integrity

      The property of a binding that says that:

      *  the binding continues to exist, and

      *  the identity of the resource identified by that binding does
         not change,

      unless an explicit request is executed that is defined to delete
      that binding (examples of requests that delete a binding are
      DELETE, MOVE, and -- defined later on -- UNBIND and REBIND).

   Bindings are part of the state of a collection.  They define the
   internal members of the collection and the names of those internal
   members.

   Bindings are added and removed by a variety of existing HTTP methods.
   A method that creates a new resource, such as PUT, COPY, and MKCOL,
   adds a binding.  A method that deletes a resource, such as DELETE,
   removes a binding.  A method that moves a resource (e.g., MOVE) both
   adds a binding (in the destination collection) and removes a binding
   (in the source collection).  The BIND method introduced here provides
   a mechanism for adding a second binding to an existing resource.
   There is no difference between an initial binding added by PUT, COPY,
   or MKCOL and additional bindings added with BIND.

   It would be very undesirable if one binding could be destroyed as a
   side effect of operating on the resource through a different binding.
   In particular, the removal of one binding to a resource (e.g., with a
   DELETE or a MOVE) MUST NOT disrupt another binding to that resource,
   e.g., by turning that binding into a dangling path segment.  The
   server MUST NOT reclaim system resources after removing one binding,
   while other bindings to the resource remain.  In other words, the
   server MUST maintain the integrity of a binding.  It is permissible,
   however, for future method definitions (e.g., a DESTROY method) to
   have semantics that explicitly remove all bindings and/or immediately
   reclaim system resources.

      Note: the collection model described herein is not compatible with
      systems in which resources inherit properties based solely on the
      access path, as the ability to create additional bindings will
      cause a single resource to appear as member of several different
      collections at the same time.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Bindings%20to%20Collections"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Bindings to Collections</span>

   Creating a new binding to a collection makes each resource associated
   with a binding in that collection accessible via a new URI, and thus
   creates new URI mappings to those resources but no new bindings.

   For example, suppose a new binding CollY is created for collection C1
   in the figure below.  It immediately becomes possible to access
   resource R1 using the URI /CollY/x.gif and to access resource R2
   using the URI /CollY/y.jpg, but no new bindings for these child
   resources were created.  This is because bindings are part of the
   state of a collection, and they associate a URI that is relative to

   that collection with its target resource.  No change to the bindings
   in Collection C1 is needed to make its children accessible using
   /CollY/x.gif and /CollY/y.jpg.

   Bindings to collections can result in loops ("cycles"), which servers
   MUST detect when processing "Depth: infinity" requests.  It is
   sometimes possible to complete an operation in spite of the presence
   of a loop.  For instance, a PROPFIND can still succeed if the server
   uses the new status code 208 (Already Reported) defined in
   <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>.

   However, the 508 (Loop Detected) status code is defined in
   <a href="#section-7.2">Section 7.2</a> for use in contexts where an operation is terminated
   because a loop was encountered.

   Support for loops is OPTIONAL: servers MAY reject requests that would
   lead to the creation of a bind loop (see DAV:cycle-allowed
   precondition defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20URI%20Mappings%20Created%20by%20a%20New%20Binding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  URI Mappings Created by a New Binding</span>

   Suppose a binding from "Binding-Name" to resource R is to be added to
   a collection, C.  Then if C-MAP is the set of URIs that were mapped
   to C before the BIND request, then for each URI "C-URI" in C-MAP, the
   URI "C-URI/Binding-Name" is mapped to resource R following the BIND
   request.

   For example, if a binding from "foo.html" to R is added to a
   collection C, and if the following URIs are mapped to C:

   http://www.example.com/A/1/
   http://example.com/A/one/

   then the following new mappings to R are introduced:

   http://www.example.com/A/1/foo.html
   http://example.com/A/one/foo.html

   Note that if R is a collection, additional URI mappings are created
   to the descendents of R.  Also, note that if a binding is made in
   collection C to C itself (or to a parent of C), an infinite number of
   mappings are introduced.

   For example, if a binding from "myself" to C is then added to C, the
   following infinite number of additional mappings to C are introduced:

   http://www.example.com/A/1/myself
   http://www.example.com/A/1/myself/myself
      ...

   and the following infinite number of additional mappings to R are
   introduced:

   http://www.example.com/A/1/myself/foo.html
   http://www.example.com/A/1/myself/myself/foo.html

   As defined in <a href="rfc4918.html#section-9.8">Section 9.8 of [RFC4918]</a>, COPY causes the resource
   identified by the Request-URI to be duplicated and makes the new
   resource accessible using the URI specified in the Destination
   header.  Upon successful completion of a COPY, a new binding is
   created between the last path segment of the Destination header and
   the destination resource.  The new binding is added to its parent
   collection, identified by the Destination header minus its final
   segment.

   The following figure shows an example: suppose that a COPY is issued
   to URI-3 for resource R (which is also mapped to URI-1 and URI-2),
   with the Destination header set to URI-X.  After successful
   completion of the COPY operation, resource R is duplicated to create
   resource R', and a new binding has been created that creates at least
   the URI mapping between URI-X and the new resource (although other
   URI mappings may also have been created).

     URI-1   URI-2    URI-3                           URI-X
        |       |        |                              |
        |       |        |   &lt;---- URI Mappings ----&gt;   |
        |       |        |                              |
     +---------------------+                 +------------------------+
     |     Resource R      |                 |     Resource R'        |
     +---------------------+                 +------------------------+

   It might be thought that a COPY request with "Depth: 0" on a
   collection would duplicate its bindings, since bindings are part of
   the collection's state.  This is not the case, however.  The
   definition of Depth in [<a href="rfc4918.html" title='"HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)"'>RFC4918</a>] makes it clear that a "Depth: 0"
   request does not apply to a collection's members.  Consequently, a
   COPY with "Depth: 0" does not duplicate the bindings contained by the
   collection.

   If a COPY request causes an existing resource to be updated, the
   bindings to that resource MUST be unaffected by the COPY request.
   Using the preceding example, suppose that a COPY request is issued to
   URI-X for resource R', with the Destination header set to URI-2.  The
   content and dead properties of resource R would be updated to be a
   copy of those of resource R', but the mappings from URI-1, URI-2, and
   URI-3 to resource R remain unaffected.  If, because of multiple
   bindings to a resource, more than one source resource updates a
   single destination resource, the order of the updates is server
   defined (see <a href="#section-2.3.2">Section 2.3.2</a> for an example).

   If a COPY request would cause a new resource to be created as a copy
   of an existing resource, and that COPY request has already created a
   copy of that existing resource, the COPY request instead creates
   another binding to the previous copy, instead of creating a new
   resource (see <a href="#section-2.3.3">Section 2.3.3</a> for an example).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.%20%20DELETE%20and%20Bindings"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" name="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  DELETE and Bindings</span>

   When there are multiple bindings to a resource, a DELETE applied to
   that resource MUST NOT remove any bindings to that resource other
   than the one identified by the Request-URI.  For example, suppose the
   collection identified by the URI "/a" has a binding named "x" to a
   resource R, and another collection identified by "/b" has a binding
   named "y" to the same resource R.  Then, a DELETE applied to "/a/x"
   removes the binding named "x" from "/a" but MUST NOT remove the
   binding named "y" from "/b" (i.e., after the DELETE, "/y/b" continues
   to identify the resource R).

   When DELETE is applied to a collection, it MUST NOT modify the
   membership of any other collection that is not itself a member of the
   collection being deleted.  For example, if both "/a/.../x" and
   "/b/.../y" identify the same collection, C, then applying DELETE to
   "/a" must not delete an internal member from C or from any other
   collection that is a member of C, because that would modify the
   membership of "/b".

   If a collection supports the UNBIND method (see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>), a DELETE
   of an internal member of a collection MAY be implemented as an UNBIND
   request.  In this case, applying DELETE to a Request-URI has the
   effect of removing the binding identified by the final segment of the
   Request-URI from the collection identified by the Request-URI minus
   its final segment.  Although [<a href="rfc4918.html" title='"HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)"'>RFC4918</a>] allows a DELETE to be a non-
   atomic operation, when the DELETE operation is implemented as an
   UNBIND, the operation is atomic.  In particular, a DELETE on a
   hierarchy of resources is simply the removal of a binding to the
   collection identified by the Request-URI.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.5.%20%20MOVE%20and%20Bindings"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5" name="section-2.5">2.5</a>.  MOVE and Bindings</span>

   When MOVE is applied to a resource, the other bindings to that
   resource MUST be unaffected; and if the resource being moved is a
   collection, the bindings to any members of that collection MUST be
   unaffected.  Also, if MOVE is used with Overwrite:T to delete an
   existing resource, the constraints specified for DELETE apply.

   If the destination collection of a MOVE request supports the REBIND
   method (see <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>), a MOVE of a resource into that collection MAY
   be implemented as a REBIND request.  Although [<a href="rfc4918.html" title='"HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)"'>RFC4918</a>] allows a MOVE
   to be a non-atomic operation, when the MOVE operation is implemented
   as a REBIND, the operation is atomic.  In particular, applying a MOVE
   to a Request-URI and a Destination URI has the effect of removing a
   binding to a resource (at the Request-URI) and creating a new binding

   to that resource (at the Destination URI).  Even when the Request-URI
   identifies a collection, the MOVE operation involves only removing
   one binding to that collection and adding another.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.5.1.%20%20Example%3A%20Simple%20MOVE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5.1" name="section-2.5.1">2.5.1</a>.  Example: Simple MOVE</span>

   As an example, suppose that a MOVE is issued to URI-3 for resource R
   below (which is also mapped to URI-1 and URI-2), with the Destination
   header set to URI-X.  After successful completion of the MOVE
   operation, a new binding has been created that creates the URI
   mapping between URI-X and resource R.  The binding corresponding to
   the final segment of URI-3 has been removed, which also causes the
   URI mapping between URI-3 and R to be removed.  If resource R were a
   collection, old URI-3-based mappings to members of R would have been
   removed, and new URI-X-based mappings to members of R would have been
   created.

   &gt;&gt; Before Request:

                URI-1   URI-2    URI-3

   Note that in the presence of collection bindings, a MOVE request can

   Consider the top-level collections C1 and C2 with URIs "/CollW/" and
   "/CollX/".  C1 also contains an additional binding named "CollY" to
   C2:

   Consistent with [<a href="rfc4918.html" title='"HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)"'>RFC4918</a>], the value of a dead property MUST be
   independent of the number of bindings to its host resource or of the
   path submitted to PROPFIND.  On the other hand, the behavior for each
   live property depends on its individual definition (for example, see
   <a href="rfc3744.html#section-5">[RFC3744], Section 5</a>, Paragraph 2 for a case where the value is
   independent of its path and bindings, and <a href="rfc4918.html#section-8.8">[RFC4918], Section 8.8</a> for
   a discussion about the live properties DAV:getetag and DAV:
   getlastmodified, which may behave differently).

   It is useful to have some way of determining whether two bindings are
   to the same resource.  Two resources might have identical contents
   and properties, but not be the same resource (e.g., an update to one
   resource does not affect the other resource).

   The REQUIRED DAV:resource-id property defined in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> is a
   resource identifier, which MUST be unique across all resources for
   all time.  If the values of DAV:resource-id returned by PROPFIND

   requests through two bindings are identical character by character,
   the client can be assured that the two bindings are to the same
   resource.

   The DAV:resource-id property is created, and its value assigned, when
   the resource is created.  The value of DAV:resource-id MUST NOT be
   changed.  Even after the resource is no longer accessible through any
   URI, that value MUST NOT be reassigned to another resource's DAV:
   resource-id property.

   Any method that creates a new resource MUST assign a new, unique
   value to its DAV:resource-id property.  For example, a PUT applied to
   a null resource, COPY (when not overwriting an existing target) and
   CHECKIN (see <a href="rfc3253.html#section-4.4">[RFC3253], Section 4.4</a>) must assign a new, unique value
   to the DAV:resource-id property of the new resource they create.

   On the other hand, any method that affects an existing resource must
   not change the value of its DAV:resource-id property.  Specifically,
   a PUT or a COPY that updates an existing resource must not change the
   value of its DAV:resource-id property.  A REBIND, since it does not
   create a new resource, but only changes the location of an existing
   resource, must not change the value of the DAV:resource-id property.

   An OPTIONAL DAV:parent-set property on a resource provides a list of
   the bindings that associate a collection and a URI segment with that
   resource.  If the DAV:parent-set property exists on a given resource,
   it MUST contain a complete list of all bindings to that resource that
   the client is authorized to see.  When deciding whether to support
   the DAV:parent-set property, server implementers / administrators
   should balance the benefits it provides against the cost of
   maintaining the property and the security risks enumerated in
   Sections <a href="#section-12.4">12.4</a> and <a href="#section-12.5">12.5</a>.

   The bind feature introduces the properties defined below.

   A DAV:allprop PROPFIND request SHOULD NOT return any of the
   properties defined by this document.  This allows a binding server to
   perform efficiently when a naive client, which does not understand
   the cost of asking a server to compute all possible live properties,
   issues a DAV:allprop PROPFIND request.

   The DAV:resource-id property is a REQUIRED property that enables
   clients to determine whether two bindings are to the same resource.
   The value of DAV:resource-id is a URI, and may use any registered URI
   scheme that guarantees the uniqueness of the value across all
   resources for all time (e.g., the urn:uuid: URN namespace defined in
   [<a href="rfc4122.html" title='"A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace"'>RFC4122</a>] or the opaquelocktoken: URI scheme defined in [<a href="rfc4918.html" title='"HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)"'>RFC4918</a>]).

   The DAV:parent-set property is an OPTIONAL property that enables
   clients to discover what collections contain a binding to this
   resource (i.e., what collections have that resource as an internal
   member).  It contains an href/segment pair for each collection that
   has a binding to the resource.  The href identifies the collection,
   and the segment identifies the binding name of that resource in that
   collection.

   A given collection MUST appear only once in the DAV:parent-set for
   any given binding, even if there are multiple URI mappings to that
   collection.

   For example, if collection C1 is mapped to both /CollX and /CollY,
   and C1 contains a binding named "x.gif" to a resource R1, then either
   [/CollX, x.gif] or [/CollY, x.gif] can appear in the DAV:parent-set
   of R1, but not both.  But if C1 also had a binding named "y.gif" to
   R1, then there would be two entries for C1 in the DAV:parent-set of
   R1 (i.e., both [/CollX, x.gif] and [/CollX, y.gif] or, alternatively,
   both [/CollY, x.gif] and [/CollY, y.gif]).

   The BIND method modifies the collection identified by the Request-
   URI, by adding a new binding from the segment specified in the BIND
   body to the resource identified in the BIND body.

   If a server cannot guarantee the integrity of the binding, the BIND
   request MUST fail.  Note that it is especially difficult to maintain
   the integrity of cross-server bindings.  Unless the server where the
   resource resides knows about all bindings on all servers to that
   resource, it may unwittingly destroy the resource or make it
   inaccessible without notifying another server that manages a binding
   to the resource.  For example, if server A permits the creation of a

   binding to a resource on server B, server A must notify server B
   about its binding and must have an agreement with B that B will not
   destroy the resource while A's binding exists.  Otherwise, server B
   may receive a DELETE request that it thinks removes the last binding
   to the resource and destroy the resource while A's binding still
   exists.  The precondition DAV:cross-server-binding is defined below
   for cases where servers fail cross-server BIND requests because they
   cannot guarantee the integrity of cross-server bindings.

   By default, if there already is a binding for the specified segment
   in the collection, the new binding replaces the existing binding.
   This default binding replacement behavior can be overridden using the
   Overwrite header defined in <a href="rfc4918.html#section-10.6">Section 10.6 of [RFC4918]</a>.

   If a BIND request fails, the server state preceding the request MUST
   be restored.  This method is unsafe and idempotent (see <a href="rfc2616.html#section-9.1">[RFC2616],
   Section 9.1</a>).

   Marshalling:

      The request MAY include an Overwrite header.

      The request body MUST be a DAV:bind XML element.

      &lt;!ELEMENT bind (segment, href)&gt;

      If the request succeeds, the server MUST return 201 (Created) when
      a new binding was created and 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) when an
      existing binding was replaced.

      If a response body for a successful request is included, it MUST
      be a DAV:bind-response XML element.  Note that this document does
      not define any elements for the BIND response body, but the DAV:
      bind-response element is defined to ensure interoperability
      between future extensions that do define elements for the BIND
      response body.

      &lt;!ELEMENT bind-response ANY&gt;

   Preconditions:

      (DAV:bind-into-collection): The Request-URI MUST identify a
      collection.

      (DAV:bind-source-exists): The DAV:href element MUST identify a
      resource.

      (DAV:binding-allowed): The resource identified by the DAV:href
      supports multiple bindings to it.

      (DAV:cross-server-binding): If the resource identified by the DAV:
      href element in the request body is on another server from the
      collection identified by the Request-URI, the server MUST support
      cross-server bindings (servers that do not support cross-server
      bindings can use this condition code to signal the client exactly
      why the request failed).

      (DAV:name-allowed): The name specified by the DAV:segment is
      available for use as a new binding name.

      (DAV:can-overwrite): If the collection already contains a binding

      included, the value of the Overwrite header MUST be "T".

      (DAV:cycle-allowed): If the DAV:href element identifies a
      collection, and if the Request-URI identifies a collection that is
      a member of that collection, the server MUST support cycles in the
      URI namespace (servers that do not support cycles can use this
      condition code to signal the client exactly why the request
      failed).

      (DAV:locked-update-allowed): If the collection identified by the
      Request-URI is write-locked, then the appropriate token MUST be
      specified in an If request header.

      (DAV:locked-overwrite-allowed): If the collection already contains
      a binding with the specified path segment, and if that binding is
      protected by a write lock, then the appropriate token MUST be
      specified in an If request header.

   Postconditions:

      the segment specified in the DAV:segment element in the request
      body to the resource identified by the DAV:href element in the

   &gt;&gt; Request:

   BIND /CollY HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   Content-Type: application/xml; charset="utf-8"
   Content-Length: 172

   &lt;/D:bind&gt;

   &gt;&gt; Response:

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Location: http://www.example.com/CollY/bar.html

   The server added a new binding to the collection,
   "http://www.example.com/CollY", associating "bar.html" with the
   resource identified by the URI
   "http://www.example.com/CollX/foo.html".  Clients can now use the URI
   "http://www.example.com/CollY/bar.html" to submit requests to that
   resource.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20UNBIND%20Method"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  UNBIND Method</span>

   The UNBIND method modifies the collection identified by the Request-
   URI by removing the binding identified by the segment specified in
   the UNBIND body.

   Once a resource is unreachable by any URI mapping, the server MAY
   reclaim system resources associated with that resource.  If UNBIND
   removes a binding to a resource, but there remain URI mappings to
   that resource, the server MUST NOT reclaim system resources
   associated with the resource.

   If an UNBIND request fails, the server state preceding the request
   MUST be restored.  This method is unsafe and idempotent (see
   <a href="rfc2616.html#section-9.1">[RFC2616], Section 9.1</a>).

   Marshalling:

      The request body MUST be a DAV:unbind XML element.

      If the request succeeds, the server MUST return 200 (OK) or 204
      (No Content) when the binding was successfully deleted.

      If a response body for a successful request is included, it MUST
      be a DAV:unbind-response XML element.  Note that this document
      does not define any elements for the UNBIND response body, but the
      DAV:unbind-response element is defined to ensure interoperability
      between future extensions that do define elements for the UNBIND
      response body.

      &lt;!ELEMENT unbind-response ANY&gt;

   Preconditions:

      (DAV:unbind-from-collection): The Request-URI MUST identify a
      collection.

      (DAV:unbind-source-exists): The DAV:segment element MUST identify
      a binding in the collection identified by the Request-URI.

      (DAV:locked-update-allowed): If the collection identified by the
      Request-URI is write-locked, then the appropriate token MUST be
      specified in the request.

      (DAV:protected-url-deletion-allowed): If the binding identified by
      the segment is protected by a write lock, then the appropriate
      token MUST be specified in the request.

   Postconditions:

      (DAV:binding-deleted): The collection MUST NOT have a binding for
      the segment specified in the DAV:segment element in the request
      body.

      (DAV:lock-deleted): If the internal member URI of the binding
      specified by the Request-URI and the DAV:segment element in the
      request body was protected by a write lock at the time of the
      request, that write lock must have been deleted by the request.

   &gt;&gt; Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK

   The server removed the binding named "foo.html" from the collection,
   "http://www.example.com/CollX".  A request to the resource named
   "http://www.example.com/CollX/foo.html" will return a 404 (Not Found)
   response.

   The REBIND method removes a binding to a resource from a collection,
   and adds a binding to that resource into the collection identified by
   the Request-URI.  The request body specifies the binding to be added
   (segment) and the old binding to be removed (href).  It is
   effectively an atomic form of a MOVE request, and MUST be treated the
   same way as MOVE for the purpose of determining access permissions.

   If a REBIND request fails, the server state preceding the request
   MUST be restored.  This method is unsafe and idempotent (see
   <a href="rfc2616.html#section-9.1">[RFC2616], Section 9.1</a>).

   Marshalling:

      The request MAY include an Overwrite header.

      The request body MUST be a DAV:rebind XML element.

      &lt;!ELEMENT rebind (segment, href)&gt;

      If the request succeeds, the server MUST return 201 (Created) when
      a new binding was created and 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) when an
      existing binding was replaced.

      &lt;!ELEMENT rebind-response ANY&gt;

   Preconditions:

      (DAV:rebind-into-collection): The Request-URI MUST identify a
      collection.

      (DAV:rebind-source-exists): The DAV:href element MUST identify a
      resource.

      (DAV:cross-server-binding): If the resource identified by the DAV:
      href element in the request body is on another server from the
      collection identified by the Request-URI, the server MUST support
      cross-server bindings (servers that do not support cross-server
      bindings can use this condition code to signal the client exactly
      why the request failed).

      (DAV:name-allowed): The name specified by the DAV:segment is
      available for use as a new binding name.

      (DAV:can-overwrite): If the collection already contains a binding
      with the specified path segment, and if an Overwrite header is
      included, the value of the Overwrite header MUST be "T".

      (DAV:cycle-allowed): If the DAV:href element identifies a
      collection, and if the Request-URI identifies a collection that is
      a member of that collection, the server MUST support cycles in the
      URI namespace (servers that do not support cycles can use this
      condition code to signal the client exactly why the request
      failed).

      (DAV:locked-update-allowed): If the collection identified by the
      Request-URI is write-locked, then the appropriate token MUST be
      specified in the request.

      (DAV:protected-url-modification-allowed): If the collection
      identified by the Request-URI already contains a binding with the
      specified path segment, and if that binding is protected by a
      write lock, then the appropriate token MUST be specified in the
      request.

      (DAV:protected-source-url-deletion-allowed): If the DAV:href URI
      is protected by a write lock, then the appropriate token MUST be

      the segment specified in the DAV:segment element in the request
      body, to the resource that was identified by the DAV:href element
      in the request body.

      (DAV:binding-deleted): The URL specified in the DAV:href element
      in the request body MUST NOT be mapped to a resource.

      (DAV:lock-deleted): If the URL specified in the DAV:href element
      in the request body was protected by a write lock at the time of
      the request, that write lock must have been deleted by the
      request.

   Note that the binding between CollZ and C1 creates a loop in the

   The 208 (Already Reported) status code can be used inside a DAV:
   propstat response element to avoid enumerating the internal members
   of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly.  For each
   binding to a collection inside the request's scope, only one will be
   reported with a 200 status, while subsequent DAV:response elements
   for all other bindings will use the 208 status, and no DAV:response
   elements for their descendants are included.

   Note that the 208 status will only occur for "Depth: infinity"
   requests, and that it is of particular importance when the multiple
   collection bindings cause a bind loop as discussed in <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>.

   A client can request the DAV:resource-id property in a PROPFIND
   request to guarantee that they can accurately reconstruct the binding
   structure of a collection with multiple bindings to a single
   resource.

   For backward compatibility with clients not aware of the 208 status
   code appearing in multistatus response bodies, it SHOULD NOT be used
   unless the client has signaled support for this specification using
   the "DAV" request header (see <a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>).  Instead, a 508 status
   should be returned when a binding loop is discovered.  This allows
   the server to return the 508 as the top-level return status, if it
   discovers it before it started the response, or in the middle of a
   multistatus, if it discovers it in the middle of streaming out a
   multistatus response.

   The 508 (Loop Detected) status code indicates that the server
   terminated an operation because it encountered an infinite loop while
   processing a request with "Depth: infinity".  This status indicates
   that the entire operation failed.

   If the server supports bindings, it MUST return the compliance class
   name "bind" as a field in the "DAV" response header (see <a href="rfc4918.html#section-10.1">[RFC4918],
   Section 10.1</a>) from an OPTIONS request on any resource implemented by

   Clients SHOULD signal support for all MUST-level requirements and

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20%20Relationship%20to%20Locking%20in%20WebDAV"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>.  Relationship to Locking in WebDAV</span>

   Locking is an optional feature of WebDAV ([<a href="rfc4918.html" title='"HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)"'>RFC4918</a>]).  The base
   WebDAV specification and this protocol extension have been designed
   in parallel, making sure that all features of WebDAV can be
   implemented on a server that implements this protocol as well.

   Unfortunately, WebDAV uses the term "lock-root" inconsistently.  It
   is introduced in <a href="rfc4918.html#section-6.1">Section 6.1 of [RFC4918]</a>, point 2, as:

      2.  A resource becomes directly locked when a LOCK request to a
      URL of that resource creates a new lock.  The "lock-root" of the
      new lock is that URL.  If at the time of the request, the URL is
      not mapped to a resource, a new empty resource is created and
      directly locked.

   On the other hand, <a href="rfc4918.html#section-9.10.1">[RFC4918], Section 9.10.1</a> states:

      A LOCK request to an existing resource will create a lock on the
      resource identified by the Request-URI, provided the resource is
      not already locked with a conflicting lock.  The resource
      identified in the Request-URI becomes the root of the lock.

   Servers that implement both WebDAV locking and support for multiple
   bindings MUST use the first interpretation: the lock-root is the URI
   through which the lock was created, not a resource.  This URI, and
   potential aliases of this URI (<a href="rfc4918.html#section-5">[RFC4918], Section 5</a>), are said to be
   "protected" by the lock.

   As defined in the introduction to <a href="rfc4918.html#section-7">Section 7 of [RFC4918]</a>, write
   operations that modify the state of a locked resource require that
   the lock token is submitted with the request.  Consistent with
   WebDAV, the state of the resource consists of the content ("any
   variant"), dead properties, lockable live properties (item 1), plus,
   for a collection, all its bindings (item 2).  Note that this, by
   definition, does not depend on the Request-URI to which the write
   operation is applied (the locked state is a property of the resource,
   not its URI).

   However, the lock-root is the URI through which the lock was
   requested.  Thus, the protection defined in item 3 of the list does
   not apply to additional URIs that may be mapped to the same resource
   due to the existence of multiple bindings.

   Consider a root collection "/", containing the two collections C1 and
   C2, named "/CollX" and "/CollY", and a child resource R, bound to C1
   as "/CollX/test" and bound to C2 as "/CollY/test":

                         +-------------------------+
                         | Root Collection         |
                         |  bindings:              |
                         |  CollX          CollY   |

                    +---------------+  +---------------+
                    | Collection C1 |  | Collection C2 |
                    | bindings:     |  | bindings:     |
                    |     test      |  |     test      |

                            +------------------+

   Given a host name of "www.example.com", applying a depth-zero write
   lock to "/CollX/test" will lock the resource R, and the lock-root of
   this lock will be "http://www.example.com/CollX/test".

   Thus, the following operations will require that the associated lock
   token is submitted with the "If" request header ([<a href="rfc4918.html" title='"HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)"'>RFC4918</a>], <a href="#section-10.4">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-10.4">10.4</a>):

   o  a PUT or PROPPATCH request modifying the content or lockable
      properties of resource R (as R is locked) -- no matter which URI
      is used as request target, and

   o  a MOVE, REBIND, UNBIND, or DELETE request causing "/CollX/test"
      not to be mapped to resource R anymore (be it addressed to
      "/CollX" or "/CollX/test").

   The following operations will not require submission of the lock
   token:

   o  a DELETE request addressed to "/CollY" or "/CollY/test", as it
      does not affect the resource R, nor the lock-root,

   o  for the same reason, an UNBIND request removing the binding "test"
      from collection C2, or the binding "CollY" from the root
      collection, and

   o  similarly, a MOVE or REBIND request causing "/CollY/test" not
      being mapped to resource R anymore.

   Note that despite the lock-root being
   "http://www.example.com/CollX/test", an UNLOCK request can be
   addressed through any URI mapped to resource R, as UNLOCK operates on
   the resource identified by the Request-URI, not that URI (see
   <a href="rfc4918.html#section-9.11">[RFC4918], Section 9.11</a>).

   Note that the WebDAV Access Control Protocol has been designed for
   compatibility with systems that allow multiple URIs to map to the
   same resource (see <a href="rfc3744.html#section-5">[RFC3744], Section 5</a>):

      Access control properties (especially DAV:acl and DAV:inherited-
      acl-set) are defined on the resource identified by the Request-URI
      of a PROPFIND request.  A direct consequence is that if the
      resource is accessible via multiple URI, the value of access
      control properties is the same across these URI.

   Furthermore, note that BIND and REBIND behave the same as MOVE with
   respect to the DAV:acl property (see <a href="rfc3744.html#section-7.3">[RFC3744], Section 7.3</a>).

   Servers that implement Workspaces (<a href="rfc3253.html#section-6">[RFC3253], Section 6</a>) and Version-
   Controlled Collections (<a href="rfc3253.html#section-14">[RFC3253], Section 14</a>) already need to
   implement BIND-like behavior in order to handle UPDATE and UNCHECKOUT
   semantics.

   Consider a workspace "/ws1/", containing the version-controlled,
   checked-out collections C1 and C2, named "/ws1/CollX" and "/ws1/
   CollY", and a version-controlled resource R, bound to C1 as "/ws1/
   CollX/test":

   The MOVE semantics defined in <a href="rfc3253.html#section-3.15">Section 3.15 of [RFC3253]</a> already
   require that "/ws1/CollX/test" and "/ws1/CollY/test" will have the
   same version history (as exposed in the DAV:version-history
   property).  Furthermore, the UNCHECKOUT semantics (which in this case
   is similar to UPDATE, see <a href="rfc3253.html#section-14.11">Section 14.11 of [RFC3253]</a>) require:

      If a new version-controlled member is in a workspace that already
      has a version-controlled resource for that version history, then
      the new version-controlled member MUST be just a binding (i.e.,
      another name for) that existing version-controlled resource.

   Thus, "/ws1/CollX/test" and "/ws1/CollY/test" will be bindings to the
   same resource R, and have identical DAV:resource-id properties.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5842.html">RFC 5842</a>              Binding Extensions to WebDAV            April 2010</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12" name="section-12">12</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This section is provided to make WebDAV implementers aware of the
   security implications of this protocol.

   All of the security considerations of HTTP/1.1 ([<a href="rfc2616.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>], <a href="#section-15">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-15">15</a>) and the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol specification
   (<a href="rfc4918.html#section-20">[RFC4918], Section 20</a>) also apply to this protocol specification.
   In addition, bindings introduce several new security concerns and
   increase the risk of some existing threats.  These issues are
   detailed below.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.1.%20%20Privacy%20Concerns"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.1" name="section-12.1">12.1</a>.  Privacy Concerns</span>

   In a context where cross-server bindings are supported, creating
   bindings on a trusted server may make it possible for a hostile agent
   to induce users to send private information to a target on a
   different server.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.2.%20%20Bind%20Loops"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.2" name="section-12.2">12.2</a>.  Bind Loops</span>

   Although bind loops were already possible in HTTP 1.1, the
   introduction of the BIND method creates a new avenue for clients to
   create loops accidentally or maliciously.  If the binding and its
   target are on the same server, the server may be able to detect BIND
   requests that would create loops.  Servers are required to detect
   loops that are caused by bindings to collections during the
   processing of any requests with "Depth: infinity".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.3.%20%20Bindings%20and%20Denial%20of%20Service"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.3" name="section-12.3">12.3</a>.  Bindings and Denial of Service</span>

   Denial-of-service attacks were already possible by posting URIs that
   were intended for limited use at heavily used Web sites.  The
   introduction of BIND creates a new avenue for similar denial-of-
   service attacks.  If cross-server bindings are supported, clients can
   now create bindings at heavily used sites to target locations that
   were not designed for heavy usage.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.4.%20%20Private%20Locations%20May%20Be%20Revealed"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.4" name="section-12.4">12.4</a>.  Private Locations May Be Revealed</span>

   If the DAV:parent-set property is maintained on a resource, the
   owners of the bindings risk revealing private locations.  The
   directory structures where bindings are located are available to
   anyone who has access to the DAV:parent-set property on the resource.
   Moving a binding may reveal its new location to anyone with access to
   DAV:parent-set on its resource.

   If the server maintains the DAV:parent-set property in response to
   bindings created in other administrative domains, it is exposed to
   hostile attempts to make it devote resources to adding bindings to
   the list.
