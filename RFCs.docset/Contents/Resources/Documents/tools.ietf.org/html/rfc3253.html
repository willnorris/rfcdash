Abstract

   This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types
   that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)
   versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.  WebDAV versioning
   will minimize the complexity of clients that are capable of
   interoperating with a variety of versioning repository managers, to
   facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of utilizing
   the WebDAV Versioning services.  WebDAV versioning includes automatic
   versioning for versioning-unaware clients, version history
   management, workspace management, baseline management, activity
   management, and URL namespace versioning.

   This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and properties
   that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)
   versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.  Versioning is
   concerned with tracking and accessing the history of important states
   of a web resource, such as a standalone web page.  The benefits of
   versioning in the context of the worldwide web include:

   -  A resource has an explicit history and a persistent identity
      across the various states it has had during the course of that
      history.  It allows browsing through past and alternative versions
      of a resource.  Frequently the modification and authorship history
      of a resource is critical information in itself.

   -  Resource states (versions) are given stable names that can support
      externally stored links for annotation and link server support.
      Both annotation and link servers frequently need to store stable
      references to portions of resources that are not under their
      direct control.  By providing stable states of resources, version
      control systems allow not only stable pointers into those
      resources, but also well defined methods to determine the
      relationships of those states of a resource.

   WebDAV Versioning defines both basic and advanced versioning
   functionality.

   Basic versioning allows users to:

   -  Put a resource under version control
   -  Determine whether a resource is under version control
   -  Determine whether a resource update will automatically be captured
      as a new version
   -  Create and access distinct versions of a resource

   Advanced versioning provides additional functionality for parallel
   development and configuration management of sets of web resources.

   This document will first define the properties and method semantics
   for the basic versioning features, and then define the additional
   properties and method semantics for the advanced versioning features.
   An implementer that is only interested in basic versioning should
   skip the advanced versioning sections (<a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> to <a href="#section-14">Section 14</a>).

   To maximize interoperability and the use of existing protocol
   functionality, versioning support is designed as extensions to the
   WebDAV protocol [<a href="rfc2518.html" title='"HTTP Extensions for Distributed Authoring - WEBDAV"'>RFC2518</a>], which itself is an extension to the HTTP
   protocol [<a href="rfc2616.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>].  All method marshalling and postconditions
   defined by <a href="rfc2518.html">RFC 2518</a> and <a href="rfc2616.html">RFC 2616</a> continue to hold, to ensure that
   versioning unaware clients can interoperate successfully with
   versioning servers.  Although the versioning extensions are designed
   to be orthogonal to most aspects of the WebDAV and HTTP protocols, a
   clarification to <a href="rfc2518.html">RFC 2518</a> is required for effective interoperable
   versioning.  This clarification is described in <a href="#section-1.7">Section 1.7</a>.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a>.

   The term "protected" is placed in parentheses following the
   definition of a protected property (see <a href="#section-1.4.2">Section 1.4.2</a>).

   The term "computed" is placed in parentheses following the definition
   of a computed property (see <a href="#section-1.4.3">Section 1.4.3</a>).

   When an XML element type in the "DAV:" namespace is referenced in
   this document outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string
   "DAV:" will be prefixed to the element type.

   When a method is defined in this document, a list of preconditions
   and postconditions will be defined for that method.  If the semantics
   of an existing method is being extended, a list of additional
   preconditions and postconditions will be defined.  A precondition or

   This document uses the terms defined in <a href="rfc2616.html">RFC 2616</a>, in <a href="rfc2518.html">RFC 2518</a>, and in
   this section.  <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a> defines the semantic versioning model
   underlying this terminology.

   Version Control, Checked-In, Checked-Out

      "Version control" is a set of constraints on how a resource can be
      updated.  A resource under version control is either in a
      "checked-in" or "checked-out" state, and the version control
      constraints apply only while the resource is in the checked-in
      state.

   Versionable Resource

      A "versionable resource" is a resource that can be put under
      version control.

   Version-Controlled Resource

      When a versionable resource is put under version control, it
      becomes a "version-controlled resource".  A version-controlled
      resource can be "checked out" to allow modification of its content
      or dead properties by standard HTTP and WebDAV methods.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3253.html">RFC 3253</a>            Versioning Extensions to WebDAV           March 2002</span>


   Checked-Out Resource

      A "checked-out resource" is a resource under version control that
      is in the checked-out state.

   Version Resource

      A "version resource", or simply "version", is a resource that
      contains a copy of a particular state (content and dead
      properties) of a version-controlled resource.  A version is
      created by "checking in" a checked-out resource.  The server
      allocates a distinct new URL for each new version, and this URL
      will never be used to identify any resource other than that
      version.  The content and dead properties of a version never
      change.

   Version History Resource

      A "version history resource", or simply "version history", is a
      resource that contains all the versions of a particular version-
      controlled resource.

   Version Name

      A "version name" is a string chosen by the server to distinguish
      one version of a version history from the other versions of that
      version history.  Versions from different version histories may
      have the same version name.

   Predecessor, Successor, Ancestor, Descendant

      When a version-controlled resource is checked out and then
      subsequently checked in, the version that was checked out becomes
      a "predecessor" of the version created by the checkin.  A client
      can specify multiple predecessors for a new version if the new
      version is logically a merge of those predecessors.  When a
      version is connected to another version by traversing one or more
      predecessor relations, it is called an "ancestor" of that version.
      The inverse of the predecessor and ancestor relations are the
      "successor" and "descendant" relations.  Therefore, if X is a
      predecessor of Y, then Y is a successor of X, and if X is an
      ancestor of Y, then Y is a descendant of X.

   Root Version Resource

      The "root version resource", or simply "root version", is the
      version in a version history that is an ancestor of every other
      version in that version history.

   Workspace Resource

      A "workspace resource", or simply "workspace", is a collection
      that contains at most one version-controlled resource for a given
      version history (see <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>).

   Working Resource

      A "working resource" is a checked-out resource created by the
      server at a server-defined URL when a version (instead of a
      version-controlled resource) is checked out.  Unlike a checked-out
      version-controlled resource, a working resource is deleted when it
      is checked in.

   Fork, Merge

      When a second successor is added to a version, this creates a
      "fork" in the version history.  When a version is created with
      multiple predecessors, this creates a "merge" in the version
      history.  A server may restrict the version history to be linear
      (with no forks or merges), but an interoperable versioning client
      should be prepared to deal with both forks and merges in the
      version history.

   The following diagram illustrates several of the previous
   definitions.  Each box represents a version and each line between two
   boxes represents a predecessor/successor relationship.  For example,
   it shows V3 is a predecessor of V5, V7 is a successor of V5, V1 is an
   ancestor of V4, and V7 is a descendant of V4.  It also shows that
   there is a fork at version V2 and a merge at version V7.

   Label

      A "label" is a name that can be used to select a version from a
      version history.  A label can be assigned by either a client or
      the server.  The same label can be used in different version
      histories.

   When a property of a specific kind of resource is "protected", the
   property value cannot be updated on that kind of resource except by a
   method explicitly defined as updating that specific property.  In
   particular, a protected property cannot be updated with a PROPPATCH
   request.  Note that a given property can be protected on one kind of
   resource, but not protected on another kind of resource.

   When a property is "computed", its value is defined in terms of a
   computation based on the content and other properties of that
   resource, or even of some other resource.  When the semantics of a
   method is defined in this document, the effect of that method on
   non-computed properties will be specified; the effect of that method
   on computed properties will not be specified, but can be inferred
   from the computation defined for those properties.  A computed
   property is always a protected property.

   Although WebDAV request and response bodies can be extended by
   arbitrary XML elements, which can be ignored by the message
   recipient, an XML element in the DAV namespace MUST NOT be used in
   the request or response body of a versioning method unless that XML
   element is explicitly defined in an IETF RFC.

   A "precondition" of a method describes the state of the server that
   must be true for that method to be performed.  A "postcondition" of a
   method describes the state of the server that must be true after that
   method has been completed.  If a method precondition or postcondition
   for a request is not satisfied, the response status of the request
   MUST be either 403 (Forbidden) if the request should not be repeated
   because it will always fail, or 409 (Conflict) if it is expected that
   the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the
   request.

   In order to allow better client handling of 403 and 409 responses, a
   distinct XML element type is associated with each method precondition
   and postcondition of a request.  When a particular precondition is
   not satisfied or a particular postcondition cannot be achieved, the
   appropriate XML element MUST be returned as the child of a top-level
   DAV:error element in the response body, unless otherwise negotiated
   by the request.  In a 207 Multi-Status response, the DAV:error
   element would appear in the appropriate DAV:responsedescription
   element.

   "If a resource exists at the destination and the Overwrite header is
   "T" then prior to performing the copy the server MUST perform a
   DELETE with "Depth: infinity" on the destination resource."

   The purpose of this sentence is to ensure that following a COPY, all
   destination resources have the same content and dead properties as
   the corresponding resources identified by the request-URL (where a
   resource with a given name relative to the Destination URL
   "corresponds" to a resource with the same name relative to the
   request-URL).  If at the time of the request, there already is a
   resource at the destination that has the same resource type as the
   corresponding resource at the request-URL, that resource MUST NOT be
   deleted, but MUST be updated to have the content and dead properties

   of its corresponding member.  If a client wishes all resources at the
   destination to be deleted prior to the COPY, it MUST explicitly issue
   a DELETE request.

   The difference between updating a resource and replacing a resource
   with a new resource is especially important when resource history is
   being maintained (the former adds to an existing history, while the
   latter creates a new history).  In addition, locking and access
   control constraints might allow you to update a resource, but not
   allow you to delete it and create a new one in its place.

   Note that this clarification does not apply to a MOVE request.  A
   MOVE request with Overwrite:T MUST perform the DELETE with
   "Depth:infinity" on the destination resource prior to performing the
   MOVE.

   If a write-locked resource has a non-computed property defined by
   this document, the property value MUST NOT be changed by a request
   unless the appropriate lock token is included in the request.  Since

   A server MAY support any combination of versioning features.
   However, in order to minimize the complexity of a WebDAV basic
   versioning client, a WebDAV basic versioning server SHOULD support
   one of the following three "packages" (feature sets):

   -  Core-Versioning Package: version-control
   -  Basic-Server-Workspace Package: version-control, workspace,
      version-history, checkout
   -  Basic-Client-Workspace Package: version-control, working-
      resource, update, label

   The core-versioning package supports linear versioning by both
   versioning-aware and versioning-unaware clients.  A versioning-aware
   client can use reports and properties to access previous versions of
   a version-controlled resource.

   The basic workspace packages support parallel development of
   version-controlled resources.  Each client has its own configuration
   of the shared version-controlled resources, and can make changes to
   its configuration without disturbing that of another client.

   In the basic-server-workspace package, all persistent state is
   maintained on the server.  Each client has its own workspace resource
   allocated on the server, where each workspace identifies a
   configuration of the shared version-controlled resources.  Each
   client makes changes to its workspace, and can transfer changes when
   appropriate from one workspace to another.  The server workspace
   package is appropriate for clients with no local persistent state, or
   for clients that wish to expose their working configurations to other
   clients.

   In the basic-client-workspace package, each client maintains in local
   persistent storage the state for its configuration of the shared
   version-controlled resources.  When a client is ready to make its
   changes visible to other clients, it allocates a set of "working
   resources" on the server, updates the content and dead properties of
   these working resources, and then uses the set of working resources
   to update the version-controlled resources.  The working resources
   are used, instead of directly updating the version-controlled
   resources, so that sets of consistent updates can be prepared in
   parallel by multiple clients.  Also, a working resource allows a
   client to prepare a single update that requires multiple server
   requests (e.g. updating both the content and dead properties of a
   resource requires both a PUT and a PROPPATCH).  The client workspace
   package simplifies the server implementation by requiring each client
   to maintain its own namespace, but this requires that the clients
   have local persistent state, and does not allow clients to expose
   their working configurations to other clients.

   A server that supports both basic workspace packages will
   interoperate with all basic versioning clients.

   In order to track the history of the content and dead properties of a
   versionable resource, a user can put the resource under version
   control with a VERSION-CONTROL request.  A VERSION-CONTROL request
   performs three distinct operations:

   1) It creates a new "version history resource".  In basic versioning,
      a version history resource is not assigned a URL, and hence is not
      visible in the http scheme URL space.  However, when the version-
      history feature (see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>) is supported, this changes, and
      each version history resource is assigned a new distinct and
      unique server-defined URL.

   2) It creates a new "version resource" and adds it to the new version
      history resource.  The body and dead properties of the new version
      resource are a copy of those of the versionable resource.

      The server assigns the new version resource a new distinct and
      unique URL.

   3) It converts the versionable resource into a "version-controlled
      resource".  The version-controlled resource continues to be
      identified by the same URL that identified it as a versionable
      resource.  As part of this conversion, it adds a DAV:checked-in
      property, whose value contains the URL of the new version
      resource.

   Note that a versionable resource and a version-controlled resource
   are not new types of resources (i.e. they introduce no new
   DAV:resourcetype), but rather they are any type of resource that
   supports the methods and live properties defined for them in this
   document, in addition to all the methods and live properties implied
   by their DAV:resourcetype.  For example, a collection (whose
   DAV:resourcetype is DAV:collection) is a versionable resource if it
   supports the VERSION-CONTROL method, and is a version-controlled
   resource if it supports the version-controlled resource methods and
   live properties.

   In the following example, foo.html is a versionable resource that is
   put under version control.  After the VERSION-CONTROL request
   succeeds, there are two additional resources: a new version history
   resource and a new version resource in that version history.  The
   versionable resource is converted into a version-controlled resource,
   whose DAV:checked-in property identifies the new version resource.

   The content and dead properties of a resource are represented by the
   symbol appearing inside the box for that resource (e.g., "S1" in the
   following example).

            ===VERSION-CONTROL==&gt;

                      |                       +----+ version
                      |   version-            |    | history
         versionable  |   controlled          +----+ resource
         resource     |   resource              |

           +----+     |     +----+            +----+ /his/73/ver/1

   Thus, whereas before the VERSION-CONTROL request there was only one,
   non-version-controlled resource, after VERSION-CONTROL there are
   three separate, distinct resources, each containing its own state and
   properties: the version-controlled resource, the version resource,
   and the version history resource.  Since the version-controlled
   resource and the version resource are separate, distinct resources,
   when a method is applied to a version-controlled resource, it is only
   applied to that version-controlled resource, and is not applied to
   the version resource that is currently identified by the
   DAV:checked-in property of that version-controlled resource.
   Although the content and dead properties of a checked-in version-
   controlled resource are required to be the same as those of its
   current DAV:checked-in version, its live properties may differ.  An
   implementation may optimize storage by retrieving the content and
   dead properties of a checked-in version-controlled resource from its
   current DAV:checked-in version rather than storing them in the
   version-controlled resource, but this is just an implementation
   optimization.

   Normally, a resource is placed under version control with an explicit
   VERSION-CONTROL request.  A server MAY automatically place every new
   versionable resource under version control.  In this case, the
   resulting state on the server MUST be the same as if the client had
   explicitly applied a VERSION-CONTROL request to the versionable
   resource.

   In order to use methods like PUT and PROPPATCH to directly modify the
   content or dead properties of a version-controlled resource, the
   version-controlled resource must first be checked out.  When the
   checked-out resource is checked in, a new version is created in the

   version history of that version-controlled resource.  The version
   that was checked out is remembered as the predecessor of the new
   version.

   The DAV:auto-version property (see Sections <a href="#section-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>) of a checked-in
   version-controlled resource determines how it responds to a method
   that attempts to modify its content or dead properties.  Possible
   responses include:

   -  Fail the request.  The resource requires an explicit CHECKOUT
      request for it to be modified (see Sections <a href="#section-4">4</a> and <a href="#section-9.2.1">9.2.1</a>).

   -  Automatically checkout the resource, perform the modification, and
      automatically checkin the resource.  This ensures that every state
      of the resource is tracked by the server, but can result in an
      excessive number of versions being created.

   -  Automatically checkout the resource, perform the modification, and
      then if the resource is not write-locked, automatically checkin
      the resource.  If the resource is write-locked, it remains
      checked-out until the write-lock is removed (either explicitly
      through a subsequent UNLOCK request or implicitly through a time-
      out of the write-lock).  This helps a locking client avoid the
      proliferation of versions, while still allowing a non-locking
      client to update the resource.

   -  Automatically checkout the resource, perform the modification, and
      then leave the resource checked out.  If the resource is write-
      locked, it will be automatically checked in when the write-lock is
      removed, but an explicit CHECKIN operation (see <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>) is
      required for a non-write-locked resource.  This minimizes the
      number of new versions that will be created by a versioning
      unaware client, but only a versioning aware client can create new
      versions of a non-write-locked resource.

   -  Fail the request unless the resource is write-locked.  If it is
      write-locked, automatically checkout the resource and perform the
      modification.  The resource is automatically checked in when the
      write-lock is removed.  This minimizes the number of new versions
      that will be created by a versioning unaware client, but never
      automatically checks out a resource that will not subsequently be
      automatically checked in.

   Note that a version captures only a defined subset of the state of a
   resource.  In particular, a version of a basic resource captures its
   content and dead properties, but not its live properties.

   Some versioning information about a resource requires that parameters
   be specified along with that request for information.  Included in
   basic versioning is the required support for an extensible reporting
   mechanism, which includes a REPORT method as well as a live property
   for determining what reports are supported by a particular resource.
   The REPORT method is required by versioning, but it can be used in
   non-versioning WebDAV extensions.

   To allow a client to query the properties of all versions in the

   versioning provides the DAV:version-tree report (see <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>).  A

   applying the DAV:expand-property report (see <a href="#section-3.8">Section 3.8</a>) to a

   If the DAV:auto-version value is DAV:checkout, when a modification
   request is applied to a checked-in version-controlled resource, the
   request is automatically preceded by a checkout operation.

   If the DAV:auto-version value is DAV:locked-checkout, when a
   modification request is applied to a write-locked checked-in
   version-controlled resource, the request is automatically preceded by
   a checkout operation.

   If an update to a write-locked checked-in resource is automatically
   preceded by a checkout of that resource, the checkout is associated
   with the write lock.  When this write lock is removed (e.g. from an
   UNLOCK or a lock timeout), if the resource has not yet been checked
   in, the removal of the write lock is automatically preceded by a
   checkin operation.

   A server MAY refuse to allow the value of the DAV:auto-version
   property to be modified, or MAY only support values from a subset of
   the valid values.

   A VERSION-CONTROL request can be used to create a version-controlled
   resource at the request-URL.  It can be applied to a versionable
   resource or to a version-controlled resource.

   If the request-URL identifies a versionable resource, a new version
   history resource is created, a new version is created whose content
   and dead properties are copied from the versionable resource, and the
   resource is given a DAV:checked-in property that is initialized to
   identify this new version.

   If the request-URL identifies a version-controlled resource, the
   resource just remains under version-control.  This allows a client to
   be unaware of whether or not a server automatically puts a resource
   under version control when it is created.

   If a VERSION-CONTROL request fails, the server state preceding the
   request MUST be restored.

   Marshalling:

      If a request body is included, it MUST be a DAV:version-control
      XML element.

      &lt;!ELEMENT version-control ANY&gt;

      If a response body for a successful request is included, it MUST
      be a DAV:version-control-response XML element.  Note that this
      document does not define any elements for the VERSION-CONTROL
      response body, but the DAV:version-control-response element is
      defined to ensure interoperability between future extensions that
      do define elements for the VERSION-CONTROL response body.

   Postconditions:

      (DAV:put-under-version-control): If the request-URL identified a
      versionable resource at the time of the request, the request MUST
      have created a new version history and MUST have created a new
      version resource in that version history.  The resource MUST have
      a DAV:checked-in property that identifies the new version.  The
      content, dead properties, and DAV:resourcetype of the new version
      MUST be the same as those of the resource.  Note that an
      implementation can choose to locate the version history and
      version resources anywhere that it wishes.  In particular, it
      could locate them on the same host and server as the version-
      controlled resource, on a different virtual host maintained by the
      same server, on the same host maintained by a different server, or
      on a different host maintained by a different server.

      (DAV:must-not-change-existing-checked-in-out): If the request-URL
      identified a resource already under version control at the time of
      the request, the request MUST NOT change the DAV:checked-in or
      DAV:checked-out property of that version-controlled resource.

   In this example, /foo.html is put under version control.  A new

   A REPORT request is an extensible mechanism for obtaining information
   about a resource.  Unlike a resource property, which has a single
   value, the value of a report can depend on additional information
   specified in the REPORT request body and in the REPORT request
   headers.

   Marshalling:

      The body of a REPORT request specifies which report is being
      requested, as well as any additional information that will be used
      to customize the report.

      The request MAY include a Depth header.  If no Depth header is
      included, Depth:0 is assumed.

      The response body for a successful request MUST contain the
      requested report.

      If a Depth request header is included, the response MUST be a 207
      Multi-Status.  The request MUST be applied separately to the
      collection itself and to all members of the collection that
      satisfy the Depth value.  The DAV:prop element of a DAV:response
      for a given resource MUST contain the requested report for that
      resource.

   Preconditions:

      (DAV:supported-report): The specified report MUST be supported by
      the resource identified by the request-URL.

   Postconditions:

      (DAV:no-modification): The REPORT method MUST NOT have changed the
      content or dead properties of any resource.

   Many property values are defined as a DAV:href, or a set of DAV:href
   elements.  The DAV:expand-property report provides a mechanism for
   retrieving in one request the properties from the resources
   identified by those DAV:href elements.  This report not only
   decreases the number of requests required, but also allows the server
   to minimize the number of separate read transactions required on the
   underlying versioning store.

   The DAV:expand-property report SHOULD be supported by all resources
   that support the REPORT method.

   Marshalling:

      The request body MUST be a DAV:expand-property XML element.

      &lt;!ELEMENT expand-property (property*)&gt;
      &lt;!ELEMENT property (property*)&gt;
      &lt;!ATTLIST property name NMTOKEN #REQUIRED&gt;
      name value: a property element type
      &lt;!ATTLIST property namespace NMTOKEN "DAV:"&gt;
      namespace value: an XML namespace

      The response body for a successful request MUST be a
      DAV:multistatus XML element.

      multistatus: see <a href="rfc2518.html#section-12.9">RFC 2518, Section 12.9</a>

      The properties reported in the DAV:prop elements of the
      DAV:multistatus element MUST be those identified by the
      DAV:property elements in the DAV:expand-property element.  If
      there are DAV:property elements nested within a DAV:property
      element, then every DAV:href in the value of the corresponding
      property is replaced by a DAV:response element whose DAV:prop
      elements report the values of the properties identified by the
      nested DAV:property elements.  The nested DAV:property elements
      can in turn contain DAV:property elements, so that multiple levels
      of DAV:href expansion can be requested.

      Note that a validating parser MUST be aware that the DAV:expand-
      property report effectively modifies the DTD of every property by
      replacing every occurrence of "href" in the DTD with "href |
      response".

      If the request creates a new resource that is automatically placed
      under version control, all preconditions for VERSION-CONTROL apply
      to the request.

   Additional Postconditions:

      (DAV:auto-checkout): If the resource was a checked-in version-
      controlled resource whose DAV:auto-version property indicates it
      should be automatically checked out but not automatically checked
      in for a modification request, then the server MUST have
      automatically checked out the resource prior to executing the
      request.  In particular, the value of the DAV:checked-out property
      of the resource MUST be that of the DAV:checked-in property prior
      to the request, the DAV:checked-in property MUST have been
      removed, and the DAV:predecessor-set property MUST be initialized
      to be the same as the DAV:checked-out property.  If any part of
      the checkout/update sequence failed, the status from the failed
      part of the request MUST be returned, and the server state
      preceding the request sequence MUST be restored.

      (DAV:auto-checkout-checkin): If the resource was a checked-in
      version-controlled resource whose DAV:auto-version property
      indicates it should be automatically checked out and automatically
      checked in for a modification request, then the server MUST have
      automatically checked out the resource prior to executing the
      request and automatically checked it in after the request.  In
      particular, the DAV:checked-in property of the resource MUST
      identify a new version whose content and dead properties are the
      same as those of the resource.  The DAV:predecessor-set of the new
      version MUST identify the version identified by the DAV:checked-in
      property prior to the request.  If any part of the
      checkout/update/checkin sequence failed, the status from the
      failed part of the request MUST be returned, and the server state
      preceding the request sequence MUST be restored.

      If the request creates a new resource, the new resource MAY have
      automatically been placed under version control, and all
      postconditions for VERSION-CONTROL apply to the request.

   A DAV:allprop PROPFIND request SHOULD NOT return any of the

      attempts to modify a dead property, same semantics as PUT (see

      (DAV:cannot-modify-protected-property): An attempt to modify a
      property that is defined by this document, as being protected for
      that kind of resource, MUST fail.

      (DAV:supported-live-property): An attempt to modify a property
      defined by this document, but whose semantics are not enforced by
      the server, MUST fail.  This helps ensure that a client will be
      notified when it is trying to use a property whose semantics are

   Additional Postconditions:

      (DAV:auto-checkout): If the request modified a dead property, same
      semantics as PUT (see <a href="#section-3.10">Section 3.10</a>).

   Additional Preconditions:

      If the request creates a new resource that is automatically placed
      under version control, all preconditions for VERSION-CONTROL apply
      to the request.

   Additional Postconditions:

      (DAV:must-not-copy-versioning-property): A property defined by
      this document MUST NOT have been copied to the new resource
      created by this request, but instead that property of the new
      resource MUST have the default initial value it would have had if
      the new resource had been created by a non-versioning method such
      as PUT or a MKCOL.

      (DAV:auto-checkout): If the destination is a version-controlled
      resource, same semantics as PUT (see <a href="#section-3.10">Section 3.10</a>).

      (DAV:auto-checkout-checkin): If the destination is a version-
      controlled resource, same semantics as PUT (see <a href="#section-3.10">Section 3.10</a>).

      (DAV:copy-creates-new-resource): If the source of a COPY is a
      version-controlled resource or version, and if there is no
      resource at the destination of the COPY, then the COPY creates a
      new non-version-controlled resource at the destination of the
      COPY.  The new resource MAY automatically be put under version
      control, but the resulting version-controlled resource MUST be
      associated with a new version history created for that new
      version-controlled resource, and all postconditions for
      VERSION-CONTROL apply to the request.

      from a source URL to a destination URL, a property defined by this
      document MUST have the same value at the destination URL as it had
      at the source URL.

   Note that these semantics apply both to an explicit UNLOCK request,
   as well as to the removal of a lock because of a lock timeout.  If a
   precondition or postcondition cannot be satisfied, the lock timeout
   MUST NOT occur.

   Additional Preconditions:

      (DAV:version-history-is-tree): If the request-URL identifies a
      checked-out version-controlled resource that will be automatically
      checked in when the lock is removed, then the versions identified
      by the DAV:predecessor-set of the checked-out resource MUST be
      descendants of the root version of the version history for the
      DAV:checked-out version.

   Additional Postconditions:

      (DAV:auto-checkin): If the request-URL identified a checked-out
      version-controlled resource that had been automatically checked
      out because of its DAV:auto-version property, the request MUST
      have created a new version in the version history of the
      DAV:checked-out version.  The request MUST have allocated a URL
      for the version that MUST NOT have previously identified any other
      resource, and MUST NOT ever identify a resource other than this
      version.  The content, dead properties, DAV:resourcetype, and
      DAV:predecessor-set of the new version MUST be copied from the
      checked-out resource.  The DAV:version-name of the new version
      MUST be set to a server-defined value distinct from all other
      DAV:version-name values of other versions in the same version
      history.  The request MUST have removed the DAV:checked-out
      property of the version-controlled resource, and MUST have added a
      DAV:checked-in property that identifies the new version.

   With the version-control feature, WebDAV locking can be used to avoid
   the proliferation of versions that would result if every modification
   to a version-controlled resource produced a new version.  The
   checkout-in-place feature provides an alternative mechanism that
   allows a client to explicitly check out and check in a resource to
   create a new version.

   If a server supports the checkout-in-place feature, it MUST include

   It is often useful to have access to a version history even after all
   version-controlled resources for that version history have been
   deleted.  A server can provide this functionality by supporting
   version history resources.  A version history resource is a resource
   that exists in a server defined namespace and therefore is unaffected
   by any deletion or movement of version-controlled resources.  A
   version history resource is an appropriate place to add a property
   that logically applies to all states of a resource.  The DAV:expand-
   property report (see <a href="#section-3.8">Section 3.8</a>) can be applied to the DAV:version-
   set of a version history resource to provide a variety of useful
   reports on all versions in that version history.

   Many properties identify a version from some version history.  It is
   often useful to be able to efficiently locate a version-controlled

   can be applied to a collection to locate the collection member that
   is a version-controlled resource for a specified version history
   resource.

   In order to allow multiple users to work concurrently on adding
   versions to the same version history, it is necessary to allocate on
   the server multiple checked-out resources for the same version
   history.  Even if only one user is making changes to a resource, that
   user will sometimes wish to create a "private" version, and then to
   expose that version at a later time.  One way to provide this
   functionality depends on the client keeping track of its current set
   of checked-out resources.  This is the working-resource feature
   defined in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.  The other way to provide this functionality
   avoids the need for persistent state on the client, and instead has
   the server maintain a human meaningful namespace for related sets of
   checked-out resources.  This is the workspace feature defined in this
   section.

   The workspace feature introduces a "workspace resource".  A workspace
   resource is a collection whose members are related version-controlled
   and non-version-controlled resources.  Multiple workspaces may be
   used to expose different versions and configurations of a set of
   version-controlled resources concurrently.  In order to make changes
   to a version-controlled resource in one workspace visible in another
   workspace, that version-controlled resource must be checked in, and
   then the corresponding version-controlled resource in the other
   workspace can be updated to display the content and dead properties
   of the new version.

   In order to ensure unambiguous merging (see <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>) and
   baselining (see <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>) semantics, a workspace may contain at
   most one version-controlled resource for a given version history.
   This is required for unambiguous merging because the MERGE method
   must identify which version-controlled resource is to be the merge
   target of a given version.  This is required for unambiguous
   baselining because a baseline can only select one version for a given
   version-controlled resource.

   Initially, an empty workspace can be created.  Non-version-controlled
   resources can then be added to the workspace with standard WebDAV
   requests such as PUT and MKCOL.  Version-controlled resources can be
   added to the workspace with VERSION-CONTROL requests.  If the

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8%20%20Label%20Feature"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" name="section-8">8</a>  Label Feature</span>

   A version "label" is a string that distinguishes one version in a
   version history from all other versions in that version history.  A
   label can automatically be assigned by a server, or it can be
   assigned by a client in order to provide a meaningful name for that
   version.  A given version label can be assigned to at most one
   version of a given version history, but client assigned labels can be
   reassigned to another version at any time.  Note that although a
   given label can be applied to at most one version from the same
   version history, the same label can be applied to versions from
   different version histories.

   For certain methods, if the request-URL identifies a version-
   controlled resource, a label can be specified in a Label request
   header (see <a href="#section-8.3">Section 8.3</a>) to cause the method to be applied to the
   version selected by that label from the version history of that
   version-controlled resource.

   The label feature introduces the following REQUIRED property for a
   version.

   A LABEL request can be applied to a version to modify the labels that
   select that version.  The case of a label name MUST be preserved when
   it is stored and retrieved.  When comparing two label names to decide
   if they match or not, a server SHOULD use a case-sensitive URL-
   escaped UTF-8 encoded comparison of the two label names.

   If a LABEL request is applied to a checked in version-controlled
   resource, the operation MUST be applied to the DAV:checked-in version
   of that version-controlled resource.

   a Label request header to cause the method to be applied to the
   version selected by that label from the version history of that
   version-controlled resource.

   The value of a label header is the name of a label, encoded using
   URL-escaped UTF-8.  For example, the label "release B.3" is
   identified by the following header:

     Label: release%20B.3

   A Label header MUST have no effect on a request whose request-URL
   does not identify a version-controlled resource.  In particular, it
   MUST have no effect on a request whose request-URL identifies a
   version or a version history.

   A server MUST return an HTTP-1.1 Vary header containing Label in a
   successful response to a cacheable request (e.g., GET) that includes
   a Label header.

   The working-resource feature provides an alternative to the workspace
   feature for supporting parallel development.  Unlike the workspace
   feature, where the desired configuration of versions and checked-out
   resources is maintained on the server, the working-resource feature
   maintains the configuration on the client.  This simplifies the
   server implementation, but does not allow a user to access the
   configuration from clients in different physical locations, such as
   from another office, from home, or while traveling.  Another
   difference is that the workspace feature isolates clients from a
   logical change that involves renaming shared resources, until that
   logical change is complete and tested; with the working resource
   feature, all clients use a common set of shared version-controlled
   resources and every client sees the result of a MOVE as soon as it
   occurs.

   If a server supports the working-resource feature but not the
   checkout-in-place feature, a CHECKOUT request can only be used to
   create a working resource, and cannot be used to check out a
   version-controlled resource.  If a server supports the checkout-in-
   place feature, but not the working-resource feature, a CHECKOUT can
   only be used to change the state of a version-controlled resource
   from checked-in to checked-out.

   Advanced versioning addresses the problems of parallel development
   and configuration management of multiple sets of interrelated
   resources.  Traditionally, artifacts of software development,
   including requirements, design documents, code, and test cases, have
   been a focus of configuration management.  Web sites, comprising
   multiple inter-linked resources (HTML, graphics, sound, CGI, and
   others), are another class of complex information artifacts that
   benefit from the application of configuration management.  The
   advanced versioning capabilities for coordinating concurrent change
   provide the infrastructure for efficient and controlled management of
   large evolving web sites.

   Although a server MAY support any combination of advanced versioning
   features, in order to minimize the complexity of a WebDAV advanced
   versioning client, a WebDAV advanced versioning server SHOULD support
   one of the following packages:

   Advanced-Server-Workspace Package: basic-server-workspace package
   plus all advanced features

   Advanced-Client-Workspace Package: basic-client-workspace package
   plus all advanced features

   The advanced-server-workspace package supports advanced versioning
   capabilities for a client with no persistent state.  The advanced-
   client-workspace package supports advanced versioning capabilities
   for a client that maintains configuration state on the client.  A
   server that supports both advanced workspace packages will
   interoperate with all versioning clients.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.2%20Advanced%20Versioning%20Terms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10.2" name="section-10.2">10.2</a> Advanced Versioning Terms</span>

   The following additional terms are used by the advanced versioning
   features.

   Collection

      A "collection" is a resource whose state consists of not only
      content and properties, but also a set of named "bindings", where
      a binding identifies what <a href="rfc2518.html">RFC 2518</a> calls an "internal member" of
      the collection.  Note that a binding is not a resource, but rather
      is a part of the state of a collection that defines a mapping from
      a binding name (a URL segment) to a resource (an internal member
      of the collection).

   Collection Version Resource

      A "collection version resource", or simply "collection version",
      captures the dead properties of a version-controlled collection,
      as well as the names of its version-controlled bindings (see
      <a href="#section-14">Section 14</a>).  A version-controlled binding is a binding to a
      version-controlled resource.  If the checkout-in-place feature is
      supported, a collection version can be created by checking out and
      then checking in a version-controlled collection.  If the
      working-resource feature is supported, a collection version can be
      created by checking out a collection version (to create a "working
      collection") and then checking in the working collection.

   Configuration

      A "configuration" is a set of resources that consists of a root
      collection and all members (not just internal members) of that
      root collection that are not members of another configuration.
      The root collection is called the "configuration root", and the
      members of this set are called the "members of the configuration".
      Note that a collection (which is a single resource) is very
      different from a configuration (which is a set of resources).

   Baseline Resource

      A "baseline resource", or simply "baseline", of a collection is a
      version of the configuration that is rooted at that collection
      (see <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>).  In particular, a baseline captures the
      DAV:checked-in version of every version-controlled member of that
      configuration.  Note that a collection version (which captures the
      state of a single resource) is very different from a collection
      baseline (which captures the state of a set of resources).

   Baseline-Controlled Collection

      A "baseline-controlled collection" is a collection from which
      baselines can be created (see <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>).

   Version-Controlled Configuration Resource

      A "version-controlled configuration resource", or simply
      "version-controlled configuration", is a special kind of version-
      controlled resource that is associated with a baseline-controlled
      collection, and is used to create and access baselines of that
      collection (see <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>).  When a collection is both version-
      controlled and baseline-controlled, a client can create a new
      version of the collection by checking out and checking in that
      collection, and it can create a new baseline of that collection by
      checking out and checking in the version-controlled configuration
      of that collection.

   Activity Resource

      An "activity resource", or simply "activity", is a resource that
      selects a set of versions that correspond to a single logical
      change, where the versions selected from a given version history
      form a single line of descent through that version history (see
      <a href="#section-13">Section 13</a>).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11%20Merge%20Feature"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11" name="section-11">11</a> Merge Feature</span>

   When a user wants to accept the changes (new versions) created by
   someone else, it is important not just to update the version-
   controlled resources in the user's workspace with those new versions,
   since this could result in "backing out" changes the user has made to
   those version-controlled resources.  Instead, the versions created in
   another workspace should be "merged" into the user's version-
   controlled resources.

   The version history of a version-controlled resource provides the
   information needed to determine the result of the merge.  In
   particular, the merge should select whichever version is later in the
   line of descent from the root version.  In case the versions to be
   merged are on different lines of descent (neither version is a
   descendant of the other), neither version should be selected, but
   instead, a new version should be created that contains the logical
   merge of the content and dead properties of those versions.  The
   MERGE request can be used to check out each version-controlled
   resource that requires such a merge, and set the DAV:merge-set
   property of each checked-out resource to identify the version to be
   merged.  The user is responsible for modifying the content and dead
   properties of the checked-out resource so that it represents the
   logical merge of that version, and then adding that version to the
   DAV:predecessor-set of the checked-out resource.

   If the server is capable of automatically performing the merge, it
   MAY update the content, dead properties, and DAV:predecessor-set of
   the checked-out resource itself.  Before checking in the
   automatically merged resource, the user is responsible for verifying
   that the automatic merge is correct.

   This property identifies each version that the server has merged into

   The MERGE method performs the logical merge of a specified version
   (the "merge source") into a specified version-controlled resource
   (the "merge target").  If the merge source is neither an ancestor nor
   a descendant of the DAV:checked-in or DAV:checked-out version of the
   merge target, the MERGE checks out the merge target (if it is not
   already checked out) and adds the URL of the merge source to the
   DAV:merge-set of the merge target.  It is then the client's
   responsibility to update the content and dead properties of the
   checked-out merge target so that it reflects the logical merge of the
   merge source into the current state of the merge target.  The client
   indicates that it has completed the update of the merge target, by
   deleting the merge source URL from the DAV:merge-set of the checked-
   out merge target, and adding it to the DAV:predecessor-set.  As an
   error check for a client forgetting to complete a merge, the server
   MUST fail an attempt to CHECKIN a version-controlled resource with a
   non-empty DAV:merge-set.

   When a server has the ability to automatically update the content and
   dead properties of the merge target to reflect the logical merge of
   the merge source, it may do so unless DAV:no-auto-merge is specified
   in the MERGE request body.  In order to notify the client that a
   merge source has been automatically merged, the MERGE request MUST
   add the URL of the auto-merged source to the DAV:auto-merge-set
   property of the merge target, and not to the DAV:merge-set property.
   The client indicates that it has verified that the auto-merge is
   valid, by deleting the merge source URL from the DAV:auto-merge-set,
   and adding it to the DAV:predecessor-set.

   Multiple merge sources can be specified in a single MERGE request.
   The set of merge sources for a MERGE request is determined from the
   DAV:source element of the MERGE request body as follows:

   -  If DAV:source identifies a version, that version is a merge
      source.
   -  If DAV:source identifies a version-controlled resource, the
      DAV:checked-in version of that version-controlled resource is a
      merge source.

   -  If DAV:source identifies a collection, the DAV:checked-in version
      of each version-controlled resource that is a member of that
      collection is a merge source.

   The request-URL identifies the set of possible merge targets.  If the
   request-URL identifies a collection, any member of the configuration
   rooted at the request-URL is a possible merge target.  The merge
   target of a particular merge source is the version-controlled or
   checked-out resource whose DAV:checked-in or DAV:checked-out version
   is from the same version history as the merge source.  If a merge
   source has no merge target, that merge source is ignored.

   The MERGE response identifies the resources that a client must modify
   to complete the merge. It also identifies the resources modified by
   the request, so that a client can efficiently update any cached state
   it is maintaining.

   Marshalling:

      The request body MUST be a DAV:merge element.

      The response to a successful request MUST include a Location

      (DAV:descendant-version): If the merge target was a checked-in
      version-controlled resource whose DAV:checked-in version was an
      ancestor of the merge source, an UPDATE operation MUST have been
      applied to the merge target to set its content and dead properties
      to be those of the merge source.  If the UPDATE method is not
      supported, the merge target MUST have been checked out, the
      content and dead properties of the merge target MUST have been set
      to those of the merge source, and the merge source MUST have been
      added to the DAV:auto-merge-set of the merge target.  The merge
      target MUST appear in a DAV:response XML element in the response
      body.

      (DAV:checked-out-for-merge): If the merge target was a checked-in
      version-controlled resource whose DAV:checked-in version was
      neither a descendant nor an ancestor of the merge source, a
      CHECKOUT MUST have been applied to the merge target.  All XML
      elements in the DAV:merge XML element that could appear in a
      DAV:checkout XML element MUST have been used as arguments to the
      CHECKOUT request.  The merge target MUST appear in a DAV:response
      XML element in the response body.

      (DAV:update-merge-set): If the DAV:checked-out version of the
      merge target is neither equal to nor a descendant of the merge
      source, the merge source MUST be added to either the DAV:merge-set
      or the DAV:auto-merge-set of the merge target.  The merge target
      MUST appear in a DAV:response XML element in the response body.

   to be merged into the resource identified by the request-URL
   (commonly, a collection).

   Marshalling:

      A DAV:conflict-preview element identifies a merge target that
      requires a merge.

      &lt;!ELEMENT conflict-preview (target, common-ancestor, version)&gt;

      A DAV:common-ancestor element identifies the version that is a

      DAV:checked-out version of the merge target.

      &lt;!ELEMENT common-ancestor (href)&gt;

      A DAV:ignore-preview element identifies a version that has no

   A configuration is a set of resources that consists of a root
   collection and all members of that root collection except those
   resources that are members of another configuration.  A configuration
   that contains a large number of resources can consume a large amount
   of space on a server.  This can make it prohibitively expensive to
   remember the state of an existing configuration by creating a
   Depth:infinity copy of its root collection.

   A baseline is a version resource that captures the state of each
   version-controlled member of a configuration.  A baseline history is
   a version history whose versions are baselines.  New baselines are
   created by checking out and then checking in a special kind of
   version-controlled resource called a version-controlled
   configuration.

   A collection that is under baseline control is called a baseline-
   controlled collection.  In order to allow efficient baseline
   implementation, the state of a baseline of a collection is limited to

   be a set of versions and their names relative to the collection, and
   the operations on a baseline are limited to the creation of a
   baseline from a collection, and restoring or merging the baseline
   back into a collection.  A server MAY automatically put a collection
   under baseline control when it is created, or a client can use the
   BASELINE-CONTROL method to put a specified collection under baseline
   control.

   As a configuration gets large, it is often useful to break it up into
   a set of smaller configurations that form the logical "components" of
   that configuration.  In order to capture the fact that a baseline of
   a configuration is logically extended by a component configuration
   baseline, the component configuration baseline is captured as a
   "subbaseline" of the baseline.

   The root collection of a configuration is unconstrained with respect
   to its relationship to the root collection of any of its components.
   In particular, the root collection of a configuration can have a
   member that is the root collection of one of its components (e.g.,
   configuration /sys/x can have a component /sys/x/foo), can be a
   member of the root collection of one of its components (e.g.,
   configuration /sys/y/z can have a component /sys/y), or neither
   (e.g., configuration /sys/x can have a component /comp/bar).

   Since a version-controlled configuration is a version-controlled
   resource, it has all the properties of a version-controlled resource.
   In addition, the baseline feature introduces the following REQUIRED
   property for a version-controlled configuration.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.1.1%20DAV%3Abaseline-controlled-collection%20%28protected%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.1.1" name="section-12.1.1">12.1.1</a> DAV:baseline-controlled-collection (protected)</span>

   This property identifies the collection that contains the version-
   controlled resources whose DAV:checked-in versions are being tracked
   by this version-controlled configuration.  The DAV:version-
   controlled-configuration of the DAV:baseline-controlled-collection of
   a version-controlled configuration MUST identify that version-

   The DAV:resourcetype of a baseline MUST be DAV:baseline.  Since a
   baseline is a version resource, it has all the properties of a
   version resource.  In addition, the baseline feature introduces the
   following REQUIRED properties for a baseline.

   This property contains a server-defined URL for a collection, where
   each member of this collection MUST either be a version-controlled
   resource with the same DAV:checked-in version and relative name as a
   version-controlled member of the baseline-controlled collection at
   the time the baseline was created, or be a collection needed to
   provide the relative name for a version-controlled resource.

   The URLs in the DAV:subbaseline-set property MUST identify a set of
   other baselines.  The subbaselines of a baseline are the baselines
   identified by its DAV:subbaseline-set and all subbaselines of the
   baselines identified by its DAV:subbaseline-set.

   &lt;!ELEMENT subbaseline-set (href*)&gt;

   If the resource is a member of a version-controlled configuration

   identifies that version-controlled configuration.

   A collection can be placed under baseline control with a
   BASELINE-CONTROL request.  When a collection is placed under baseline
   control, the DAV:version-controlled-configuration property of the
   collection is set to identify a new version-controlled configuration.
   This version-controlled configuration can be checked out and then
   checked in to create a new baseline for that collection.

   If a baseline is specified in the request body, the DAV:checked-in
   version of the new version-controlled configuration will be that
   baseline, and the collection is initialized to contain version-
   controlled members whose DAV:checked-in versions and relative names
   are determined by the specified baseline.

   If no baseline is specified, a new baseline history is created
   containing a baseline that captures the state of the version-
   controlled members of the collection, and the DAV:checked-in version
   of the version-controlled configuration will be that baseline.

      (DAV:must-have-no-version-controlled-members): If a DAV:baseline
      element is specified in the request body, the collection
      identified by the request-URL MUST have no version-controlled
      members.

      (DAV:one-baseline-controlled-collection-per-history-per-
      workspace):  If the request-URL identifies a workspace or a member
      of a workspace, and if a baseline is specified in a DAV:baseline
      element in the request body, then there MUST NOT be another
      collection in that workspace whose DAV:version-controlled-
      configuration property identifies a version-controlled
      configuration for the baseline history of that baseline.

   Postconditions:

      (DAV:create-version-controlled-configuration): A new version-
      controlled configuration is created, whose DAV:baseline-
      controlled-collection property identifies the collection.

      (DAV:reference-version-controlled-configuration): The
      DAV:version-controlled-configuration of the collection identifies
      the new version-controlled configuration.

      (DAV:select-existing-baseline): If the request body specifies a
      baseline, the DAV:checked-in property of the new version-
      controlled configuration MUST have been set to identify this
      baseline.  A version-controlled member of the collection will be
      created for each version in the baseline, where the version-
      controlled member will have the content and dead properties of
      that version, and will have the same name relative to the
      collection as the corresponding version-controlled resource had
      when the baseline was created.  Any nested collections that are
      needed to provide the appropriate name for a version-controlled
      member will be created.

      request body, the request MUST have created a new baseline history
      at a server-defined URL, and MUST have created a new baseline in
      that baseline history.  The DAV:baseline-collection of the new
      baseline MUST identify a collection whose members have the same
      relative name and DAV:checked-in version as the version-controlled
      members of the request collection.  The DAV:checked-in property of
      the new version-controlled configuration MUST identify the new

   In this example, the collection /src is placed under baseline
   control, and is populated with members from an existing baseline.  A
   new version-controlled configuration (/repo/vcc/128) is created and
   associated with /src, and /src is initialized with version-controlled
   members whose DAV:checked-in versions are those selected by the
   DAV:baseline-collection (/repo/bc/15) of the specified baseline
   (/repo/blh/13/ver/8).  The following diagram illustrates the
   resulting state on the server.

   In order to create new baselines of /src, /repo/vcc/128 can be
   checked out, new versions can be created or selected by the version-
   controlled members of /src, and then /repo/vcc/128 can be checked in
   to capture the current state of those version-controlled members.

   A DAV:compare-baseline report contains the differences between the
   baseline identified by the request-URL (the "request baseline") and
   the baseline specified in the request body (the "compare baseline").

   Marshalling:

      The request body MUST be a DAV:compare-baseline XML element.

      &lt;!ELEMENT compare-baseline (href)&gt;

      The response body for a successful request MUST be a DAV:compare-
      baseline-report XML element.

      &lt;!ELEMENT compare-baseline-report
       (added-version | deleted-version | changed-version)*&gt;

      A DAV:added-version element identifies a version that is the
      DAV:checked-in version of a member of the DAV:baseline-collection
      of the compare baseline, but no version in the version history of
      that version is the DAV:checked-in version of a member of the
      DAV:baseline-collection of the request baseline.

      &lt;!ELEMENT added-version (href)&gt;

      A DAV:deleted-version element identifies a version that is the
      DAV:checked-in version of a member of the DAV:baseline-collection
      of the request baseline, but no version in the version history of
      that version is the DAV:checked-in version of a member of the
      DAV:baseline-collection of the compare baseline.

      &lt;!ELEMENT deleted-version (href)&gt;

      A DAV:changed-version element identifies two different versions
      from the same version history that are the DAV:checked-in version
      of the DAV:baseline-collection of the request baseline and the
      compare baseline, respectively.

      &lt;!ELEMENT changed-version (href, href)&gt;

      configuration MUST have been updated so that they have the same
      relative name, content, and dead properties as the members of the
      DAV:baseline-collection of the baseline.  In particular:

      -  A version-controlled member for a given version history MUST
         have been deleted if there is no version-controlled member for
         that version history in the DAV:baseline-collection of the
         baseline.
      -  A version-controlled member for a given version history MUST
         have been renamed if its name relative to the baseline-
         controlled collection is different from that of the version-
         controlled member for that version history in the
         DAV:baseline-collection of the baseline.
      -  A new version-controlled member MUST have been created for each
         member of the DAV:baseline-collection of the baseline for which
         there is no corresponding version-controlled member in the
         baseline-controlled collection.
      -  An UPDATE request MUST have been applied to each version-
         controlled member for a given version history whose
         DAV:checked-in version is not the same as that of the version-
         controlled member for that version history in the
         DAV:baseline-collection of the baseline.

      (DAV:update-subbaselines): If the request updated a version-
      controlled configuration whose DAV:baseline-controlled-collection
      contains a baseline-controlled member for one of the subbaselines
      of the request baseline, then the DAV:checked-in property of the
      version-controlled configuration of that baseline-controlled
      member MUST have been updated to be that subbaseline.  If the
      request updated a version-controlled configuration whose
      DAV:baseline-controlled-collection is a member of a workspace that
      contains a baseline-controlled member for one of the subbaselines
      of the request baseline, then the DAV:checked-in property of the
      version-controlled configuration of that baseline-controlled
      member MUST have been updated to be that subbaseline.

   An activity is a resource that selects a set of versions that are on
   a single "line of descent", where a line of descent is a sequence of
   versions connected by successor relationships.  If an activity
   selects versions from multiple version histories, the versions
   selected in each version history must be on a single line of descent.

   A common problem that motivates the use of activities is that it is
   often desirable to perform several different logical changes in a
   single workspace, and then selectively merge a subset of those
   logical changes to other workspaces.  An activity can be used to
   represent a single logical change, where an activity tracks all the
   resources that were modified to effect that single logical change.
   When a version-controlled resource is checked out, the user specifies
   which activity should be associated with a new version that will be
   created when that version-controlled resource is checked in.  It is
   then possible to select a particular logical change for merging into
   another workspace, by specifying the appropriate activity in a MERGE
   request.

   Another common problem is that although a version-controlled resource
   may need to have multiple lines of descent, all work done by members
   of a given team must be on a single line of descent (to avoid merging
   between team members).  An activity resource provides the mechanism
   for addressing this problem.  When a version-controlled resource is
   checked out, a client can request that an existing activity be used
   or that a new activity be created.  Activity semantics then ensure
   that all versions in a given version history that are associated with
   an activity are on a single line of descent.  If all members of a
   team share a common activity (or sub-activities of a common
   activity), then all changes made by members of that team will be on a
   single line of descent.

   Activities appear under a variety of names in existing versioning
   systems.  When an activity is used to capture a logical change, it is
   commonly called a "change set".  When an activity is used to capture
   a line of descent, it is commonly called a "branch".  When a system
   supports both branches and change sets, it is often useful to require
   that a particular change set occur on a particular branch.  This
   relationship can be captured by making the change set activity be a
   "subactivity" of the branch activity.

   activity that is in the DAV:activity-set property of this checked-out

   A result of the requirement that an activity must form a single line
   of descent through a given version history is that if multiple
   checked-out resources for a given version history are checked out
   unreserved into a single activity, only the first CHECKIN will
   succeed.  Before another of these checked-out resources can be
   checked in, the user will first have to merge into that checked-out
   resource the latest version selected by that activity from that

   As with any versionable resource, when a collection is put under
   version control, a version history resource is created to contain
   versions for that version-controlled collection.  In order to
   preserve standard versioning semantics (a version of a collection
   should not be modifiable), a collection version only records
   information about the version-controlled bindings of that collection.

   In order to cleanly separate a modification to the namespace from a
   modification to content or dead properties, a version of a collection
   has no members, but instead records in its DAV:version-controlled-
   binding-set property the binding name and version history resource of
   each version-controlled internal member of that collection.  If,
   instead, a collection version contained bindings to other versions,
   creating a new version of a resource would require creating a new
   version of all the collection versions that contain that resource,
   which would cause activities to become entangled.  For example,
   suppose a "feature-12" activity created a new version of /x/y/a.html.
   If a collection version contained bindings to versions of its
   members, a new version of /x/y would have to be created to contain
   the new version of /x/y/a.html, and a new version of /x would have to
   be created to contain the new version of /x/y.  Now suppose a
   "bugfix-47" activity created a new version of /x/z/b.html.  Again, a
   new version of /x/z and a new version of /x would have to be created
   to contain the new version of /x/y/b.html.  But now it is impossible
   to merge just "bugfix-47" into another workspace without "feature-
   12", because the version of /x that contains the desired version of
   /x/z/b.html also contains version of /x/y/a.html created for
   "feature-12".  If, instead, a collection version just records the
   binding name and version history resource of each version-controlled
   internal member, changing the version selected by a member of that
   collection would not require a new version of the collection.  The
   new version is still in the same version history so no new collection
   version is required, and "feature-12" and "bugfix-47" would not
   become entangled.

   In the following example, there are three version histories, named
   VH14, VH19, and VH24, where VH14 contains versions of a collection.
   The version-controlled collection /x has version V2 of version
   history VH14 as its DAV:checked-in version.  Since V2 has recorded
   two version controlled bindings, one with binding name "a" to version
   history VH19, and the other with binding name "b" to version history
   VH24, /x MUST have two version-controlled bindings, one named "a" to
   a version-controlled resource for history VH19, and the other named
   "b" to a version-controlled resource for history VH24.  The version-

   version-controlled bindings are not under version control, and
   therefore can be added or deleted without checking out the version-
   controlled collection.

   Note that a collection version captures only a defined subset of the
   state of a collection.  In particular, a version of a collection
   captures its dead properties and its bindings to version-controlled
   resources, but not its live properties or bindings to non-version-
   controlled resources.

   When a server supports the working-resource feature, a client can
   check out a collection version to create a working collection.
   Unlike a version-controlled collection, which contains bindings to
   version-controlled resources and non-version-controlled resources, a
   working collection contains bindings to version history resources and
   non-version-controlled resources.  In particular, a working
   collection is initialized to contain bindings to the version history
   resources specified by the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of the
   checked out collection version.  The members of a working collection
   can then be deleted or moved to another working collection.  Non-
   version-controlled resources can be added to a working collection
   with methods such as PUT, COPY, and MKCOL.  When a working collection
   is checked in, a VERSION-CONTROL request is automatically applied to
   every non-version-controlled member of the working collection, and
   each non-version-controlled member is replaced by its newly created
   version history.  The DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of the new
   version resulting from checking in a working collection contains the
   binding name and version history URL for each member of the working
   collection.

   A version-controlled collection has all the properties of a

   An UPDATE or MERGE request can give a version-controlled collection a
   version-controlled internal member that has the same name as an
   existing non-version-controlled internal member.  In this case, the
   non-version-controlled internal member takes precedence and is said
   to "eclipse" the new versioned-controlled internal member.  If the
   non-version-controlled internal member is removed (e.g., by a DELETE
   or MOVE), the version-controlled internal member is exposed.

   Additional Postconditions:

      (DAV:new-version-controlled-collection): If the request body
      identified a collection version, the collection at the request-URL
      MUST contain a version-controlled internal member for each
      DAV:version-controlled-binding specified in the DAV:version-
      controlled-binding-set of the collection version, where the name
      and DAV:version-history of the internal member MUST be the
      DAV:binding-name and the DAV:version-history specified by the
      DAV:version-controlled-binding.  If the internal member is a
      member of a workspace, and there is another member of the
      workspace for the same version history, those two members MUST
      identify the same version-controlled resource; otherwise, a
      VERSION-CONTROL request with a server selected version of the
      version history MUST have been applied to the URL for that
      internal member.

   Additional Postconditions:

      (DAV:initialize-version-history-bindings): If the request has been
      applied to a collection version, the new working collection MUST
      be initialized to contain a binding to each of the history
      resources identified in the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of
      that collection version.

      URL identified a working collection, a VERSION-CONTROL request
      MUST have been automatically applied to every non-version-
      controlled member of the working collection, and each non-

      modified the DAV:checked-in version of a version-controlled
      collection, then the version-controlled members of that version-
      controlled collection MUST have been updated.  In particular:

      -  A version-controlled internal member MUST have been deleted if
         its version history is not identified by the DAV:version-
         controlled-binding-set of the new DAV:checked-in version.
      -  A version-controlled internal member for a given version
         history MUST have been renamed if its binding name differs from
         the DAV:binding-name for that version history in the
         DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of the new DAV:checked-in
         version.
      -  A new version-controlled internal member MUST have been created
         when a version history is identified by the DAV:version-
         controlled-binding-set of the DAV:checked-in version, but there
         was no member of the version-controlled collection for that
         version history.  If a new version-controlled member is in a
         workspace that already has a version-controlled resource for

         MUST be just a binding (i.e., another name for) that existing

         properties of the new version-controlled member MUST have been
         initialized to be those of the version specified for that
         version history by the request.  If no version is specified for

   This specification has been designed to be compliant with the IETF
   Policy on Character Sets and Languages [<a href="rfc2277.html" title='"IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages"'>RFC2277</a>].  Specifically,
   where human-readable strings exist in the protocol, either their
   charset is explicitly stated, or XML mechanisms are used to specify
   the charset used.  Additionally, these human-readable strings all
   have the ability to express the natural language of the string.

   Most of the human-readable strings in this protocol appear in
   properties, such as DAV:creator-displayname.  As defined by <a href="rfc2518.html">RFC 2518</a>,
   properties have their values marshaled as XML.  XML has explicit
   provisions for character set tagging and encoding, and requires that
   XML processors read XML elements encoded, at minimum, using the UTF-8
   [<a href="rfc2279.html" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>RFC2279</a>] encoding of the ISO 10646 multilingual plane.  The charset
   parameter of the Content-Type header, together with the XML
   "encoding" attribute, provide charset identification information for
   MIME and XML processors.  Proper use of the charset header with XML
   is described in <a href="rfc3023.html">RFC 3023</a>.  XML also provides a language tagging
   capability for specifying the language of the contents of a
   particular XML element.  XML uses either IANA registered language
   tags (see <a href="rfc3066.html">RFC 3066</a>) or ISO 639 language tags in the "xml:lang"
   attribute of an XML element to identify the language of its content
   and attributes.

   DeltaV applications, since they build upon WebDAV, are subject to the
   internationalization requirements specified in <a href="rfc2518.html#section-16">RFC 2518, Section 16</a>.
   In brief, these requirements mandate the use of XML character set
   tagging, character set encoding, and language tagging capabilities.
   Additionally, they strongly recommend reading <a href="rfc3023.html">RFC 3023</a> for
   instruction on the use of MIME media types for XML transport and the
   use of the charset header.

   Within this specification, a label is a human-readable string that is
   marshaled in the Label header and as XML in request entity bodies.
   When used in the Label header, the value of the label is URL-escaped
   and encoded using UTF-8.

   All of the security considerations of WebDAV discussed in <a href="rfc2518.html#section-17">RFC 2518,
   Section 17</a> also apply to WebDAV versioning.  Some aspects of the
   versioning protocol help address security risks introduced by WebDAV,
   but other aspects can increase these security risks.  These issues
   are detailed below.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/16.1%20Auditing%20and%20Traceability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-16.1" name="section-16.1">16.1</a> Auditing and Traceability</span>

   WebDAV increases the ease with which a remote client can modify
   resources on a web site, but this also increases the risk of
   important information being overwritten and lost, either through user
   error or user maliciousness.  The use of WebDAV versioning can help
   address this problem by guaranteeing that previous information is
   saved in the form of immutable versions, and therefore is easily
   available for retrieval or restoration.  In addition, the version
   history provides a log of when changes were made, and by whom.  When
   requests are appropriately authenticated, the history mechanism

   provides a clear audit trail for changes to web resources.  This can
   often significantly improve the ability to identify the source of the
   security problem, and thereby help guard against it in the future.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/16.2%20Increased%20Need%20for%20Access%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-16.2" name="section-16.2">16.2</a> Increased Need for Access Control</span>

   WebDAV versioning provides a variety of links between related pieces
   of information.  This can increase the risk that authentication or
   authorization errors allow a client to locate sensitive information.
   For example, if version history is not appropriately protected by
   access control, a client can use the version history of a public
   resource to identify later versions of that resource that the user
   intended to keep private.  This increases the need for reliable
   authentication and accurate authorization.

   A WebDAV versioning client should be designed to handle a mixture of
   200 (OK) and 403 (Forbidden) responses on attempts to access the
   properties and reports that are supported by a resource.  For
   example, a particular user may be authorized to access the content
   and dead properties of a version-controlled resource, but not be
   authorized to access the DAV:checked-in, DAV:checked-out, or
   DAV:version-history properties of that resource.

   While it is acknowledged that "obscurity" is not an effective means
   of security, it is often a good technique to keep honest people
   honest.  Within this protocol, version URLs, version history URLs,
   and working resource URLs are generated by the server and can be
   properly obfuscated so as not to draw attention to them.  For
   example, a version of "<a href="http://foobar.com/reviews/salaries.html">http://foobar.com/reviews/salaries.html</a>" might
   be assigned a URL such as "<a href="http://foobar.com/repo/4934943">http://foobar.com/repo/4934943</a>".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/16.4%20Denial%20of%20Service"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-16.4" name="section-16.4">16.4</a> Denial of Service</span>

   The auto-versioning mechanism provided by WebDAV can result in a
   large number of resources being created on the server, since each
   update to a resource could potentially result in the creation of a
   new version resource.  This increases the risk of a denial of service
   attack that exhausts the storage capability of a server.  This risk
   is especially significant because it can be an unintentional result
   of something like an aggressive auto-save feature provided by an
   editing client.  A server can decrease this risk by using delta
   storage techniques to minimize the cost of additional versions, and
   by limiting auto-versioning to a locking client, and thereby
   decreasing the number of inadvertent version creations.

Appendix A - Resource Classification

   This document introduces several different kinds of versioning
   resources, such as version-controlled resources, versions, checked-
   out resources, and version history resources.  As clients discover
   resources on a server, they may find it useful to classify those
   resources (for example, to make UI decisions on choice of icon and
   menu options).

   Clients should classify a resource by examining the values of the
   DAV:supported-method-set (see <a href="#section-3.1.3">Section 3.1.3</a>) and DAV:supported-live-
   property-set (see <a href="#section-3.1.4">Section 3.1.4</a>) properties of that resource.

   The following list shows the supported live properties and methods
   for each kind of versioning resource.  Where an optional feature
   introduces a new kind of versioning resource, that feature is noted
   in parentheses following the name of that kind of versioning
   resource.  If a live property or method is optional for a kind of
   versioning resource, the feature that introduces that live property
   or method is noted in parentheses following the live property or
   method name.
