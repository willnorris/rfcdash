platforms. The profile is referred to as the Voice Profile for
Internet Mail (VPIM) in this document. These platforms have
historically been special-purpose computers and often do not have the
same facilities normally associated with a traditional Internet Email-
capable computer. As a result, VPIM also specifies additional
functionality, as it is needed. This profile is intended to specify
the minimum common set of features to allow interworking between
conforming systems. This document obsoletes RFC 2421 and describes
version 2 of the profile with greater precision. No protocol changes

   same facilities normally associated with a traditional Internet
   Email-capable computer.  As a result, VPIM also specifies additional
   functionality, as it is needed.  This profile is intended to specify
   the minimum common set of features to allow interworking between
   conforming systems.

   MIME is the Internet multipurpose, multimedia-messaging standard.
   This document explicitly recognizes its capabilities and provides a
   mechanism for the exchange of various messaging technologies,
   primarily voice and facsimile.

   Voice messaging evolved as telephone answering service into a full
   send, receive, and forward messaging paradigm with unique message
   features, semantics and usage patterns.  Voice messaging was
   introduced on special purpose computers that interface to a telephone
   switch and provide call answering and voice messaging services.
   Traditionally, messages sent from one voice messaging system to
   another were transported using analog networking protocols based on
   DTMF signaling and analog voice playback. As the demand for
   networking increases, there was a need for a standard high-quality
   digital protocol to connect these machines.  VPIM has successfully
   demonstrated its usefulness as this new standard.  VPIM is widely
   implemented and is seeing deployment in customer networks.  This
   document clarifies ambiguities found in the earlier specification and
   is consistent with implementation practice.  The profile is referred
   to as Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) in this document.

   This document specifies a restricted profile of the Internet
   multimedia messaging protocols for use between voice processing
   server platforms. These platforms have historically been special-
   purpose computers and often do not have the same facilities normally
   associated with a traditional Internet Email-capable computer.  As a
   result, VPIM also specifies additional functionality, as it is
   needed.  This profile is intended to specify the minimum common set
   of features to allow interworking between conforming systems.

   This document obsoletes <a href="rfc2421.html">RFC 2421</a> and describes VPIM version 2 of with
   greater precision.  No protocol changes were made in this revision.
   A list of changes from <a href="rfc2421.html">RFC 2421</a> are noted in <a href="#appendix-F">Appendix F</a>.  <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>
   summarizes the protocol profiles of this version of VPIM.

   that were considered in creating this baseline profile.

      1) Text messages are not normally received and often cannot be
      easily displayed or viewed.  They can often be processed only via
      text-to-speech or text-to-fax features not currently present in
      many of these machines.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3801.html">RFC 3801</a>                         VPIMv2                        June 2004</span>


      2) Voice mail machines usually act as an integrated Message
      Transfer Agent, Message Store and User Agent.  There is typically
      no relaying of messages.  <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a> header fields may have limited
      use in the context of the limited messaging features currently
      deployed.

      3) Voice mail message stores are generally not capable of
      preserving the full semantics of an Internet message.  As such,
      use of a voice mail machine for gatewaying is not supported.  In
      particular, storage of recipient lists, "Received:" lines, and
      "Message-ID:" may be limited.

      4) Internet-style distribution/exploder mailing lists are not
      typically supported.  Voice mail machines often implement only
      local alias lists, with error-to-sender and reply-to-sender
      behavior. Reply-all capabilities using a Cc list are not generally
      available.

      5) Error reports must be machine-parsable so that helpful
      responses can be voiced to users whose only access mechanism is a
      telephone.

      6) The voice mail systems generally limit address entry to 16 or
      fewer numeric characters, and normally do not support alphanumeric
      mailbox names.  Alpha characters are not generally used for
      mailbox identification, as they cannot be easily entered from a
      telephone terminal.

   It should be noted that newer systems are based natively on SMTP/MIME
   and do not suffer these limitations.  In particular, some systems may
   support media other than voice and fax.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.%20%20Design%20Goals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Design Goals</span>

   It is a goal of this profile to make as few restrictions and
   additions to the existing Internet mail protocols as possible while
   satisfying the requirements for interoperability with current
   generation voice messaging systems.  This goal is motivated by the
   desire to increase the accessibility to digital messaging by enabling
   the use of proven existing networking software for rapid development.

   This specification is intended for use on a TCP/IP network; however,
   it is possible to use the SMTP protocol suite over other transport
   protocols.  The necessary protocol parameters for such use are
   outside the scope of this document.

   This profile is intended to be robust enough to be used in an
   environment, such as the global Internet, with installed-base
   gateways that do not understand MIME.  Full functionality, such as
   reliable error messages and binary transport, will require careful
   selection of gateways (e.g., via MX records) to be used as VPIM
   forwarding agents. Nothing in this document precludes use of
   general-purpose MIME email packages to read and compose VPIM
   messages.  While no special configuration is required to receive VPIM
   conforming messages, some may be required to originate conforming
   structures.

   It is expected that a system administrator who can perform TCP/IP
   network configuration will manage a VPIM messaging system.  When
   using facsimile or multiple voice encodings, it is suggested that the
   system administrator maintain a list of the capabilities of the
   networked mail machines to reduce the sending of undeliverable
   messages due to lack of feature support.  Configuration,
   implementation and management of these directory-listing capabilities
   are local matters.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.%20%20Applicability%20for%20VPIM"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Applicability for VPIM</span>

   VPIM is intended for the exchange of voice messages between
   traditional voice messaging systems and for systems that need to
   interoperate with such systems.  VPIM is intended connect voice-
   messaging systems into special-purpose voice messaging networks.
   VPIM may also be used between message store servers and VPIM-aware
   clients such as web servers, TUI, and GUI clients.  VPIM is not
   intended or optimized for downloading to, or sending from commercial
   email clients.

   Internet Voice Messaging, the subject of a separate standards
   initiative, is intended to enable general-purpose email clients to
   send and receive voice content through general-purpose message stores
   in an interoperable way.  IVM may also be a suitable format for
   downloading voice messages from a VPIM server to a commercial email
   client.  It may also be a suitable format for submission of a voice
   message from a general-purpose client into a VPIM system.

   This protocol does not limit the number of recipients per message.
   Where possible, server implementations should not restrict the number
   of recipients in a single message.  It is recognized that no
   implementation supports unlimited recipients, and that the number of
   supported recipients may be quite low.

   This protocol does not limit the maximum message length.
   Implementers should understand that some machines will be unable to
   accept excessively long messages.  A mechanism is defined in [<a href="#ref-SIZE" title='"SMTP Service Extensions for Message Size Declaration"'>SIZE</a>]
   to declare the maximum message size supported.

   The following sections describe the restrictions and additions to
   Internet mail protocols that are required to be conforming with this
   VPIM v2 profile.  Though various SMTP, ESMTP and MIME features are
   described here, the implementer is referred to the relevant RFCs for
   complete details.  The table in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> summarizes the protocol
   details of this profile.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Voice%20Message%20Interchange%20Format"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Voice Message Interchange Format</span>

   The voice message interchange format is a profile of the Internet
   Mail Protocol Suite.  Any Internet Mail message containing the format
   defined in this section is referred to as a VPIM Message in this
   document.  As a result, this document assumes an understanding of the
   Internet Mail specifications.  Specifically, VPIM references
   components from the message format standard for Internet messages
   [<a href="rfc822.html" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>RFC822</a>], the Multipurpose Internet Message Extensions [MIME1-5], the
   X.400 gateway specification [<a href="#ref-X.400" title='"CCITT Recommendations X.400/ ISO/IEC 10021-1, Message Handling: System and Service Overview"'>X.400</a>], and the delivery status and
   message disposition notifications [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>][DSN][<a href="#ref-DRPT" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extension for Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)"'>DRPT</a>][STATUS][<a href="#ref-MDN" title='"Message Disposition Notification"'>MDN</a>].

   MIME, introduced in [<a href="#ref-MIME1" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME1</a>], is a general-purpose message body format
   that is extensible to carry a wide range of body parts.  It provides
   for encoding binary data so that it can be transported over the 7-bit
   text-oriented SMTP protocol.  This transport encoding (denoted by the
   "Content-Transfer-Encoding:" MIME field) is in addition to the audio
   encoding required to generate a binary object.

   MIME defines two transport-encoding mechanisms to transform binary
   data into a 7-bit representation, one designed for text-like data
   ("Quoted-Printable"), and one for arbitrary binary data ("Base64").
   While Base64 is dramatically more efficient for audio data, either
   will work.  Where binary transport is available, no transport
   encoding is needed, and the data can be labeled as "Binary".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20VPIM%20Message%20Addressing%20Formats"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  VPIM Message Addressing Formats</span>

   VPIM addresses SHALL use the <a href="rfc822.html">RFC 822</a> format based on the Domain Name
   System.  This naming system has two components: the local part, used
   for username or mailbox identification; and the host part, used for
   global machine identification.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.1.%20%20VPIM%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.1" name="section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  VPIM Addresses</span>

   The local part of the address shall be a US-ASCII string uniquely
   identifying a mailbox on a destination system.  For voice messaging,
   the local part SHALL be a printable string containing the mailbox ID
   of the originator or recipient.  While alpha characters and long
   mailbox identifiers MAY be permitted, short numeric local parts
   SHOULD be used as most voice mail networks rely on numeric mailbox
   identifiers to retain compatibility with the limited 10-digit
   telephone keypad.  As a result, some voice messaging systems may only
   be able to handle a numeric local part.  The reception of
   alphanumeric local parts on these systems may result in the address
   being mapped to some locally unique (but confusing to the recipient)
   number or, in the worst case the address could be deleted making the
   message unreplyable.  Additionally, it may be difficult to create
   messages on these systems with an alphanumeric local part without
   complex key sequences or some form of directory lookup (see 6).  The
   use of the Domain Name System should be transparent to the user.  It
   is the responsibility of the voice mail machine to lookup the fully-
   qualified domain name (FQDN) based on the address entered by the user
   (see 6).

   In the absence of a global directory, specification of the local part
   is expected to conform to international or private telephone
   numbering plans.  It is likely that private numbering plans will
   prevail and these are left for local definition.  However, it is
   RECOMMENDED that public telephone numbers be noted according to the
   international numbering plan described in [E.164].  The indication
   that the local part is a public telephone number is given by a
   preceding "+" (the "+" would not be entered from a telephone keypad,
   it is added by the system as a flag). Since the primary information
   in the numeric scheme is contained by the digits, other character
   separators (e.g., "-") may be ignored (i.e., to allow parsing of the
   numeric local mailbox) or may be used to recognize distinct portions
   of the telephone number (e.g., country code).  The specification of
   the local part of a VPIM address can be split into the four groups
   described below:

      1) mailbox number
          - for use as a private numbering plan (any number of digits)
          - e.g., 2722@lucent.com

      2) mailbox number+extension
          - for use as a private numbering plan with extensions
            any number of digits, use of "+" as separator
          - e.g., 2722+111@Lucent.com

      3) +international number
          - for international telephone numbers conforming to E.164
            maximum of 15 digits
          - e.g., +16137637582@vm.nortel.ca

      4) +international number+extension
          - for international telephone numbers conforming to E.164
             maximum of 15 digits, with an extension (e.g., behind a
             PBX) that has a maximum of 15 digits.
          - e.g., +17035245550+230@ema.org

   Note that this address format is designed to be compatible with
   current usage within the voice messaging industry.  It is not
   compatible with the addressing formats of RFCs 2303-2304.  It is
   expected that as telephony services become more widespread on the
   Internet, these addressing formats will converge.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.2.%20%20Special%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.2" name="section-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>.  Special Addresses</span>

   Special addresses to represent the sender are provided for
   compatibility with the conventions of Internet mail.  These addresses
   do not use numeric local addresses, both to conform to current
   Internet practice and to avoid conflict with existing numeric
   addressing plans. Two special addresses are RESERVED for use as
   follows:

   postmaster@domain

   By convention, a special mailbox named "postmaster" MUST exist on all
   systems.  This address is used for diagnostics and should be checked
   regularly by the system manager. This mailbox is particularly likely
   to receive text messages, which is not normal on a voice-processing
   platform.  The specific handling of these messages is an individual
   implementation choice.

   non-mail-user@domain

   If a reply to a message is not possible, such as a telephone-
   answering message, then the special address "non-mail-user" SHOULD be
   used as the originator's address.  Any text name such as "Telephone
   Answering", or the telephone number if it is available, is permitted.
   This special address is used as a token to indicate an unreachable
   originator. A conforming implementation MUST NOT permit a reply to an

   address from "non-mail-user".  For compatibility with the installed
   base of mail user agents, implementations MUST reject the message
   when a message addressed to "non-mail-user" is received.  The status
   code for such NDN's is 5.1.1 "Mailbox does not exist".

   Example:

          From: Telephone Answering &lt;non-mail-user@mycompany.com&gt;

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.3.%20%20Distribution%20Lists"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.3" name="section-4.1.3">4.1.3</a>.  Distribution Lists</span>

   There are many ways to handle distribution list (DL) expansions and
   none are 'standard'.  A VPIM implementation MAY support DLs.  Using a
   simple alias is a behavior closest to what many voice mail systems do
   today and what is to be used with VPIM messages.  A couple of
   important features that need special care when DLs are used are:

      Reply to the originator - (Address in the <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a> "Reply-To:" or
                                 "From" field)
      Errors to the submitter - (Address in the MAIL FROM field of the
                                 ESMTP exchange or the "Return-Path:"
                                 <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a> field)

   Some proprietary voice messaging protocols include only the recipient
   of the particular copy in the envelope and include no "header fields"
   except date and per-message features.  Most voice messaging systems
   do not provide for "Header Information" in their messaging queues and
   only include delivery information.  As a result, recipient
   information MAY be in either the "To:" or "Cc:" header fields. If all
   recipients cannot be presented then the recipient header fields
   SHOULD be omitted to indicate that an accurate list of recipients
   (e.g., for use with a reply-all capability) is not known.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Message%20Header%20Fields"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Message Header Fields</span>

   Internet messages contain a header information block.  This header
   block contains information required to identify the sender, the list
   of recipients, the message send time, and other information intended
   for user presentation.  Except for specialized gateway and mailing
   list cases, header fields do not indicate delivery options for the
   transport of messages.

   Distribution list processors are noted for modifying or adding to the
   header fields of messages that pass through them.  VPIM systems MUST
   be able to accept and ignore header fields that are not defined here.

   The following header lines are permitted for use with VPIM messages:

   SEND RULES

   The originator's fully qualified domain address (a mailbox address
   followed by the fully qualified domain name) MUST be present.
   Systems conforming with this profile SHOULD provide the text personal
   name of the voice message originator in a quoted phrase, if the name
   is available.  Text names of corporate or positional mailboxes MAY be
   provided as a simple string.  From: [<a href="rfc822.html" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>RFC822</a>]

   Example:

               From: "Joe S. User" &lt;12145551212@mycompany.com&gt;

               From: Technical Support &lt;611@serviceprovider.com&gt;

               From: Non-mail-user@myserver.mycompany.com

   Voice mail machines may not be able to support separate attributes
   for the "From:" header fields and the SMTP MAIL FROM, VPIM-conforming
   systems SHOULD set these values to the same address.  Use of
   addresses different than those present in the "From:" header field
   address may result in unanticipated behavior.

   RECEIVE RULES

   The user listed in the "From:" field MUST be presented in the voice
   message envelope of the voice messaging system as the originator of
   the message, though the exact presentation is an implementation
   decision (e.g., the mailbox ID or the text name MAY be presented).
   The "From:" address SHOULD be used for replies (see 4.9).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.2.%20%20To"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.2" name="section-4.2.2">4.2.2</a>.  To</span>

   The "To:" field contains the recipient's fully-qualified domain
   address.

   Example:

               To: +12145551213@mycompany.com

   SEND RULES

   There MAY be one or more "To:" fields in any message.  Systems SHOULD
   provide a list of recipients only if all recipients are available.

   Systems, such as gateways from protocols or legacy platforms that do
   not indicate the complete list of recipients, MAY provide a "To:"
   line. Because these systems cannot accurately enumerate all
   recipients in the "To:" headers, recipients SHOULD NOT be enumerated.

   RECEIVE RULES

   Systems conforming to this profile MAY discard the addresses in the
   "To:" fields if they are unable to store the information.  This
   would, of course, make a reply-to-all capability impossible.  If
   present, the addresses in the "To:" field MAY be used for a reply
   message to all recipients.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.3.%20%20Cc"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.3" name="section-4.2.3">4.2.3</a>.  Cc</span>

   The "Cc:" field contains additional recipients' fully qualified
   domain addresses.  Many voice mail systems maintain only sufficient
   envelope information for message delivery and are not capable of
   storing or providing a complete list of additional recipients.

   SEND RULES

   Conforming implementations MAY send "Cc:" lists if all recipients are
   known at the time of origination.  If not, systems SHOULD omit the
   "Cc:" fields to indicate that the full list of recipients is unknown
   or otherwise unavailable.  The list of disclosed recipients MUST NOT
   include undisclosed recipients (i.e., those sent via a blind copy).

   Example:

               Cc: +12145551213@mycompany.com

   RECEIVE RULES

   Systems conforming to this profile MAY add all the addresses in the
   "Cc:" field to the "To:" field, others MAY discard the addresses in
   the "Cc:" fields.  If a list of "Cc:" addresses is present, these
   addresses MAY be used for a reply message to all recipients.

   If the VPIM sender is relaying a message from a system that does not
   provide a time stamp, the time of arrival at the gateway system
   SHOULD be used as the date.

   The "Sender:" field contains the actual address of the originator if
   an agent on behalf of the author indicated in the "From:" field sends
   the message.

   SEND RULES

   This header field MAY be sent by VPIM-conforming systems.

   RECEIVE RULES

   If the address in the "Sender:" field cannot be preserved in the
   recipient's message queues or in the next-hop protocol from a
   gateway, the field MAY be silently discarded.

   The "Return-path:" field is added by the final delivering SMTP
   server. If present, it contains the address from the MAIL FROM
   parameter of the ESMTP exchange (see [<a href="rfc822.html" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>RFC822</a>]).  Any error messages
   resulting from the delivery failure MUST be sent to this address.
   Note that if the "Return-path:" is null ("&lt;&gt;") (e.g., a call answer
   message would have no return path) delivery status notifications MUST
   NOT be sent.

   SEND RULES

   The originating system MUST NOT add this header.

   RECEIVE RULES

   If the receiving system is incapable of storing the return path (or
   MAIL FROM) to be used for subsequent delivery errors (i.e., it is a
   gateway to a legacy system or protocol), the receiving system must
   otherwise ensure that further delivery errors don't happen.  Systems
   that do not support the return path MUST ensure that at the time the
   message is acknowledged (i.e., when a DSN would be sent), the message
   is delivered to the recipient's ultimate mailbox.  Non-Delivery
   notifications SHOULD NOT be sent after that final delivery.

   The "Message-Id:" field contains a globally unique per-message
   identifier.

   SEND RULES

   A globally unique message-id MUST be generated for each message sent
   from a VPIM-conforming implementation.

   Example:

               Message-Id: &lt;12345678@mycompany.com&gt;

   RECEIVE RULES

   When provided in the original message, it MUST be used when sending a

   If present, the "Reply-To:" header provides a preferred address to
   which reply messages should be sent (see 4.9).  Typically, voice mail
   systems can only support one originator of a message so it is likely
   that this field will be ignored by the receiving system.  From:

   SEND RULES

   A conforming system SHOULD NOT send a "Reply-To:" header.

   RECEIVE RULES

   If a "Reply-To:" field is present, a reply-to-sender message MAY be
   sent to the address specified (that is, in lieu of the address in the
   "From:" field).  If the receiving system (e.g., multi-protocol

   The "Received:" field contains trace information added to the
   beginning of a <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a> message by MTAs.  This is the only field that
   may be added by an MTA.  Information in this header is useful for
   debugging when using an US-ASCII message reader or a header-parsing
   tool.  From: [<a href="rfc822.html" title='"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages"'>RFC822</a>]

   SEND RULES

   A VPIM-conforming system MUST add a "Received:" field.  When acting
   as a gateway, information about the system from which the message was
   received SHOULD be included.

   RECEIVE RULES

   A VPIM-conforming system MUST NOT remove any "Received:" fields when
   relaying messages to other MTAs or gateways.  These header fields MAY
   be ignored or deleted when the message is received at the final
   destination.

   The "MIME-Version:" field MUST be present to indicate that the
   message conforms to [MIME1-5].  Systems conforming with this
   specification SHOULD include a comment with the words "(Voice 2.0)".
   [<a href="#ref-VPIM1" title='"Voice Profile for Internet Mail"'>VPIM1</a>] defines an earlier version of this profile and uses the token
   (Voice 1.0). Example:

               MIME-Version: 1.0 (Voice 2.0)

   This identifier is intended for information only and SHOULD NOT be
   used to semantically identify the message as being a VPIM message.
   Instead, the presence of the multipart/voice-message content type
   defined in <a href="#section-18.2">section 18.2</a> SHOULD be used if identification is
   necessary.

   The "Content-Type:" header MUST be present to declare the type of
   content enclosed in the message.  The typical top-level content in a
   VPIM Message SHOULD be Multipart/Voice-Message.  The allowable
   contents are detailed starting in <a href="#section-4.4">section 4.4</a> of this document.

   Because Internet mail was initially specified to carry only 7-bit
   US-ASCII text, it may be necessary to encode voice and fax data into
   a representation suitable for that environment.  The "Content-
   Transfer-Encoding:" header describes this transformation if it is
   needed.

   SEND RULES

   An implementation in conformance with this profile SHOULD send audio
   and/or facsimile data in "Binary" form when binary message transport
   is available (see <a href="#section-5">section 5</a>).  When binary transport is not
   available, implementations MUST encode the audio and/or facsimile
   data as "Base64".

   RECEIVE RULES

   Conforming implementations MUST recognize and decode the standard
   encodings, "Binary" (when binary support is available), "7bit,
   "8bit", "Base64" and "Quoted-Printable" per [<a href="#ref-MIME1" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>MIME1</a>].  The detection
   and decoding of "Quoted-Printable", "7bit", and "8bit" MUST be
   supported in order to meet MIME requirements and to preserve
   interoperability with the fullest range of possible devices.

   The "Sensitivity:" field, if present, indicates the requested privacy
   level.  If no privacy is requested, this field is omitted.  The
   header definition is as follows:

   Sensitivity := "Sensitivity" ":" Sensitivity-value

   Sensitivity-value := "Personal" / "Private" / "Company-Confidential"

   SEND RULES

   A VPIM-conforming implementation MAY include this header to indicate
   the sensitivity of a message.  If a user marks a message "Private", a
   conforming implementation MUST send only the "Private" sensitivity
   level.  There are no VPIM-specific semantics defined for the values
   "Personal" or "Company-Confidential".  A conforming implementation
   SHOULD NOT send the values "Personal" or "Company-Confidential".  If
   the message is of "Normal" sensitivity, this field SHOULD be omitted.

   RECEIVE RULES

   If a "Sensitivity:" field with a value of "Private" is present in the
   message, a conforming system MUST prohibit the recipient from
   forwarding this message to any other user.  A conforming system,
   however, SHOULD allow the responder to reply to a sensitive message,
   but SHOULD NOT include the original message content.  The responder
   MAY set the sensitivity of the reply message.

   A receiving system MAY ignore sensitivity values of "Personal" and
   "Company Confidential".

   If the receiving system does not support privacy and the sensitivity
   is "Private", a negative delivery status notification MUST be sent to
   the originator with the appropriate status code (5.6.0) "Other or
   undefined protocol status" indicating that privacy could not be
   assured.  The message contents SHOULD be returned to the sender to
   allow for a voice context with the notification.  A non-delivery
   notification to a private message SHOULD NOT be tagged private since
   it will be sent to the originator.  From: [<a href="#ref-X.400" title='"CCITT Recommendations X.400/ ISO/IEC 10021-1, Message Handling: System and Service Overview"'>X.400</a>]

   A message with no privacy explicitly noted (i.e., no header) or with

   SEND RULES

   For compatibility with text-based mailbox interfaces, a text subject
   field SHOULD be generated by a conforming implementation.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that voice-messaging systems that do not support any text
   user interfaces (e.g., access only by a telephone) insert a generic
   subject header of "VPIM Message" or "Voice Message" for the benefit
   of GUI-enabled recipients.

   RECEIVE RULES

   It is anticipated that many voice-only systems will be incapable of
   storing the subject line.  The subject MAY be discarded by a
   receiving system.

   SEND RULES

   This field MAY be added to a voice body part to offer a freeform
   description of the voice content.  It is useful to incorporate the
   values for Content-Disposition with additional descriptions.  For
   example, this can be used to indicate product name or transcoding
   records.

   RECEIVE RULES

   This field MAY be displayed to the recipient.  However, since it is

   This field MUST be present to allow the parsable identification of
   body parts within a VPIM voice message.  This is especially useful
   if, as is typical, more than one Audio/* body occurs within a single
   level (e.g., Multipart/Voice-Message).  Since a VPIM voice message is
   intended to be automatically played in the order in which the audio
   contents occur, the audio contents MUST always be of disposition
   inline.  However, it is still useful to include a filename value, so
   this SHOULD be present if this information is available.  From:
   [<a href="#ref-DISP" title='"Communicating Presentation Information in Internet Messages: The Content-Disposition Header"'>DISP</a>]

   SEND RULES

   In order to distinguish between the various types of audio contents
   in a VPIM voice message a new disposition parameter "voice" is
   defined with IANA (see <a href="#section-18.1">section 18.1</a>) with the parameter values below
   to be used as appropriate:

   Audio-Type := "voice" "=" Audio-type-value

   Audio-type-value := "Voice-Message" / "Voice-Message-Notification" /
   "Originator-Spoken-Name" /"Recipient-Spoken-Name" /"Spoken-Subject"

      Voice-Message - the primary voice message,
      Voice-Message-Notification - a spoken delivery notification
        or spoken disposition notification,
      Originator-Spoken-Name - the spoken name of the originator,
      Recipient-Spoken-Name - the spoken name of the recipient(s) if
        available to the originator
      Spoken-Subject- the spoken subject of the message, typically
        spoken by the originator

   Note that there SHOULD only be one instance of each of these types of
   audio contents per message level.  Additional instances of a given
   type (i.e., parameter value) MAY occur within an attached forwarded
   or reply voice message.  If there are multiple recipients for a given
   message, recipient-spoken-name MUST NOT be used.

   RECEIVE RULES

   Implementations SHOULD use this header.  However, those that do not
   understand the "voice" parameter (or the "Content-Disposition:"
   header) can safely ignore it, and will present the audio body parts
   in order (but will not be able to distinguish between them).  If more
   than one instance of the "voice" parameter type value is encountered
   at one level (e.g., multiple 'Voice-Message' tagged contents) then
   they SHOULD be presented together.

   The content types described in this section are identified for use
   within the Multipart/Voice-Message content.  This content is referred
   to as a "VPIM message" in this document and is the fundamental part
   of a "VPIM message".

   Only the contents profiled can be sent within a VPIM voice message
   construct (i.e., the Multipart/Voice-Message content type) to form a
   simple or a more complex structure (several examples are given in
   <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>).  The presence of other contents within a VPIM voice
   message is not permitted. In the absence of a bilateral agreement,
   conforming implementations MUST NOT create a message containing
   prohibited contents.  In the spirit of liberal acceptance, a
   conforming implementation MAY accept and render prohibited content.
   Systems unable to accept or render prohibited contents MAY discard
   the prohibited contents as necessary to deliver the acceptable
   content.  When multiple contents are present within the
   Multipart/Voice-Message, they SHOULD be presented to the user in the
   order that they appear in the message.

   Some deployed implementations based on a common interpretation of the
   original VPIM v2 specification reject messages with prohibited
   content rather than discard the unsupported contents.  For
   interoperability with these systems, it is especially important that
   prohibited contents not be sent within a Multipart/Voice-Message.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.1.%20%20Multipart%2FVoice-Message"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.1" name="section-4.4.1">4.4.1</a>.  Multipart/Voice-Message</span>

   This MIME multipart structure provides a mechanism for packaging a
   voice message into one container that is tagged as VPIM v2
   conforming.  The sub-type is identical in semantics and syntax to
   multipart/mixed, as defined in [<a href="#ref-MIME2" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types "'>MIME2</a>].  As such, it may be safely
   interpreted as a multipart/mixed by systems that do not understand
   the sub-type (only the identification as a voice message would be
   lost).

   In addition to the MIME required boundary parameter, a version
   parameter is also required for this sub-type.  This is to distinguish
   this refinement of the sub-type from the previous definition in
   [<a href="#ref-VPIM1" title='"Voice Profile for Internet Mail"'>VPIM1</a>].  The value of the version parameter is "2.0" if the content
   conforms to the requirements of this specification.  Should there be
   further revisions of this content type, there MUST be backwards
   compatibility (i.e., systems implementing version n can read version
   2, and systems implementing version 2 can read version 2 contents
   within a version n).

   SEND RULES

   The Multipart/Voice-Message content-type MUST only contain the
   profiled media and content types specified in this section (i.e.,
   Audio/*, Image/*, and Message/RFC822).  The most common will be:
   spoken name, spoken subject, the message itself, and an attached fax.
   Forwarded messages are created by simply using the Message/RFC822
   construct.

   Conformant implementations MUST use Multipart/Voice-Message in a VPIM
   message.  In most cases, this Multipart/Voice-Message Content-Type
   will be the top level but may be included within a Message/RFC822 if
   the message is forwarded or within a multipart/mixed when more than
   one message is being forwarded.

   RECEIVE RULES

   Conformant implementations MUST recognize the Multipart/Voice-Message
   content (whether it is a top-level content or contained in a
   Multipart/Mixed) and MUST be able to separate the contents (e.g.,
   spoken name or spoken subject).

   The semantic of Multipart/Voice-Message (defined in <a href="#section-18.2">section 18.2</a>) is
   identical to Multipart/Mixed and may be interpreted as that by
   systems that do not recognize this content-type.

   SEND RULES

   MIME requires support of the Message/RFC822 message encapsulation
   body part.  This body part SHOULD be used within a Multipart/Voice-
   Message to forward complete messages (see 4.8) or to reply with
   original content (see 4.9).  From: [<a href="#ref-MIME2" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types "'>MIME2</a>]

   RECEIVE RULES

   The receiving system MUST accept this format and SHOULD treat this
   attachment as a forwarded message.  The receiving system MAY flatten
   the forwarding structure (i.e., remove this construct to leave
   multiple voice contents or even concatenate the voice contents to fit
   in a recipient's mailbox), if necessary.

   SEND RULES

   An implementation conforming to this profile MUST send Audio/32KADPCM
   by default for voice [<a href="#ref-ADPCM" title='"Toll Quality Voice - 32 kbit/s Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) MIME Sub-type Registration"'>ADPCM</a>].  This encoding is a moderately-
   compressed encoding with a data rate of 32 kbits/second using
   moderate processing resources. Typically, this body contains several
   minutes of message content;  however, if used for spoken name or
   subject the content is expected to be considerably shorter (i.e.,
   about 5 and 10 seconds respectively).

   RECEIVE RULES

   Receivers MUST be able to accept and decode Audio/32KADPCM.  If an
   implementation can only handle one voice body, then multiple voice
   bodies (if present) SHOULD be concatenated, and MUST NOT be
   discarded. If concatenated, the contents SHOULD be in the same order
   they appeared in the multipart.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.4.%20%20Image%2FTIFF"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.4" name="section-4.4.4">4.4.4</a>.  Image/TIFF</span>

   A common image encoding for facsimile, known as TIFF-F, is a
   derivative of the Tag Image File Format (TIFF) and is described in
   several documents.  For the purposes of VPIM, the F Profile of TIFF
   for Facsimile (TIFF-F) is defined in [<a href="#ref-TIFF-F" title='"Tag Image File Format: Application F"'>TIFF-F</a>], and the Image/TIFF
   MIME content-type is defined in [<a href="#ref-TIFFREG" title='"Tag Image File Format: image/tiff - MIME sub-type registration"'>TIFFREG</a>].  While there are several
   formats of TIFF, only TIFF-F is profiled for use within
   Multipart/Voice-Message. Further, since the TIFF-F file format is
   used in a store-and-forward mode with VPIM, the image MUST be encoded
   so that there is only one image strip per facsimile page.

   SEND RULES

   All VPIM implementations that support facsimile MUST generate TIFF-F
   compatible facsimile contents in the Image/TIFF subtype using the
   application=faxbw encoding by default.  If the VPIM message is a
   voice- annotated fax, the implementation SHOULD send this fax content
   in Multipart/Voice-Message.  If the message is a simple fax, an
   implementation MAY send it without using the Multipart/Voice-Message
   to be more compatible with fax-only (<a href="rfc2305.html">RFC 2305</a>) implementations.

   While any valid MIME body header MAY be used (e.g., Content-
   Disposition to indicate the filename), none are specified to have
   special semantics for VPIM and MAY be ignored.  Note that the
   content-type parameter application=faxbw MUST be included in outbound
   messages.

   RECEIVE RULES

   Not all VPIM systems support fax, but all SHOULD accept it within the
   multipart/voice-message.  Within a Multipart/Voice-Message, a
   receiving system that cannot render fax content SHOULD accept the
   voice content of a VPIM message and discard the fax content.  Outside
   a Multipart/Voice-Message, a recipient system MAY reject (with
   appropriate NDN) the entire message if it cannot store or is not
   capable of rendering a message with fax attachments.  VPIM conforming
   systems MAY support fax outside of (or without) the Multipart/Voice-
   Message.

   Some deployed implementations based on a common interpretation of the

   within the Multipart/Voice-Message rather than discard the

   The following MIME contents (with the exception of multipart/mixed in
   <a href="#section-4.5.1">section 4.5.1</a>) MAY be included within a multipart/voice message.
   Other contents MUST NOT be included.  Their handling is a local
   implementation issue.  Multipart/mixed is included to promote
   interoperability with a wider range of systems and also to allow the
   creation of more complex multimedia messages (with a VPIM message as
   one part).

   This common MIME content-type allows the enclosing of several body
   parts in a single message.

   SEND RULES

   A VPIM voice message (i.e., multipart/voice-message) MAY be included
   within a message with a Multipart/Mixed top-level content type.
   Typically, this would only be used when mixing non-voice and non-fax
   contents with a voice message.

   RECEIVE RULES

   Such a message is not itself a VPIM message and the handling of such
   a construct is outside the scope of the VPIM profile.  However, an
   the spirit of liberal acceptance, a conforming implementation MUST
   accept and render a VPIM voice message contained in a
   Multipart/Mixed.

   SEND RULES

   This content was profiled in the original specification of VPIM v2 as

   longer a feature of VPIM V2.  Conforming implementations SHOULD NOT
   send the Text/Directory content type.

   RECEIVE RULES

   For compatibility with an earlier specification of VPIM v2, the
   Text/Directory content type MUST be accepted by a conforming

   Use of any other encoding except the required codecs reduces
   interoperability in the absence of explicit knowledge about the
   capabilities of the recipient.  A conforming implementation SHOULD
   NOT use any other encoding unless a unique identifier is registered
   with the IANA prior to use (see [<a href="#ref-MIME4" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures"'>MIME4</a>]).  The voice encodings SHOULD
   be registered as subtypes of Audio. The fax encodings SHOULD be
   registered as subtypes of Image.

   SEND RULES

   Proprietary voice encoding formats or other standard formats SHOULD
   NOT be sent under this profile unless the sender has a reasonable
   expectation that the recipient will accept the encoding.  In
   practice, this requires explicit per-destination configuration
   information maintained either in a directory, personal address book,
   or gateway configuration tables.

   RECEIVE RULES

   Systems MAY accept other Audio/* or Image/* content types if they can
   decode them.  Systems which receive Audio/* or Image/* content types
   which they are unable to deposit or unable to render MUST return the
   message (and SHOULD include the original content) to the originator
   with an NDN indicating media not supported.

   MIME requires support of the basic Text/Plain content type (with the
   US-ASCII character set).  This content type has limited applicability
   within the voice-messaging environment.  However, because VPIM is a
   MIME profile, MIME requirements SHOULD be met.

   SEND RULES

   Conforming VPIM implementations SHOULD NOT send the Text/Plain
   content-type.  Implementations MAY send the Text/Plain content-type
   outside the Multipart/Voice-Message.

   Within a Multipart/Voice-Message, the Text/Plain content-type MAY be

   A DSN is a notification of delivery (positive DSN), non-delivery
   (negative DSN), or temporary delivery delay (delayed DSN).  The top-
   level content-type of a DSN is Multipart/Report, which is defined in
   [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>].  The content-type which distinguishes DSN's from other
   types of notifications is Message/Delivery-Status, which is defined
   in [<a href="#ref-DSN" title='"An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications"'>DSN</a>].

   SEND RULES

   A VPIM-compliant implementation MUST be able to send DSN's that
   conform to [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>] and [<a href="#ref-DSN" title='"An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications"'>DSN</a>].  Unless requested otherwise, a non-
   delivery DSN MUST be sent when any form of non-delivery of a message
   occurs.

   A VPIM-compliant implementation SHOULD provide a spoken delivery
   status in the "human-readable" body part of the DSN, but MAY provide
   a textual status.

   A VPIM-compliant implementation MUST be able to receive a DSN whose

   An MDN is a notification indicating what happens to a message after
   it is deposited in the recipient's mailbox.  An MDN can be positive
   (message was read/played/rendered/etc.) or negative (message was
   deleted before recipient could see it, etc.).  The top-level
   content-type of a MDN is Multipart/Report, which is defined in
   [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>].  The content-type which distinguishes MDN's from other
   types of notifications is Message/Disposition-Notification, which is
   defined in [<a href="#ref-MDN" title='"Message Disposition Notification"'>MDN</a>].

   SEND RULES

   A VPIM-compliant implementation SHOULD support the ability to request
   MDNs.  This is done via the use of the "Disposition-Notification-To:"
   header field as defined in [<a href="#ref-MDN" title='"Message Disposition Notification"'>MDN</a>].

   A VPIM-compliant implementation SHOULD support the ability to send
   MDNs, but these MDNs MUST conform to [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>] and [<a href="#ref-MDN" title='"Message Disposition Notification"'>MDN</a>].

   When sending an MDN, a VPIM-compliant implementation SHOULD provide a
   spoken message disposition in the "human-readable" body part of the
   MDN, but MAY provide a textual status.

   RECEIVE RULES

   A VPIM-compliant implementation SHOULD respond to an MDN request with
   an MDN response.

   A VPIM-compliant implementation MUST be able to receive MDNs that
   conform to [<a href="#ref-REPORT" title='"The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages"'>REPORT</a>] and [<a href="#ref-MDN" title='"Message Disposition Notification"'>MDN</a>], if it is capable of requesting MDNs.
   If a VPIM-compliant implementation is capable of receiving MDNs, it
   MUST be able to receive a MDN whose "human-readable" body part

   VPIM v2 explicitly supports the forwarding of voice and fax content
   with voice or fax annotation.  However, only the two constructs
   described below are acceptable in a VPIM message.  Since only the
   first (i.e., Message/RFC822) can be recognized as a forwarded message
   (or even multiple forwarded messages), it is RECOMMENDED that this
   construct be used whenever possible.





<span class="grey">Vaudreuil &amp; Parsons         Standards Track                    [Page 26]</span></pre>

   Forwarded VPIM messages SHOULD be sent as a Multipart/Voice-Message
   with the entire original message enclosed in a Message/RFC822
   content-type and the annotation as a separate Audio/* or Image/* body
   part.  If the <a href="rfc822.html">RFC822</a> header fields are not available for the
   forwarded content, simulated header fields with available information
   SHOULD be constructed to indicate the original sending timestamp, and
   the original sender as indicated in the "From:" field.  Note that at
   least one of "From:", "Subject:", or "Date:" MUST be present.  As
   well, the Message/RFC822 content MUST include at least the "MIME-
   Version:", and "Content-Type:" header fields.  From: [<a href="#ref-MIME2" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types "'>MIME2</a>]

   In the event that forwarding information is lost, the entire audio
   content MAY be sent as a single Audio/* segment without including any
   forwarding semantics.  An example of this loss is an AMIS message
   being forwarded through an AMIS-to-VPIM gateway.

   VPIM v2 explicitly supports replying to received messages.

   Support of multiple originator header fields in a reply message is
   often not possible on voice messaging systems, so it may be necessary
   to choose only one when gatewaying a VPIM message to another voice
   message system.  However, implementers should note that this may make
   it impossible to send DSN's, MDN's, and replies to their proper
   destinations.

   In some cases, replying to a message is not possible, such as with a
   message created by telephone answering (i.e., classic voice mail).
   In this case, the From field SHOULD contain the special address non-
   mail-user@domain (see 4.1.2).  The recipient's VPIM system SHOULD NOT
   offer the option to reply to this kind of message (unless an
   outcalling feature is offered - which is out of scope for VPIM).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Message%20Transport%20Protocol"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Message Transport Protocol</span>

   Messages are transported between voice mail machines using the
   Internet Extended Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (ESMTP).  All
   information required for proper delivery of the message is included
   in the ESMTP dialog.  This information, including the sender and
   recipient addresses, is commonly referred to as the message
   "envelope".  This information is equivalent to the message control
   block in many analog voice messaging protocols.

   ESMTP is a general-purpose messaging protocol, designed both to send
   mail and to allow terminal console messaging.  Simple Mail Transport
   Protocol (SMTP) was originally created for the exchange of US-ASCII
   7-bit text messages.  Binary and 8-bit text messages have

   traditionally been transported by encoding the messages into a 7-bit
   text-like form.  [<a href="#ref-ESMTP" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>ESMTP</a>] formalized an extension mechanism for SMTP,
   and subsequent RFCs have defined 8-bit text networking, command
   streaming, binary networking, and extensions to permit the
   declaration of message size for the efficient transmission of large
   messages such as multi-minute voice mail.

   The following sections list ESMTP commands, keywords, and parameters
   that are required and those that are optional for conformance to this
   profile.

   VPIM utilizes a number of SMTP Service Extensions to provide full-
   featured voice messaging service.  The following extensions are
   profiled for use with VPIM:

   The DSN extension defines a mechanism which allows an SMTP client to
   specify (a) DSN's should be generated under certain conditions, (b)
   whether such DSN's should return the contents of the message, and (c)
   additional information, to be returned with a DSN, that allows the
   sender to identify both the recipient(s) for which the DSN was
   issued, and the transaction in which the original message was sent.

   The DSN extension MUST be supported by VPIM conforming
   implementations.

   In addition, beyond the requirements of [<a href="#ref-DRPT" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extension for Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs)"'>DRPT</a>], conforming
   implementations MUST support NOTIFY parameter on the RCPT command to
   allow indication of when the originator requests a notification.  The
   RET parameter SHOULD be supported to return the original message with

   The SMTP extensions suggested or required for conformance to VPIM
   fall into two categories.  The first category includes features that
   increase the efficiency of the transport system such as SIZE,
   BINARYMIME, and PIPELINING.  In the event of a downgrade to a less-
   functional transport system, these features can be dropped with no
   functional change to the sender or recipient.

   The second category of features is transport extensions in support of
   new functions.  DSN and ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES provide essential
   improvements in the handling of delivery status notifications to
   bring email to the level of reliability expected of Voice Mail.  To
   ensure a consistent level of service across an intranet or the global
   Internet, it is essential that VPIM-conforming ESMTP support the DSN
   extension at all hops between a VPIM originating system and the
   recipient system.  In the situation where a "downgrade" is
   unavoidable a relay hop may be forced (by the next hop) to forward a
   VPIM message without the ESMTP request for delivery status
   notification.  It is RECOMMENDED that the downgrading system should
   continue to attempt to deliver the message, but MUST send an
   appropriate delivery status notification to the originator, e.g., the
   message left an ESMTP host and was sent relayed to a non-DSN-aware
   destination, and this may be the last DSN received.

   It is the responsibility of a VPIM system to provide the fully-
   qualified domain name (FQDN) of the recipient based on the address
   entered by the user (if the entered address is not already a FQDN).
   This would typically be an issue on systems that offer only a
   telephone user interface.  The mapping of the dialed target number to
   a routable FQDN address, allowing delivery to the destination system,
   can be accomplished through implementation-specific means.

   To facilitate a local cache, an implementation may wish to populate
   local directories with the first and last names, as well as the
   senders' spoken name information extracted from received messages.
   Addresses or names parsed from the header fields of VPIM messages MAY
   be used to populate directories.

   The Internet protocols provide a mechanism for the management of
   messaging systems, from the management of the physical network
   through the management of the message queues.  SNMP SHOULD be
   supported on a VPIM-conforming machine.

   VPIM is a messaging application that will be supported in several
   environments and be supported on differing devices.  These
   environments include traditional voice processing systems, desktop
   voice messaging systems, store-and-forward relays, and protocol
   translation gateways.

   In order to accommodate all environments, this document defines two
   areas of conformance: transport and content.

   Transport-conformant systems will pass VPIM messages in a store-and-
   forward manner with assured delivery notifications and without the
   loss of information.  It is expected that most store-and-forward
   Internet mail-based messaging systems will be VPIM transport-
   conformant.

   Content-conformant systems will generate and interpret VPIM messages.
   Conformance in the generation of VPIM messages indicates that the
   restrictions of this profile are honored.  Only contents specified in
   this profile or extensions agreed to by bilateral agreement may be
   sent. Conformance in the interpretation of VPIM messages indicates
   that all VPIM content types and constructs can be received;  that all
   mandatory VPIM content types can be decoded and presented to the
   recipient in an appropriate manner; and that any unrenderable
   contents result in the appropriate notification.

   A summary of the conformance requirements is contained in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

   VPIM end systems are expected to be both transport- and content-
   conformant.  Voice messaging systems and protocol conversion gateways
   are considered end systems.

   Relay systems are expected to be transport-conformant in order to
   receive and send conforming messages.  However, they must also create
   VPIM-conforming delivery status notifications in the event of
   delivery problems.

   Desktop Email clients that support VPIM are expected to be content-
   conformant.  Desktop email clients use various protocols and API's
   for exchanging messages with the local message store and message
   transport system.  While these clients may benefit from VPIM

   This document is a profile of existing Internet mail protocols.  To
   maintain interoperability with Internet mail, any security to be
   provided should be part of the Internet security infrastructure,
   rather than a new mechanism or some other mechanism outside of the
   Internet infrastructure.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.2.%20%20Threats%20and%20Problems"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.2" name="section-9.2">9.2</a>.  Threats and Problems</span>

   Both Internet mail and voice messaging have their own set of threats
   and countermeasures.  As such, this specification does not create any
   security issues not already existing in the profiled Internet mail
   and voice mail protocols themselves.  This section attends only to
   the set of additional threats that ensue from integrating the two
   services.

   The actual sender of the voice message might not be the same as that
   specified in the "Sender:" or "From:" message header fields or the
   MAIL FROM address from the SMTP envelope.  In a tightly constrained
   environment, sufficient physical and software controls may be able to
   ensure prevention of this problem.  In addition, the recognition of
   the sender's voice may provide confidence of the sender's identity
   irrespective of that specified in "Sender:" or "From:".  It should be
   recognized that SMTP implementations do not provide inherent
   authentication of the senders of messages, nor are sites under
   obligation to provide such authentication.

   Assigning an Internet mail address to a voice mailbox opens the
   possibility of receiving unsolicited messages (either text or voice
   mail).  Traditionally, voice mail systems operated in closed
   environments and were not susceptible to unknown senders.  Voice mail
   users have a higher expectation of mailbox privacy and may consider
   such messages as a security breach.  Many Internet mail systems are
   choosing to block all messages from unknown sources in an attempt to
   curb this problem.

   Users of voice messaging systems have an expectation of a level of
   message privacy that is higher than the level provided by Internet
   mail without security enhancements.  This expectation of privacy by
   users SHOULD be preserved as much as possible.

   The following table summarizes the profile of VPIM version 2 detailed
   in this document.  Since in many cases it is not possible to simplify
   the qualifications for supporting each feature this appendix is
   informative. The reader is recommended to read the complete
   explanation of each feature in the referenced section.  The text in
   the previous sections shall be deemed authoritative if any item in
   this table is ambiguous.

   The conformance table is separated into various columns:

      Feature - name of protocol feature (note that the indenting
                indicates a hierarchy of conformance, i.e., the
                conformance of a lower feature is only relevant if there
                is conformance to the higher feature)

      Section - reference section in main text of this document

      Area - conformance area to which each feature applies:
           C - content
           T - transport


   Status - whether the feature is mandatory, optional, or prohibited.
   The key words used in this table are to be interpreted as described
   in [<a href="#ref-REQ" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>REQ</a>], though the following list gives a quick overview of the
   different degrees of feature conformance:

        Must         - mandatory
        Should       - required in the absence of a compelling
                       need to omit.
        May          - optional
        Should not   - prohibited in the absence of a compelling
                       need.
        Must not     - prohibited

   Footnote - special comment about conformance for a particular feature

   To: IANA@IANA.ORG

   Subject: Registration of new Content-Disposition parameter

   Content-Disposition parameter name: voice

   Allowable values for this parameter:

         Voice-Message - the primary voice message,
         Voice-Message-Notification - a spoken delivery notification
           or spoken disposition notification,
         Originator-Spoken-Name - the spoken name of the originator,
         Recipient-Spoken-Name - the spoken name of the recipient if
           available to the originator and present if there is ONLY one
           recipient,
         Spoken-Subject- the spoken subject of the message, typically
           spoken by the originator

   Description:

   In order to distinguish between the various types of audio contents
   in a VPIM voice message a new disposition parameter "voice" is
   defined with the preceding values to be used as appropriate.  Note
   that there SHOULD only be one instance of each of these types of
   audio contents per message level.  Additional instances of a given
   type (i.e., parameter value) may occur within an attached forwarded
   voice message.

      The version parameter that contains the value "2.0" if
      enclosed content conforms to [VPIM2R2].  The absence of this
      parameter indicates conformance to the previous version
      defined in <a href="rfc1911.html">RFC 1911</a> [<a href="#ref-VPIM1" title='"Voice Profile for Internet Mail"'>VPIM1</a>].

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations: 7bit, 8bit or Binary

   Security considerations:

      This definition identifies the content as being a voice
      message.  In some environments (though likely not the
      majority), the loss of the anonymity of the content may be a
      security issue.

   Interoperability considerations:

      Systems developed to conform with [<a href="#ref-VPIM1" title='"Voice Profile for Internet Mail"'>VPIM1</a>] may not conform to
      this registration.  Specifically, the required version will
      likely be absent, in this case the recipient system should
      still be able to accept the message and will be able to
      handle the content.  The VPIM v1 positional identification,
      however, would likely be lost.

   The updated profile in this document is based on the implementation
   and operational deployment experience of several vendors.  The
   changes are categorized as general, content, transport and
   conformance.  They are summarized below:

   1. General

      - Various and substantial editorial updates to improve
        readability.

      - Separated send rules from receive rules to aid clarity.

      - Clarified the behavior upon reception of unrecognized content
        types expected with the interworking between voice and unified
        messaging systems.  (E.g., Unsupported non-audio contents should
        be discarded to deliver the audio message.)

      - Reworked the sensitivity requirements to align them with X.400.
        Eliminated dependencies upon the MIXER documents.

      - Reorganized the content-type descriptions for clarity

   2. Content

      - Changed handling of received lines by a gateway to SHOULD NOT
        delete in a gateway.  In gateways to systems such as AMIS, it is
        not possible to preserve this information.  It is intended that
        such systems be able to claim conformance.

      - Eliminated the vCard as a supported VPIM V2 content type.

      - Merged in text from <a href="rfc2423.html">RFC 2423</a> (Multipart/voice-message)

   3. Transport

      - None

   4. Conformance

      - Aligned the table of <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> to the requirements in the text.
