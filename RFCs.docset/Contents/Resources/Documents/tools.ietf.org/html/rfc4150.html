   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="rfc2578.html" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="rfc2579.html" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and STD 58, <a href="rfc2580.html">RFC 2580</a>

   This document continues the architecture created in the RMON2-MIB
   [<a href="rfc2021.html" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base Version 2 using SMIv2"'>RFC2021</a>] by providing a major feature upgrade, primarily by
   providing new metrics and studies to assist in the analysis of
   performance for sub-application transaction flows in the network, in
   direct relationship to the transport of application layer protocols.

   Performance-monitoring agents have been widely used to analyze the
   parameters and metrics related to the perceived performance of
   distributed applications and services in networks.  The metrics
   collected by these agents have ranged from basic response time to a

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4150.html">RFC 4150</a>                        TPM-MIB                      August 2005</span>


   combination of metrics related to the loss and re-transmission of
   datagrams and PDUs.  Although the metrics are becoming more useful in
   the implementation of service-level monitoring and troubleshooting
   tools, the lack of a standard method to report these has limited the
   deployment to very specific customer needs and areas.

   This document is intended to create a general framework for the
   collection and reporting of performance-related metrics on sub-
   application level transaction flows in a network.  The MIB in this
   document is directly linked to the current RMON2-MIB [<a href="rfc2021.html" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base Version 2 using SMIv2"'>RFC2021</a>], and
   uses the Protocol Directory as a key component in reporting the
   layering involved in the sub-application level transaction flows.

   The specific objectives of this document are to:

      + Provide a drill-down capability to complement the user-perceived
        monitoring defined within the Application Performance
        Measurement MIB (APM-MIB) [<a href="rfc3729.html" title='"Application Performance Measurement MIB"'>RFC3729</a>].  This capability is
        intended to support trouble resolution, further characterization
        of performance, and a finer granularity of monitoring
        capabilities.  The APM-MIB provides a method for retrieving
        aggregated measurement data of the end-user's perception of
        application-level performance.  APM additionally provides
        thresholding and associated alarms if the end-user perceived
        performance degrades below defined thresholds.  The Transport
        Performance Metrics MIB (TPM-MIB) complements the APM-MIB
        capabilities by monitoring sub-application level transaction
        aspects not typically perceived by the end-user.  As an example,
        APM-MIB provides response time statistics of a typical web-
        browser application.  This application typically consists of DNS
        transactions, TCP connection establishment (or multiple
        establishments), HTTP download of the base page, and multiple
        downloads of the various embedded objects.  Ideally, TPM-MIB
        would provide statistics on the performance aspects of these
        multiple sub-application level transactions.

      + Provide additional performance metrics and related statistics.
        For troubleshooting and a finer granularity of performance
        monitoring, it is useful to provide measurements of additional
        metrics beyond those supported by the APM-MIB.

      + Support standards-based metrics and associated statistical
        aggregation by defining methods to reference those standards.
        The TPM-MIB provides a capability to describe metrics by
        reference to appropriate IETF, ITU, or other standards bodies
        defining metrics, including enterprise-specific standards
        bodies.  This capability is provided through the
        tpmMetricsDefTable.

        Specifically, this MIB itself does not make references to metric
        specifications of the IETF, ITU and other organizations.
        Instead, it allows for the setup of the tpmMetricDefTable that
        does reference such IETF, ITU, and other metric specifications,
        and it allows pointers to such specifications to be dynamically
        listed in this table.  The following objects allow for that, and
        the DESCRIPTION clauses (of the objects below) explain how this
        is done:

               tpmMetricDefName OBJECT-TYPE
               tpmMetricDefReference OBJECT-TYPE
               tpmMetricDefGlobalID OBJECT-TYPE

        The tpmMetricDefGlobalID object contains a reference to the
        Object ID in a metrics registration MIB being developed in the
        IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group at the IETF; e.g.,
        the IPPM-REGISTRY-MIB [<a href="rfc4148.html" title='"IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Metrics Registry"'>RFC4148</a>], which defines the metric.  For
        metrics defined within the IPPM Working Group, which are
        included in the IPPM-REGISTRY-MIB, this object is used to
        reference those metrics directly.  For metrics not included
        within the IPPM-REGISTRY-MIB, the value of this object is set
        to 0.0 for none.

        Examples of appropriate references include the ITU-T
        Recommendation Y.1540 [<a href="#ref-Y.1540" title='"IP Data Transport Service - IP packet transfer performance metrics"'>Y.1540</a>] on IP packet transfer performance
        metrics, and the IETF documents from the IPPM WG; e.g., <a href="rfc2681.html">RFC 2681</a>
        on the round trip delay metric [<a href="rfc2681.html" title='"A Round-Trip Delay Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2681</a>] or <a href="rfc3393.html">RFC3393</a> on the delay
        variation metric [<a href="rfc3393.html" title='"IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)"'>RFC3393</a>].  Others include <a href="rfc2679.html">RFC 2679</a> [<a href="rfc2679.html" title='"A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM"'>RFC2679</a>],

        metric is mandatory, implementations should, at a minimum,
        support a round-trip delay and a round-trip loss metric.

      + Provide (as an option) a table storing the measurements of the
        metrics on a transaction by transaction basis.  There are times
        when it is useful to have access to the raw measurements.  The
        tpmCurReportTable optionally provides access to this capability.

   Although this document outlines the basic measurements of performance
   in regard to the transport of application flows, it does not attempt
   to measure or provide a means to measure the actual perceived
   performance of the application transactions or quality.  The detailed
   measurements of end-user-perceived performance are directly related
   to this document and may be found in the APM-MIB [<a href="rfc3729.html" title='"Application Performance Measurement MIB"'>RFC3729</a>].

   The objects defined in this document are intended as an interface

   This document uses some terms that need introduction:

   DataSource
        A source of data for monitoring purposes.  This term is used
        exactly as defined in the RMON2-MIB [<a href="rfc2021.html" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base Version 2 using SMIv2"'>RFC2021</a>].

   protocol
        A specific protocol encapsulation, as identified for monitoring
        purposes.  This term is used exactly as defined in the RMON
        Protocol Identifiers document [<a href="rfc2895.html" title='"Remote Network Monitoring MIB Protocol Identifiers"'>RFC2895</a>].

   performance metric
        A specific, measured reporting metric, as identified for
        monitoring purposes.  There can be several metrics reported by
        an agent in the same implementation.  The metrics are extensible
        based on the agent implementation.

   application
        A network-based, high-level protocol performing useful work to
        an end-user of an end-system.  Typically, the application
        performs multiple request/response transactions to complete its
        work.  E.g., a web application downloading a web page completes
        DNS, TCP-connect, and multiple HTTP GET transactions prior to
        completing its task.

   transactions
        Elemental request/response transactions comprising more complex
        network-based applications.  E.g., a transaction may include an
        ftp get request and the file download in response.

   The objects are arranged in the following groups:

        -- tpmCapabilitiesGroup

        -- tpmAggregateReportsGroup

        -- tpmCurrentReportsGroup

        -- tpmExceptionReportsGroup

   These groups are the basic units of conformance.  If an agent
   implements a group, then it must implement all objects in that group.
   Although this section provides an overview of grouping and
   conformance information for this MIB module, the authoritative
   reference for such information is contained in the MODULE-COMPLIANCE
   and OBJECT-GROUP macros later in this MIB module.

   These groups are defined to provide a means of assigning object
   identifiers, and to provide a method for implementers of managed
   agents to know which objects they must implement.

   In order to measure the performance of traffic flows in a network,
   the proper analysis of a set of statistics is required.  Because a
   large majority of the statistics have a basis of time, the use of a
   simple statistical model is feasible.  Therefore, the MIB definitions
   within this document all use a basic set of statistical computed
   values to assist in further analysis by a management application.

   The remaining subsections in this section detail the common
   structured features the are applied to the performance metrics in the
   statistical format described above.  The tpmMetricsDefTable
   (discussed below) describes the set of metrics supported in this MIB
   module.

   reference link for the purpose of reporting transaction flow details
   on application-level measurements.  As such, the TPM-MIB is designed
   to provide a drill-down extension to the APM-MIB.  Further, it draws
   heavily on the ideas and designs laid out in the APM-MIB.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Statistics%20Perspective"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Statistics Perspective</span>

   When dealing with time-based measurements on application data
   packets, ideally all the timestamps and related data could be stored
   and forwarded for later analysis.  However, when faced with thousands
   of conversations per second on ever-faster networks, storing all the
   data, even if compressed, would take too much processing, memory, and
   manager download time to be practical.

   It is important to note that in dealing with network data we will be
   dealing with statistical populations and not samples.  Statistics
   books deal with both because the math is similar.  In collecting
   agent data, a population (i.e., all the data) must be processed.

   Because of the nature of application protocols, just sampling some of
   the packets will not give good results.  Missing just one critical
   packet, such as one that specified an ephemeral port on which data
   will be transmitted or what application will be run, can cause much
   valid data to be lost.

   The time-based measurements the agent collects will come from
   examining the entire group of data, i.e., the population.  The
   population will be finite.  The agent will seek only to provide
   information that will describe the actual data.  Analysis of that
   data will be left to the management station.

   The simplest form of representing a group of data is by frequency
   distributions, i.e., buckets.  Statistics provides a great many ways
   of analyzing this type of data, and there are some rules in creating
   the buckets.  First, the range needs to be known.  Second, a bucket
   size needs to be determined.  Fixed bucket sizes are best, although
   variable may be used if needed.  However, the statistics texts tend
   only to refer to operations of fixed-size buckets.  This method of
   describing data is expensive for an agent to implement.  First, the



<span class="grey">Dietz &amp; Cole                Standards Track                     [Page 8]</span></pre>

   agent must process a great amount of data at a time.  Storing the
   data, determining the range, locating the buckets, and then filling
   in the data after the fact takes a fair amount of storage and time.
   Fixing the range and bucket sizes in the beginning can be
   problematic, as the agent may have to adjust the values for each of
   the applications it collects data on.  Such numbers can be in the
   thousands.  Additional complexity arises in adding new protocols and
   even in describing the buckets themselves to the management
   application.  This is the approach taken in the APM-MIB.

   A complimentary approach is to provide frequency distribution
   statistics.  They describe aggregation such as mean and standard
   deviation that can be obtained by summation functions on the
   individual data elements in a population.  Analysis of the data
   described by these functions has been thoroughly studied, and
   interpretation of these values is available to anyone with an
   introduction to statistics.  In fact, frequency distributions are
   routinely analyzed to generate these varied numbers, which are then
   used for further analysis.  Note that frequency distributions, by
   their very nature, provide an exact characterization of the data.
   Whereas buckets will introduce error factors that are not present
   with direct analysis by summation-type formulas.  Because the TPM-MIB
   provides a drill-down capability to the APM MIB, it has to measure
   and store much more information than the APM-MIB.  For this reason,
   and in order to complement the APM-MIB, the TPM-MIB relies on
   statistical descriptions rather than a bucket description of the
   measurement data.

   The agent will provide data that can be used to calculate the most
   basic and useful statistical aggregates.  The agent will not perform
   the calculations and will not provide the statistical measurement
   directly.  There are several reasons why this is not desired.  The
   first is that finding the final measurement can be expensive in terms
   of computation and representation.  There are divisions and square
   roots, and the measurements are expressed as floating point values.
   The second is that by providing the variables to the statistical
   functions, those variables are scalable.  It is possible to combine
   smaller intervals into larger ones.

   An example is the arithmetic mean or average.  This is the sum of the
   data divided by the number of data elements.  The agent will provide
   the sum of the x and the number of elements N.  The management
   station can perform the division to obtain the average.  Given two
   samples, they can be combined by adding the sum of the x's and by
   adding the number of elements to get a combined sum and number of
   elements.  The average formula then works just the same.  Also, the
   sum of the x and the number of element variables are used in
   calculating other statistical measurement values.

   The data statistical elements, datum, of the metric have been chosen
   to maximize the amount of data available while minimizing the amount
   of memory needed to store the statistic and minimizing the CPU
   processing requirement needed to generate the statistic.

   The statistic data structure contains five unsigned integer datum.

       N        count of the number of data points for the metric
       S(X)     sum of all the data point values for the metric
       S(X2)    sum of all the data point values squared for the metric
       Xmax     maximum data point value for the metric
       Xmin     minimum data point value for the metric
       S(I*X)   sum of the data points multiplied by their order, i.e.,
                = SUM from i=1 to N { i*X sub i}

   A performance metric is used to describe events over a time interval.
   The measurement points can be processed immediately into the
   statistic and do not have to be stored for later processing.  For
   example, to count the number of events in a time interval, it is
   sufficient to increment a counter for each event.  It is not
   necessary to cache all the events and then to count them at the end
   of the interval.  The statistic is also designed to be easily
   scalable in terms of combining adjacent intervals.  For example, if
   an agent created a specific statistic every 30 seconds and a user
   table interval was set to 60 seconds, the 60-second statistic could
   be obtained by combining the two 30-second statistics.  The following
   rules will be applied when combining adjacent statistics.

       N         S(N)
       S(X)      S(S(X))
       S(X2)     S(S(X2))
       Xmax      MAX(Xmax)
       Xmin      MIN(Xmin)
       S(I*X)    S(I*X) + N*S(X) +S(I*X)
                 where the last two terms refer to the
                 statistics from the later 30 second period
                 and N is the count from the former 30 second
                 period.

   This structure gives a generic framework upon which the actual
   performance statistics will be defined.  Each specific statistical
   definition must address the specific significance, if any, given to
   each metric datum.  While a specific metric definition should try to
   conform to the generic framework, it is acceptable for a metric datum
   to not be used, and to have no meaning, for a specific metric.  In
   such cases the datum will default to a 0 value.

          DESCRIPTION
             "This module defines extensions to the RMON2-MIB module
             for the collection of Performance Metrics related to
             application traffic in a network.  In particular,
             it describes managed objects used for monitoring
             selectable performance metrics and statistics
             derived from the monitoring of network packets and
             sub-application level transactions.

             In order to maintain the RMON 'look-and-feel', some of
             the text from the RMON2 [<a href="rfc2021.html" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base Version 2 using SMIv2"'>RFC2021</a>] and HC-RMON [<a href="rfc3273.html" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base for High Capacity Networks"'>RFC3273</a>]
             MIBs by Steve Waldbusser have been used in this MIB module.

             this MIB module is part of <a href="rfc4150.html">RFC 4150</a>; see the RFC itself for

           "The number of saved reports the agent has allocated based
           on the requested amount in tpmAggrReportCntrlReqReports.
           Because each report can have many entries, the total number

           value of tpmAggrReportCntrlGrantedSize, or by 1 if that
           object doesn't exist.

           When the associated tpmAggrReportCntrlReqReports object is
           created or modified, the agent should set this object as
           closely to the requested value as is possible for the
           particular implementation and available resources.  When
           considering available resources, the agent must consider its
           ability to allocate this many reports, each with the number
           of entries represented by tpmAggrReportCntrlGrantedSize, or
           by 1 if that object doesn't exist.

           Note that although the storage required for each report may
           fluctuate due to changing conditions, the agent must continue
           to have storage available to satisfy the full report size for

           The tpmAggrReportControlIndex value in the index identifies
           the tpmAggrReportCntrlEntry on whose behalf this entry was
           created.  The tpmCurReportAppLocalIndex value in the
           index identifies the application protocol that is being
           reported.  The protocolDirLocalIndex value in the
           index identifies the network layer protocol
           of the tpmAggrReportServerAddress.  When the associated
           tpmAggrReportCntrlAggrType value is
           equal to applications(4), this value will equal 0.
           The tpmCurReportServerAddress value in the
           index identifies the network layer address of the
           server in traffic flows aggregated in this entry.
           The tpmCurReportCurrentApmNameClientID value in the
           index identifies the network layer address of the
           client in traffic flows aggregated in this entry.
           The tpmCurReportCurrentMetricIndex value in the
           index identifies the transported application protocol
           of the traffic flows aggregated in this entry.

           Note that the order of protocolDirLocalIndex variables is
           the opposite of that in the RMON2 MIB (application.network
           instead of network.application); the report entries are
           sorted by application first, server second, and client third.
           The tpmCurReportCntrIndex value in the index identifies
           the tpmAggrReportCntrlEntry on whose behalf this entry was
           created.  The tpmCurReportMetricIndex value in the index
           identifies the metric and protocol of the
           tpmCurReportServerAddress, via the tpmTransMetricDir

   This memo has been produced with a great deal of assistance from
   David Craver, Joseph Maixner, and John Metzger of Hifn, Inc.  The
   authors also gratefully acknowledge the beneficial discussions they
   have had with Carter Bullard of QoSient, LLC.  The tpmMetricDefTable
   was taken from Andy Bierman's performance management capabilities
   document, which was proposed early on in the RMON WG during the
   formation of the TPM and APM MIB work.  Finally, this MIB module
   draws heavily from the work of Steve Waldbusser and his APM-MIB
   [<a href="rfc3729.html" title='"Application Performance Measurement MIB"'>RFC3729</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This MIB relates to a system that provides a passive monitoring
   capability of a broadcast subnet, a switched subnet, or point-to-
   point subnets.  As such, it collects information relating to network
   layer addresses and traffic statistics relating to conversations and
   to application-level activities.  These statistics could be deemed
   sensitive in certain networking environments.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      + The tpmTransMetricDirConfig object describes and configures the
        probe's support for a given performance metric in relation to a
        specified transaction and application.  The agent creates
        entries in this table for all metric and transaction
        combinations that it can generate, and this object controls the
        on/off switch for this capability.  If certain statistics for a
        supported transaction are deemed sensitive, then access to SET
        operations on this object should be protected.

      + The tpmAggrReportCntrlDataSource sets the interface on which the
        network addresses and conversational and application-level
        statistics will be collected.

      + The tpmAggrReportCntrlAggrType object controls the level of data
        aggregation implemented in the report tables.  For example, this
        object could be set to allow client-level information to be
        exposed.

   In order to implement this MIB module, an agent must make certain
   management information available about protocols and network
   addresses used within a managed system, which may be considered
   sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore some of the
   readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a MAX-ACCESS
   other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  It is thus important to control even
   GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
   encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the
   network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      + The tpmAggrReportTable contains the statistical studies which
        the probe was configured to generate.  These tables contain the
        historical, aggregated data providing information on the network
        address and traffic statistics related to their conversations.

      + The tpmCurReportTable contains information on current
        transaction flows.  This table provides a view of the current
        activity on a subnet or a client machine.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="rfc3410.html#section-8">[RFC3410], section 8</a>),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
