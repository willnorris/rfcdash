Abstract

   This document was submitted to the IETF IPng area in response to <a href="rfc1550.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc1550.html">1550</a>.  Publication of this document does not imply acceptance by the
   IPng area of any ideas expressed within.  Comments should be
   submitted to the big-internet@munnari.oz.au mailing list.

Disclaimer and Acknowledgments

   Much of this draft has been adapted from the article "A User's View
   of IPng" by Eric Fleischman which was published in the September 1993
   edition of ConneXions Magazine (Volume 7, Number 9, pages 36 - 40).
   The original ConneXions article represented an official position of
   The Boeing Company on IPng issues.  This memo is an expansion of that
   original treatment.  This version also represents a Boeing corporate
   opinion which we hope will be helpful to the on-going IPng
   discussions.  An assumption of this paper is that other Fortune 100
   companies which have non-computing-related products and services will
   tend to have a viewpoint about IPng which is similar to the one
   presented by this paper.

Executive Summary

   Key points:

   1)  Large corporate users generally view IPng with disfavor.

   2)  Industry and the IETF community have very different values
       and viewpoints which lead to orthogonal assessments concerning
       the desirability of deploying IPng.

   3)  This paper provides insight into the mindset of a large
       corporate user concerning the relevant issues surrounding an
       IPng deployment.  The bottom line is that a new deployment of
       IPng runs counter to several business drivers.  A key point to

       highlight is that end users actually buy applications -- not
       networking technologies.

   4)  There are really only two compelling reasons for a large end
       user to deploy IPng:

       A) The existence of must-have products which are tightly coupled
           with IPng.
       B) Receipt of a command to deploy IPng from senior management.
          The former would probably be a function of significant
          technological advances.  The latter probably would be a
          function of a convergence of IPng with International
          Standards (OSI).

   5)  Five end user requirements for IPng are presented:

       A) The IPng approach must permit piecemeal transitions.
       B) The IPng approach must not hinder technological advances.
       C) The IPng approach is expected to foster synergy with
          International Standards (OSI).
       D) The IPng approach should have "Plug and Play" networking
          capabilities.
       E) The IPng approach must have network security characteristics
          which are better than existing IPv4 protocols.

Introduction

   The goal of this paper is to examine the implications of IPng from
   the point of view of Fortune 100 corporations which have heavily
   invested in TCP/IP technology in order to achieve their (non-computer
   related) business goals.

   It is our perspective that End Users currently view IPng with
   disfavor.  This note seeks to explain some of the reasons why an end
   user's viewpoint may differ significantly from a "traditional IETF"
   perspective.  It addresses some of the reasons which cause IPng to be
   viewed by end users as a "threat" rather than as an "opportunity".
   It enumerates some existing End User dissatisfactions with IPv4
   (i.e., current TCP/IP network layer).  These dissatisfactions may
   perhaps be eventually exploited to "sell" IPng to users.  Finally, it
   identifies the most compelling reasons for end users to deploy IPng.
   In any case, the IETF community should be warned that their own
   enthusiasm for IPng is generally not shared by end users and that
   convincing end users to deploy IPng technologies may be very
   difficult -- assuming it can be done at all.

The Internet and TCP/IP Protocols are not Identical

   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) community closely
   associates TCP/IP protocols with the Internet.  In many cases it is
   difficult to discern from the IETF perspective where the world-wide
   Internet infrastructure ends and the services of the TCP/IP Protocol
   Suite begin -- they are not always distinguishable from each other.
   Historically they both stem from the same roots:  DARPA was the
   creator of TCP/IP and of the seminal "Internet".  The services
   provided by the Internet have been generally realized by the "TCP/IP
   protocol family".  The Internet has, in turn, become a primary
   vehicle for the definition, development, and transmission of the
   various TCP/IP protocols in their various stages of maturity.  Thus,
   the IETF community has a mindset which assumes that there is a strong
   symbiotic relationship between the two.

   End users do not share this assumption -- despite the fact that many
   end users have widely deployed TCP/IP protocols and extensively use
   the Internet.  It is important for the IETF community to realize,
   however, that TCP/IP protocols and the Internet are generally viewed
   to be two quite dissimilar things by the large end user.  That is,
   while the Internet may be a partial selling point for some TCP/IP
   purchases, it is rarely even a primary motivation for the majority of
   purchases.  Many end users, in fact, have sizable TCP/IP deployments
   with no Internet connectivity at all.  Thus, many end users view the
   relationship between the Internet and TCP/IP protocols to be tenuous
   at best.

   More importantly, many corporations have made substantial investments
   in (non-Internet) external communications infrastructures.  A variety
   of reasons account for this including the fact that until recently
   the Internet was excluded from the bilateral agreements and
   international tariffs necessary for international commerce.  In any
   case, end users today are not (in the general case) dependent upon
   the Internet to support their business processes.  [Note: the
   previous sentence does not deny that many Fortune 100 employees (such
   as the author) are directly dependent upon the Internet to fulfill
   their job responsibilities: The Internet has become an invaluable
   tool for many corporations' "research and education" activities.
   However, it is rarely used today for activities which directly affect
   the corporations' financial "bottom line":  commerce.]  By contrast,
   large End Users with extensive internal TCP/IP deployments may
   perhaps view TCP/IP technology to be critically important to their
   corporation's core business processes.

Security Islands

   Another core philosophical difference between large end users and the
   IETF is concerning the importance of Security Islands (i.e.,
   firewalls).  The prevalent IETF perspective is that Security Islands
   are "A Bad Thing".  The basic IETF assumption is that the
   applications they are designing are universally needed and that
   Security Islands provide undesirable filters for that usage.  That
   is, the IETF generally has a world view which presupposes that data
   access should be unrestricted and widely available.

   By contrast, corporations generally regard data as being a
   "sensitive" corporate asset:  If compromised the very viability of
   the corporation itself may in some cases be at risk.  Corporations
   therefore presuppose that data exchange should be restricted.

   Large end users also tend to believe that their employees have
   differing data access needs:  Factory workers have different
   computing needs than accountants who have different needs than
   aeronautical engineers who have different needs than research
   scientists.  A corporation's networking department(s) seeks to ensure
   that each class of employee actually receives the type of services
   they require.  A security island is one of the mechanisms by which
   the appropriate service levels may be provided to the appropriate
   class of employee, particularly in regards to external access
   capabilities.

   More importantly, there are differing classes of computer resources
   within a corporation.  A certain percentage of these resources are
   absolutely critical to the continuing viability of that corporation.
   These systems should never (ever) be accessible from outside of the
   company.  These "corporate jewels" must be protected by viable
   security mechanisms.  Security islands are one very important
   component within a much larger total security solution.

   For these reasons we concur with the observation made by Yakov
   Rekhter (of IBM) and Bob Moskowitz (of Chrysler) in their joint
   electronic mail message of January 28, 1994.  They wrote:

   "Hosts within sites that use IP can be partitioned into three
   categories:

    -    hosts that do not require Internet access.
    -    hosts that need access to a limited set of Internet
         services (e.g., Email, FTP, netnews, remote login) which can
         be handled by application layer relays.
    -    hosts that need unlimited access (provided via IP
         connectivity) to the Internet."



<span class="grey">Fleischman                                                      [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint' style='width: 96ex;' align='left'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-5" id="page-5" href="#page-5" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1687.html">RFC 1687</a>         A Large Corporate User's View of IPng       August 1994</span>


   The exact mechanism by which a corporation will satisfy the differing
   needs of these three classes of devices must be independently
   determined by that corporation based upon a number of internal
   factors.  Each independent solution will determine how that
   corporation defines their own version of "security island".

   Thus, if end users use the Internet at all, they will generally do so
   through a "security island" of their own devising.  The existence of
   the security island is yet another element to (physically and
   emotionally) decouple the End User from the Internet.  That is, while
   the end user may use the Internet, their networks (in the general
   case) are neither directly attached to it nor are their core business
   processes today critically dependent upon it.

Networking from a Large End User's Perspective

   The following five key characteristics describe Boeing's environment
   and are probably generally representative of other large TCP/IP
   deployments. The author believes that an understanding of these
   characteristics is very important for obtaining insight into how the
   large end user is likely to view IPng.

   1) Host Ratio

      Many corporations explicitly try to limit the number of their
      TCP/IP hosts that are directly accessible from the Internet.  This
      is done for a variety of reasons (e.g., security).   While the
      ratio of those hosts that have direct Internet access capabilities
      to those hosts without such capabilities will vary from company to
      company, ratios ranging from 1:1000 to 1:10,000 (or more) are not
      uncommon.  The implication of this point is that the state of the
      world-wide (IPv4) Internet address space only directly impacts a
      tiny percentage of the currently deployed TCP/IP hosts within a
      large corporation.  This is true even if the entire population is
      currently using Internet-assigned addresses.

   2) Router-to-Host Ratio

      Most corporations have significantly more TCP/IP hosts than they
      have IP routers.  Ratios ranging between 100:1 to 600:1 (or more)
      are common. The implication of this point is that a transition
      approach which solely demands changes to routers is generally much
      less disruptive to a corporation than an approach which demands
      changes to both routers and hosts.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1687.html">RFC 1687</a>         A Large Corporate User's View of IPng       August 1994</span>


   3) Business Factor

      Large corporations exist to fulfill some business purpose such as
      the construction of airplanes, baseball bats, cars, or some other
      product or service offering.  Computing is an essential tool to
      help automate business processes in order to more efficiently
      accomplish the business goals of the corporation.  Automation is
      accomplished via applications.  Data communications, operating
      systems, and computer hardware are the tools used by applications
      to accomplish their goals.  Thus, users actually buy applications
      and not networking technologies.  The central lesson of this point
      is that IPng will be deployed according to the applications which
      use it and not because it is a better technology.

   4) Integration Factor

      Large corporations currently support many diverse computing
      environments. This diversity limits the effectiveness of a
      corporation's computing assets by hindering data sharing,
      application interoperability, "application portability", and
      software re-usability.  The net effect is stunted application life
      cycles and increased support costs.  Data communications is but
      one of the domains which contribute towards this diversity.  For
      example, The Boeing Company currently has deployed at least
      sixteen different protocol families within its networks (e.g.,
      TCP/IP, SNA, DECnet, OSI, IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, XNS, etc.).  Each
      distinct Protocol Family population potentially implies unique
      training, administrative, support, and infrastructure
      requirements.  Consequently, corporate goals often exist to
      eliminate or merge diverse Data Communications Protocol Family
      deployments in order to reduce network support costs and to
      increase the number of devices which can communicate together
      (i.e., foster interoperability).  This results in a basic
      abhorrence to the possibility of introducing "Yet Another
      Protocol" (YAP).  Consequently, an IPng solution which introduces
      an entirely new set of protocols will be negatively viewed simply
      because its by-products are more roadblocks to interoperability
      coupled with more work, expense, and risk to support the end
      users' computing resources and business goals. Having said this,
      it should be observed that this abhorrence may be partially
      overcome by "extenuating circumstances" such as applications using
      IPng which meet critical end-user requirements or by broad
      (international) commercial support.

   5) Inertia Factor

      There is a natural tendency to continue to use the current IP
      protocol (IPv4) regardless of the state of the Internet's IPv4
      address space. Motivations supporting inertia include the
      following:  existing application dependencies (including
      Application Programming Interface (API) dependencies); opposition
      to additional protocol complexity; budgetary constraints limiting
      additional hardware/software expenses; additional address
      management and naming service costs; transition costs; support
      costs; training costs; etc.  As the number of Boeing's deployed
      TCP/IP hosts continues to grow towards the 100,000 mark, the
      inertial power of this population becomes increasingly strong.
      However, inertia even exists with smaller populations simply
      because the cost to convert or upgrade the systems are not
      warranted.  Consequently, pockets of older "legacy system"
      technologies often exist in specific environments (e.g., we still
      have pockets of the archaic BSC protocol).  The significance of
      this point is that unless there are significant business benefits
      to justify an IPng deployment, economics will oppose such a
      deployment.  Thus, even if the forthcoming IPng protocol proves to
      be "the ultimate and perfect protocol", it is unrealistic to
      imagine that the entire IPv4 population will ever transition to
      IPng.  This means that should we deploy IPng within our network,
      there will be an ongoing requirement for our internal IPng
      deployment to be able to communicate with our internal IPv4
      community.  This requirement is unlikely to go away with time.

Address Depletion Doesn't Resonate With Users

   Thus, the central, bottom-line question concerning IPng from the
   large corporate user perspective is:  What are the benefits which
   will justify the expense of deploying IPng?

   At this time we can conceive of only four possible causes which may
   motivate us to consider deploying IPng:

   Possible Cause:                        Possible Corporate Response:

   1) Many Remote (external) Peers        Gateway external systems only.
      solely use IPng.

   2) Internet requires IPng usage.       Gateway external systems only.

   3) "Must have" products are tightly    Upgrade internal corporate
      coupled with IPng (e.g., "flows"    network to support IPng where
      for real-time applications).        that functionality is needed.




<span class="grey">Fleischman                                                      [Page 7]</span></pre>

   4) Senior management directs IPng      Respond appropriately.
      usage.

   It should explicitly be noted that the reasons which are compelling
   the Internet Community to create IPng (i.e., the scalability of IPv4
   over the Internet) are not themselves adequate motivations for users
   to deploy IPng within their own private networks.  That is, should
   IPng usage become mandated as a prerequisite for Internet usage, a
   probable response to this mandate would be to convert our few hosts
   with external access capabilities to become IPng-to-IPv4
   application-layer gateways.  This would leave the remainder of our
   vast internal TCP/IP deployment unchanged.  Consequently, given
   gateways for external access, there may be little motivation for a
   company's internal network to support IPng.

User's IPv4 "Itches" Needing Scratching

   The end user's "loyalty" to IPv4 should not be interpreted to mean
   that everything is necessarily "perfect" with existing TCP/IP
   deployments and that there are therefore no "itches" which an
   improved IPv4 network layer -- or an IPng -- can't "scratch".  The
   purpose of this section is to address some of the issues which are
   very troubling to many end users:

   A)  Security.  TCP/IP protocols are commonly deployed upon broadcast
       media (e.g., Ethernet Version 2).  However, TCP/IP mechanisms to
       encrypt passwords or data which traverse this media are
       inadequate.  This is a very serious matter which needs to be
       expeditiously resolved.  An integrated and effective TCP/IP
       security architecture needs to be defined and become widely
       implemented across all venders' TCP/IP products.

   B)  User Address Space privacy.  Current IPv4 network addressing
       policies require that end users go to external entities to obtain
       IP network numbers for use in their own internal networks.  These
       external entities have the hubris to determine whether these
       network requests are "valid" or not.  It is our belief that a
       corporation's internal addressing policies are their own private
       affair -- except in the specific instances in which they may
       affect others.  Consequently, a real need exists for two classes
       of IPv4 network numbers: those which are (theoretically) visible
       to the Internet today (and thus are subject to external
       requirements) and those which will never be connected to the
       Internet (and thus are strictly private).  We believe that the
       concept of "local addresses" is a viable compromise between the
       justifiable need of the Internet to steward scarce global
       resources and the corporate need for privacy.  "Local addresses"
       by definition are non-globally-unique addresses which should



<span class="grey">Fleischman                                                      [Page 8]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint' style='width: 96ex;' align='left'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-9" id="page-9" href="#page-9" class="invisible"> </a>

       never be routed (or seen) by the Internet infrastructure.

       We believe that 16 contiguous Class B "local addresses" need to
       immediately be made available for internal corporate usage.  Such
       an availability may also reduce the long-term demand for new IPv4
       network numbers (see <a href="rfc1597.html">RFC 1597</a>).

   C)  Self-Defining Networks.  Large End Users have a pressing need for
       plug-and-play TCP/IP networks which auto-configure, auto-address,
       and auto-register.  End users have repeatedly demonstrated our
       inability to make the current manual methods work (i.e., heavy
       penalties for human error).  We believe that the existing DHCP
       technology is a good beginning in this direction.

   D)  APIs and network integration.  End users have deployed many
       differing complex protocol families.  We need tools by which
       these diverse deployments may become integrated together along
       with viable transition tools to migrate proprietary
       alternatives to TCP/IP-based solutions.  We also desire products
       to use "open" multi-vendor, multi-platform, exposed Application
       Programming Interfaces (APIs) which are supported across several
       data communications protocol "families" to aid in this
       integration effort.

   E)  International Commerce.  End users are generally unsure as to
       what extent TCP/IP can be universally used for international
       commerce today and whether this is a cost-effective and "safe"
       option to satisfy our business requirements.

   F)  Technological Advances.  We have ongoing application needs which
       demand a continual "pushing" of the existing technology.  Among
       these needs are viable (e.g., integratable into our current
       infrastructures) solutions to the following: mobile hosts,
       multimedia applications, real-time applications, very
       high-bandwidth applications, improved very low-bandwidth (e.g.,
       radio based) applications, standard-TCP/IP-based transaction
       processing applications (e.g., multi-vendor distributed
       databases).

   Only Two Motivations For Users To Deploy IPng

   Despite this list of IPv4 problem areas, we suspect that there are
   only two causes which may motivate users to widely deploy IPng:

      (1) If IPng products add critical functionality which IPv4 can't
      provide (e.g., real time applications, multimedia applications,
      genuine (scalable) plug-and-play networking, etc.), users would be
      motivated to deploy IPng where that functionality is needed.



<span class="grey">Fleischman                                                      [Page 9]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1687.html">RFC 1687</a>         A Large Corporate User's View of IPng       August 1994</span>


      However, these deployments must combat the "Integration Factor"
      and the "Inertia Factor" forces which have previously been
      described.  This implies that there must be a significant business
      gain to justify such a deployment.  While it is impossible to
      predict exactly how this conflict would "play out", it is
      reasonable to assume that IPng would probably be deployed
      according to an "as needed only" policy.  Optimally, specific
      steps would be taken to protect the remainder of the network from
      the impact of these localized changes.  Of course, should IPng
      become bundled with "killer applications" (i.e., applications
      which are extremely important to significantly many key business
      processes) then all bets are off:  IPng will become widely
      deployed.  However, it also should be recognized that virtually
      all (initial) IPng applications, unless they happen to be "killer
      applications", will have to overcome significant hurdles to be
      deployed simply because they represent risk and substantially
      increased deployment and support costs for the end user.

      (2) Should IPng foster a convergence between Internet Standards
      and International Standards (i.e., OSI), this convergence could
      change IPng's destiny.  That is, the networks of many large
      corporations are currently being driven by sets of strong, but
      contradictory, requirements:  one set demanding compliance with
      Internet Standards (i.e., TCP/IP) and another set demanding
      compliance with International Standards.  This paper assumes that
      the reader is already familiar with the many reasons why end users
      seek to deploy and use Internet Standards.  The following is a
      partial list as to why End Users may be motivated to use
      International Standards (i.e., OSI) as well:

   A)  World-wide commerce is regulated by governments in accordance
       with their treaties and legal agreements.  World-wide
       telecommunications are regulated by the ITU (a United Nations
       chartered/authorized organization).  International Standards
       (i.e., OSI) are the only government-sanctioned method for
       commercial data communications.  Aspects of this picture are
       currently in the process of changing.

   B)  The currently proprietary aeronautical world-wide air-to-ground
       and ground-to-ground communications are being replaced by an
       OSI-based (CLNP) Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN)
       internet which is being built in a number of different national
       and international forums including:

       *  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
       *  International Air Transport Association (IATA)
       *  Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC)




<span class="grey">Fleischman                                                     [Page 10]</span></pre>

       "Civil Aviation Authorities, airlines, and private aircraft will
       use the ATN to convey two major categories of data traffic among
       their computers: Air Traffic Services Communications (ATSC) and
       Aeronautical Industry Services Communication (AISC)." [Note: The
       data communications of airline passengers are not addressed by
       the directive.]

   C)  A corporation's customers may have data communications
       requirements which are levied upon them by the governments in
       which they operate which they, in turn, must support in their
       own products in order to fulfill their customers' needs.  For
       example, Boeing is influenced by existing:

       * Computer Aided Logistics Support (CALS; i.e., these are GOSIP
         (OSI)-based) requirements for US Department of Defense
         contractors.
       * Airline requirements emanating from A and B above.

   D)  The end user perception that once we have deployed
       International Standards we will not subsequently be compelled to
       migrate by external factors to another technology.  Thus, we
       would have a "safe" foundation to concentrate upon our real
       computing issues such as increased customer satisfaction,
       business process flow-time improvements, legacy system
       modernization, and cost avoidance.

   E)  The proposals of entities desiring to obtain contracts with
       Governments are evaluated on many subjective and objective
       bases.  One of the subjective issues may well be the
       "responsibility" and "dependability" of the bidder company
       including such intangibles as its corporate like-mindedness.
       For this reason, as long as the Government has OSI as their
       official standard, the bidder may have a subjective advantage if
       its corporate policy also includes a similar standard,
       particularly if data communications services are being
       negotiated.

   F)  The perception that the need for IPng may imply that IPv4 is
       unfit to be a strategic end user alternative.  Also, IPng is not
       a viable deployment option at this time.

   G)  Doubts concerning IPv4 scalability (e.g., toasternet: an
       algorithmic change in which currently "dumb devices" become
       intelligent and suddenly require Internet connectivity).

   It currently appears that many of these "OSI motivations" are
   undergoing change at this time.  This possibility must be tracked
   with interest.  However, a key point of this section is that a



<span class="grey">Fleischman                                                     [Page 11]</span></pre>

   corporation must base its data communications decisions upon business
   requirements.  That is, corporations exist to sell products and
   services, not to play "networking games".

   Thus, if a means could be found to achieve greater synergy
   (integration/ adoption) between Internet Standards and International
   Standards then corporate management may be inclined to mandate
   internal deployment of the merged standards and promote their
   external use.  Optimally, such a synergy should offer the promise of
   reducing currently deployed protocol diversity (i.e., supports the
   "Integration Factor" force).  Depending on the specific method by
   which this convergence is achieved, it may also partially offset the
   previously mentioned "Inertia Factor" force, especially if IPng
   proves to be a protocol which has already been deployed.

User-based IPng Requirements

   From the above one can see that a mandate to use IPng to communicate
   over the Internet does not correspondingly imply the need for large
   corporate networks to generally support IPng within their networks.
   Thus, while the IPv4 scalability limitations are a compelling reason
   to identify a specific IPv4 replacement protocol for the Internet,
   other factors are at work within private corporate networks.  These
   factors imply that large TCP/IP end users will have a continuing need
   to purchase IPv4 products even after IPng products have become
   generally available.

   However, since the IETF community is actively engaged in identifying
   an IPng solution, it is desirable that the solution satisfy as many
   end user needs as possible.  For this reason, we would like to
   suggest that the following are important "user requirements" for any
   IPng solution:

   1)  The IPng approach must permit users to slowly transition to IPng
       in a piecemeal fashion.  Even if IPng becomes widely deployed,
       it is unrealistic to expect that users will ever transition all
       of the extensive IPv4 installed base to IPng.  Consequently, the
       approach must indefinitely support corporate-internal
       communication between IPng hosts and IPv4 hosts regardless of
       the requirements of the world-wide Internet.

   2)  The IPng approach must not hinder technological advances from
       being implemented.

   3)  The IPng approach is expected to eventually foster greater
       synergy (integration/adoption) between Internet Standards and
       International Standards (i.e., OSI).  [Note: This may be
       accomplished in a variety of ways including having the Internet



<span class="grey">Fleischman                                                     [Page 12]</span></pre>

       Standards adopted as International Standards or else having the
       International Standards adopted as Internet Standards.]

   4)  The IPng approach should have "self-defining network" (i.e.,
       "plug &amp; play") capabilities.  That is, large installations
       require device portability in which one may readily move devices
       within one's corporate network and have them autoconfigure,
       autoaddress, autoregister, etc.  without explicit human
       administrative overhead at the new location -- assuming that the
       security criteria of the new location have been met.

   5)  The approach must have network security characteristics which are
       better than existing IPv4 protocols.

Conclusion

   In summary, the key factor which will determine whether -- and to
   what extent -- IPng will be deployed by large end users is whether
   IPng will become an essential element for the construction of
   applications which are critically needed by our businesses.  If IPng
   is bundled with applications which satisfy critical business needs,
   it will be deployed.  If it isn't, it is of little relevance to the
   large end user.  Regardless of what happens to IPng, the large mass
   of IPv4 devices will ensure that IPv4 will remain an important
   protocol for the foreseeable future and that continued development of
   IPv4 products is advisable.
