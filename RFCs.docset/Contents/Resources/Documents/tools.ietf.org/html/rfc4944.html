   The IEEE 802.15.4 standard [<a href="#ref-ieee802.15.4" title='"IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2003"'>ieee802.15.4</a>] targets low-power personal
   area networks.  This document defines the frame format for
   transmission of IPv6 [<a href="rfc2460.html" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>] packets as well as the formation of
   IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly autoconfigured addresses on
   top of IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  Since IPv6 requires support of packet
   sizes much larger than the largest IEEE 802.15.4 frame size, an
   adaptation layer is defined.  This document also defines mechanisms
   for header compression required to make IPv6 practical on IEEE
   802.15.4 networks, and the provisions required for packet delivery in
   IEEE 802.15.4 meshes.  However, a full specification of mesh routing
   (the specific protocol used, the interactions with neighbor
   discovery, etc) is out of the scope of this document.

   IEEE 802.15.4 defines four types of frames: beacon frames, MAC
   command frames, acknowledgement frames, and data frames.  IPv6
   packets MUST be carried on data frames.  Data frames may optionally
   request that they be acknowledged.  In keeping with [<a href="rfc3819.html" title='"Advice for Internet Subnetwork Designers"'>RFC3819</a>], it is
   recommended that IPv6 packets be carried in frames for which
   acknowledgements are requested so as to aid link-layer recovery.

   IEEE 802.15.4 networks can either be nonbeacon-enabled or beacon-
   enabled [<a href="#ref-ieee802.15.4" title='"IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2003"'>ieee802.15.4</a>].  The latter is an optional mode in which
   devices are synchronized by a so-called coordinator's beacons.  This
   allows the use of superframes within which a contention-free
   Guaranteed Time Service (GTS) is possible.  This document does not
   require that IEEE networks run in beacon-enabled mode.  In nonbeacon-
   enabled networks, data frames (including those carrying IPv6 packets)
   are sent via the contention-based channel access method of unslotted
   CSMA/CA.

   In nonbeacon-enabled networks, beacons are not used for
   synchronization.  However, they are still useful for link-layer
   device discovery to aid in association and disassociation events.
   This document recommends that beacons be configured so as to aid
   these functions.  A further recommendation is for these events to be

   available at the IPv6 layer to aid in detecting network attachment, a
   problem being worked on at the IETF at the time of this writing.

   The specification allows for frames in which either the source or
   destination addresses (or both) are elided.  The mechanisms defined
   in this document require that both source and destination addresses
   be included in the IEEE 802.15.4 frame header.  The source or
   destination PAN ID fields may also be included.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Addressing%20Modes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Addressing Modes</span>

   IEEE 802.15.4 defines several addressing modes: it allows the use of
   either IEEE 64-bit extended addresses or (after an association event)
   16-bit addresses unique within the PAN [<a href="#ref-ieee802.15.4" title='"IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2003"'>ieee802.15.4</a>].  This document
   supports both 64-bit extended addresses, and 16-bit short addresses.
   For use within 6LoWPANs, this document imposes additional constraints
   (beyond those imposed by IEEE 802.15.4) on the format of the 16-bit
   short addresses, as specified in <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>.  Short addresses being
   transient in nature, a word of caution is in order: since they are
   doled out by the PAN coordinator function during an association
   event, their validity and uniqueness is limited by the lifetime of
   that association.  This can be cut short by the expiration of the
   association or simply by any mishap occurring to the PAN coordinator.
   Because of the scalability issues posed by such a centralized
   allocation and single point of failure at the PAN coordinator,
   deployers should carefully weigh the tradeoffs (and implement the
   necessary mechanisms) of growing such networks based on short
   addresses.  Of course, IEEE 64-bit extended addresses may not suffer
   from these drawbacks, but still share the remaining scalability
   issues concerning routing, discovery, configuration, etc.

   This document assumes that a PAN maps to a specific IPv6 link.  This
   complies with the recommendation that shared networks support link-
   layer subnet [<a href="rfc3819.html" title='"Advice for Internet Subnetwork Designers"'>RFC3819</a>] broadcast.  Strictly speaking, it is multicast
   not broadcast that exists in IPv6.  However, multicast is not
   supported natively in IEEE 802.15.4.  Hence, IPv6 level multicast
   packets MUST be carried as link-layer broadcast frames in IEEE
   802.15.4 networks.  This MUST be done such that the broadcast frames
   are only heeded by devices within the specific PAN of the link in
   question.  As per Section 7.5.6.2 in [<a href="#ref-ieee802.15.4" title='"IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2003"'>ieee802.15.4</a>], this is
   accomplished as follows:

   1.  A destination PAN identifier is included in the frame, and it
       MUST match the PAN ID of the link in question.

   2.  A short destination address is included in the frame, and it MUST
       match the broadcast address (0xffff).

   Additionally, support for mapping of IPv6 multicast addresses per
   <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> MUST only be used in a mesh configuration.  A full
   specification of such functionality is out of the scope of this
   document.

   As usual, hosts learn IPv6 prefixes via router advertisements as per
   [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Maximum%20Transmission%20Unit"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Maximum Transmission Unit</span>

   The MTU size for IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 is 1280 octets.
   However, a full IPv6 packet does not fit in an IEEE 802.15.4 frame.
   802.15.4 protocol data units have different sizes depending on how
   much overhead is present [<a href="#ref-ieee802.15.4" title='"IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2003"'>ieee802.15.4</a>].  Starting from a maximum
   physical layer packet size of 127 octets (aMaxPHYPacketSize) and a
   maximum frame overhead of 25 (aMaxFrameOverhead), the resultant
   maximum frame size at the media access control layer is 102 octets.
   Link-layer security imposes further overhead, which in the maximum
   case (21 octets of overhead in the AES-CCM-128 case, versus 9 and 13
   for AES-CCM-32 and AES-CCM-64, respectively) leaves only 81 octets
   available.  This is obviously far below the minimum IPv6 packet size
   of 1280 octets, and in keeping with <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> of the IPv6
   specification [<a href="rfc2460.html" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>], a fragmention and reassembly adaptation
   layer must be provided at the layer below IP.  Such a layer is
   defined below in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

   Furthermore, since the IPv6 header is 40 octets long, this leaves
   only 41 octets for upper-layer protocols, like UDP.  The latter uses
   8 octets in the header which leaves only 33 octets for application
   data.  Additionally, as pointed out above, there is a need for a
   fragmentation and reassembly layer, which will use even more octets.

   The above considerations lead to the following two observations:

   1.  The adaptation layer must be provided to comply with the IPv6
       requirements of a minimum MTU.  However, it is expected that (a)
       most applications of IEEE 802.15.4 will not use such large
       packets, and (b) small application payloads in conjunction with
       the proper header compression will produce packets that fit
       within a single IEEE 802.15.4 frame.  The justification for this
       adaptation layer is not just for IPv6 compliance, as it is quite
       likely that the packet sizes produced by certain application
       exchanges (e.g., configuration or provisioning) may require a
       small number of fragments.

   2.  Even though the above space calculation shows the worst-case
       scenario, it does point out the fact that header compression is
       compelling to the point of almost being unavoidable.  Since we

   The encapsulation formats defined in this section (subsequently
   referred to as the "LoWPAN encapsulation") are the payload in the
   IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol data unit (PDU).  The LoWPAN payload
   (e.g., an IPv6 packet) follows this encapsulation header.

   All LoWPAN encapsulated datagrams transported over IEEE 802.15.4 are
   prefixed by an encapsulation header stack.  Each header in the header
   stack contains a header type followed by zero or more header fields.
   Whereas in an IPv6 header the stack would contain, in the following
   order, addressing, hop-by-hop options, routing, fragmentation,
   destination options, and finally payload [<a href="rfc2460.html" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>]; in a LoWPAN
   header, the analogous header sequence is mesh (L2) addressing, hop-
   by-hop options (including L2 broadcast/multicast), fragmentation, and
   finally payload.  These examples show typical header stacks that may
   be used in a LoWPAN network.

   When more than one LoWPAN header is used in the same packet, they
   MUST appear in the following order:

      Mesh Addressing Header

      Broadcast Header

      Fragmentation Header

   All protocol datagrams (e.g., IPv6, compressed IPv6 headers, etc.)
   SHALL be preceded by one of the valid LoWPAN encapsulation headers,
   examples of which are given above.  This permits uniform software
   treatment of datagrams without regard to the mode of their
   transmission.

   The definition of LoWPAN headers, other than mesh addressing and
   fragmentation, consists of the dispatch value, the definition of the
   header fields that follow, and their ordering constraints relative to
   all other headers.  Although the header stack structure provides a
   mechanism to address future demands on the LoWPAN adaptation layer,
   it is not intended to provided general purpose extensibility.  This
   format document specifies a small set of header types using the
   header stack for clarity, compactness, and orthogonality.

   The dispatch value may be treated as an unstructured namespace.  Only
   a few symbols are required to represent current LoWPAN functionality.
   Although some additional savings could be achieved by encoding
   additional functionality into the dispatch byte, these measures would
   tend to constrain the ability to address future alternatives.

   Field definitions are as follows:

   V: This 1-bit field SHALL be zero if the Originator (or "Very first")
      Address is an IEEE extended 64-bit address (EUI-64), or 1 if it is
      a short 16-bit addresses.

   F: This 1-bit field SHALL be zero if the Final Destination Address is
      an IEEE extended 64-bit address (EUI-64), or 1 if it is a short
      16-bit addresses.

   Hops Left:  This 4-bit field SHALL be decremented by each forwarding
      node before sending this packet towards its next hop.  The packet
      is not forwarded any further if Hops Left is decremented to zero.
      The value 0xF is reserved and signifies an 8-bit Deep Hops Left
      field immediately following, and allows a source node to specify a
      hop limit greater than 14 hops.

   Originator Address:  This is the link-layer address of the
      Originator.

   Final Destination Address:  This is the link-layer address of the
      Final Destination.

   Note that the 'V' and 'F' bits allow for a mix of 16 and 64-bit
   addresses.  This is useful at least to allow for mesh layer
   "broadcast", as 802.15.4 broadcast addresses are defined as 16-bit
   short addresses.

   datagram_size:  This 11-bit field encodes the size of the entire IP
      packet before link-layer fragmentation (but after IP layer
      fragmentation).  The value of datagram_size SHALL be the same for
      all link-layer fragments of an IP packet.  For IPv6, this SHALL be
      40 octets (the size of the uncompressed IPv6 header) more than the
      value of Payload Length in the IPv6 header [<a href="rfc2460.html" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>] of the
      packet.  Note that this packet may already be fragmented by hosts
      involved in the communication, i.e., this field needs to encode a
      maximum length of 1280 octets (the IEEE 802.15.4 link MTU, as
      defined in this document).

      NOTE: This field does not need to be in every packet, as one could
      send it with the first fragment and elide it subsequently.
      However, including it in every link fragment eases the task of
      reassembly in the event that a second (or subsequent) link

      fragment arrives before the first.  In this case, the guarantee of
      learning the datagram_size as soon as any of the fragments arrives
      tells the receiver how much buffer space to set aside as it waits
      for the rest of the fragments.  The format above trades off
      simplicity for efficiency.

   datagram_tag:  The value of datagram_tag (datagram tag) SHALL be the
      same for all link fragments of a payload (e.g., IPv6) datagram.
      The sender SHALL increment datagram_tag for successive, fragmented
      datagrams.  The incremented value of datagram_tag SHALL wrap from
      65535 back to zero.  This field is 16 bits long, and its initial
      value is not defined.

   datagram_offset:  This field is present only in the second and
      subsequent link fragments and SHALL specify the offset, in
      increments of 8 octets, of the fragment from the beginning of the
      payload datagram.  The first octet of the datagram (e.g., the
      start of the IPv6 header) has an offset of zero; the implicit
      value of datagram_offset in the first link fragment is zero.  This
      field is 8 bits long.

   The recipient of link fragments SHALL use (1) the sender's 802.15.4
   source address (or the Originator Address if a Mesh Addressing field
   is present), (2) the destination's 802.15.4 address (or the Final
   Destination address if a Mesh Addressing field is present), (3)
   datagram_size, and (4) datagram_tag to identify all the link
   fragments that belong to a given datagram.

   Upon receipt of a link fragment, the recipient starts constructing
   the original unfragmented packet whose size is datagram_size.  It
   uses the datagram_offset field to determine the location of the
   individual fragments within the original unfragmented packet.  For
   example, it may place the data payload (except the encapsulation
   header) within a payload datagram reassembly buffer at the location
   specified by datagram_offset.  The size of the reassembly buffer
   SHALL be determined from datagram_size.

   If a link fragment that overlaps another fragment is received, as
   identified above, and differs in either the size or datagram_offset
   of the overlapped fragment, the fragment(s) already accumulated in
   the reassembly buffer SHALL be discarded.  A fresh reassembly may be
   commenced with the most recently received link fragment.  Fragment
   overlap is determined by the combination of datagram_offset from the
   encapsulation header and "Frame Length" from the 802.15.4 Physical
   Layer Protocol Data Unit (PPDU) packet header.

   reassembled payload datagrams, and fragment senders MUST discard all
   not yet transmitted link fragments of all partially transmitted
   payload (e.g., IPv6) datagrams.  Similarly, when a node first
   receives a fragment with a given datagram_tag, it starts a reassembly

   reassembled, the existing fragments MUST be discarded and the
   reassembly state MUST be flushed.  The reassembly timeout MUST be set

   This section defines how to obtain an IPv6 interface identifier.

   The Interface Identifier [<a href="rfc4291.html" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>RFC4291</a>] for an IEEE 802.15.4 interface may
   be based on the EUI-64 identifier [<a href="#ref-EUI64" title='"GUIDELINES FOR 64-BIT GLOBAL IDENTIFIER (EUI-64) REGISTRATION AUTHORITY"'>EUI64</a>] assigned to the IEEE
   802.15.4 device.  In this case, the Interface Identifier is formed
   from the EUI-64 according to the "IPv6 over Ethernet" specification
   [<a href="rfc2464.html" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks"'>RFC2464</a>].

   All 802.15.4 devices have an IEEE EUI-64 address, but 16-bit short
   addresses (<a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> and <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>) are also possible.  In these
   cases, a "pseudo 48-bit address" is formed as follows.  First, the
   left-most 32 bits are formed by concatenating 16 zero bits to the 16-
   bit PAN ID (alternatively, if no PAN ID is known, 16 zero bits may be
   used).  This produces a 32-bit field as follows:

      16_bit_PAN:16_zero_bits

   Then, these 32 bits are concatenated with the 16-bit short address.
   This produces a 48-bit address as follows:

      32_bits_as_specified_previously:16_bit_short_address

   The interface identifier is formed from this 48-bit address as per
   the "IPv6 over Ethernet" specification [<a href="rfc2464.html" title='"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks"'>RFC2464</a>].  However, in the
   resultant interface identifier, the "Universal/Local" (U/L) bit SHALL
   be set to zero in keeping with the fact that this is not a globally
   unique value.  For either address format, all zero addresses MUST NOT
   be used.

   A different MAC address set manually or by software MAY be used to
   derive the Interface Identifier.  If such a MAC address is used, its
   global uniqueness property should be reflected in the value of the
   U/L bit.

   An IPv6 address prefix used for stateless autoconfiguration [<a href="rfc4862.html" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>RFC4862</a>]
   of an IEEE 802.15.4 interface MUST have a length of 64 bits.

   The functionality in this section MUST only be used in a mesh-enabled
   LoWPAN.  An IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address (DST),
   consisting of the sixteen octets DST[1] through DST[16], is
   transmitted to the following 802.15.4 16-bit multicast address:

                       0                   1
                       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

                                 Figure 8

   Here, DST[15]* refers to the last 5 bits in octet DST[15], that is,
   bits 3-7 within DST[15].  The initial 3-bit pattern of "100" follows
   the 16-bit address format for multicast addresses (<a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>).

   This allows for multicast support within 6LoWPAN networks, but the
   full specification of such support is out of the scope of this
   document.  Example mechanisms are: flooding, controlled flooding,
   unicasting to the PAN coordinator, etc.  It is expected that this
   would be specified by the different mesh routing mechanisms.

   There is much published and in-progress standardization work on
   header compression.  Nevertheless, header compression for IPv6 over
   IEEE 802.15.4 has differing constraints summarized as follows:

      Existing work assumes that there are many flows between any two
      devices.  Here, we assume a very simple and low-context flavor of
      header compression.  Whereas this works independently of flows
      (potentially several), it does not use any context specific to any
      flow.  Thus, it cannot achieve as much compression as schemes that
      build a separate context for each flow to be compressed.

      Given the very limited packet sizes, it is highly desirable to
      integrate layer 2 with layer 3 compression, something
      traditionally not done (although now changing due to the ROHC
      (RObust Header Compression) working group).




<span class="grey">Montenegro, et al.          Standards Track                    [Page 16]</span></pre>

      It is expected that IEEE 802.15.4 devices will be deployed in
      multi-hop networks.  However, header compression in a mesh departs
      from the usual point-to-point link scenario in which the
      compressor and decompressor are in direct and exclusive
      communication with each other.  In an IEEE 802.15.4 network, it is
      highly desirable for a device to be able to send header compressed
      packets via any of its neighbors, with as little preliminary
      context-building as possible.

   Any new packet formats required by header compression reuse the basic
   packet formats defined in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> by using different dispatch
   values.

   Header compression may result in alignment not falling on an octet
   boundary.  Since hardware typically cannot transmit data in units
   less than an octet, padding must be used.  Padding is done as
   follows: First, the entire series of contiguous compressed headers is
   laid out (this document only defines IPv6 and UDP header compression
   schemes, but others may be defined elsewhere).  Then, zero bits
   SHOULD be added as appropriate to align to an octet boundary.  This
   counteracts any potential misalignment caused by header compression,
   so subsequent fields (e.g., non-compressed headers or data payloads)
   start on an octet boundary and follow as usual.

   By virtue of having joined the same 6LoWPAN network, devices share
   some state.  This makes it possible to compress headers without
   explicitly building any compression context state.  Therefore,
   6LoWPAN header compression does not keep any flow state; instead, it
   relies on information pertaining to the entire link.  The following
   IPv6 header values are expected to be common on 6LoWPAN networks, so
   the HC1 header has been constructed to efficiently compress them from
   the onset: Version is IPv6; both IPv6 source and destination
   addresses are link local; the IPv6 interface identifiers (bottom 64
   bits) for the source or destination addresses can be inferred from
   the layer two source and destination addresses (of course, this is
   only possible for interface identifiers derived from an underlying
   802.15.4 MAC address); the packet length can be inferred either from
   layer two ("Frame Length" in the IEEE 802.15.4 PPDU) or from the
   "datagram_size" field in the fragment header (if present); both the
   Traffic Class and the Flow Label are zero; and the Next Header is
   UDP, ICMP or TCP.  The only field in the IPv6 header that always
   needs to be carried in full is the Hop Limit (8 bits).  Depending on
   how closely the packet matches this common case, different fields may
   not be compressible thus needing to be carried "in-line" as well
   (<a href="#section-10.3.1">Section 10.3.1</a>).  This common IPv6 header (as mentioned above) can
   be compressed to 2 octets (1 octet for the HC1 encoding and 1 octet

         Figure 9: LOWPAN_HC1 (common compressed header encoding)

   As can be seen below (bit 7), an HC2 encoding may follow an HC1
   octet.  In this case, the non-compressed fields follow the HC2
   encoding field (<a href="#section-10.3">Section 10.3</a>).

   The address fields encoded by "HC1 encoding" are interpreted as
   follows:

      PI:  Prefix carried in-line (<a href="#section-10.3.1">Section 10.3.1</a>).

      PC:  Prefix compressed (link-local prefix assumed).

      II:  Interface identifier carried in-line (<a href="#section-10.3.1">Section 10.3.1</a>).

      IC:  Interface identifier elided (derivable from the corresponding
         link-layer address).  If applied to the interface identifier of
         either the source or destination address when routing in a mesh
         (<a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>), the corresponding link-layer address is that
         found in the "Mesh Addressing" field (<a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>).

   The "HC1 encoding" is shown below (starting with bit 0 and ending at
   bit 7):

            of the possible HC2 encodings apply (e.g., UDP, ICMP, or TCP

   Bits 5 and 6 of the LOWPAN_HC1 allows compressing the Next Header
   field in the IPv6 header (for UDP, TCP, and ICMP).  Further
   compression of each of these protocol headers is also possible.  This
   section explains how the UDP header itself may be compressed.  The
   HC2 encoding in this section is the HC_UDP encoding, and it only
   applies if bits 5 and 6 in HC1 indicate that the protocol that
   follows the IPv6 header is UDP.  The HC_UDP encoding (Figure 10)
   allows compressing the following fields in the UDP header: source
   port, destination port, and length.  The UDP header's checksum field
   is not compressed and is therefore carried in full.  The scheme

         Figure 10: HC_UDP (UDP common compressed header encoding)

   The "HC_UDP encoding" for UDP is shown below (starting with bit 0 and

      UDP source port (bit 0):

         0: Not compressed, carried "in-line" (<a href="#section-10.3.2">Section 10.3.2</a>)

         1: Compressed to 4 bits.  The actual 16-bit source port is
            obtained by calculating: P + short_port value.  The value of
            P is the number 61616 (0xF0B0).  The short_port is expressed
            as a 4-bit value which is carried "in-line" (<a href="#section-10.3.2">Section 10.3.2</a>)

      UDP destination port (bit 1):

         0: Not compressed, carried "in-line" (<a href="#section-10.3.2">Section 10.3.2</a>)

         1: Compressed to 4 bits.  The actual 16-bit destination port is

            the Payload Length from the IPv6 header, minus the length of

   This scheme allows the IPv6 header to be compressed to different
   degrees.  Hence, instead of the entire (standard) IPv6 header, only
   non-compressed fields need to be sent.  The subsequent header (as
   specified by the Next Header field in the original IPv6 header)
   immediately follows the IPv6 non-compressed fields.

   Uncompressed IPv6 addressing is described by a dispatch type
   containing an IPv6 dispatch value followed by the uncompressed IPv6
   header.  This dispatch type may be preceded by additional LoWPAN
   headers.

   The non-compressed IPv6 field that MUST be always present is the Hop
   Limit (8 bits).  This field MUST always follow the encoding fields
   (e.g., "HC1 encoding" as shown in Figure 9), perhaps including other
   future encoding fields).  Other non-compressed fields MUST follow the
   Hop Limit as implied by the "HC1 encoding" in the exact same order as
   shown above (<a href="#section-10.1">Section 10.1</a>): source address prefix (64 bits) and/or
   interface identifier (64 bits), destination address prefix (64 bits)
   and/or interface identifier (64 bits), Traffic Class (8 bits), Flow
   Label (20 bits) and Next Header (8 bits).  The actual next header
   (e.g., UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc) follows the non-compressed fields.

   This scheme allows the UDP header to be compressed to different
   degrees.  Hence, instead of the entire (standard) UDP header, only
   non-compressed or partially compressed fields need to be sent.

   The non-compressed or partially compressed fields in the UDP header
   MUST always follow the IPv6 header and any of its associated in-line
   fields.  Any UDP header in-line fields present MUST appear in the
   same order as the corresponding fields appear in a normal UDP header
   [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0768" title='"User Datagram Protocol"'>RFC0768</a>], e.g., source port, destination port, length, and checksum.
   If either the source or destination ports are in "short_port"
   notation (as indicated in the compressed UDP header), then instead of
   taking 16 bits, the inline port numbers take 4 bits.

   Even though 802.15.4 networks are expected to commonly use mesh

   define such capability.  In such cases, Full Function Devices (FFDs)
   run an ad hoc or mesh routing protocol to populate their routing
   tables (outside the scope of this document).  In such mesh scenarios,

   two devices do not require direct reachability in order to
   communicate.  Of these devices, the sender is known as the
   "Originator", and the receiver is known as the "Final Destination".
   An originator device may use other intermediate devices as forwarders
   towards the final destination.  In order to achieve such frame
   delivery using unicast, it is necessary to include the link-layer
   addresses of the originator and final destinations, in addition to
   the hop-by-hop source and destination.

   This section defines how to effect delivery of layer 2 frames in a
   mesh, given a target "Final Destination" link-layer address.

   Mesh delivery is enabled by including a Mesh Addressing header prior
   to any other headers of the LoWPAN encapsulation (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>), an
   unfragmented and fragmented header; a full-blown IPv6 header; or a
   compressed IPv6 header as per <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> or any others defined
   elsewhere.

   If a node wishes to use a default mesh forwarder to deliver a packet
   (i.e., because it does not have direct reachability to the
   destination), it MUST include a Mesh Addressing header with the
   originator's link-layer address set to its own, and the final
   destination's link-layer address set to the packet's ultimate
   destination.  It sets the source address in the 802.15.4 header to
   its own link-layer address, and puts the forwarder's link-layer
   address in the 802.15.4 header's destination address field.  Finally,
   it transmits the packet.

   Similarly, if a node receives a frame with a Mesh Addressing header,
   it must look at the Mesh Addressing header's "Final Destination"
   field to determine the real destination.  If the node is itself the
   final destination, it consumes the packet as per normal delivery.  If
   it is not the final destination, the device then reduces the "Hops
   Left" field, and if the result is zero, discards the packet.
   Otherwise, the node consults its link-layer routing table, determines
   what the next hop towards the final destination should be, and puts
   that address in the destination address field of the 802.15.4 header.
   Finally, the node changes the source address in the 802.15.4 header
   to its own link-layer address and transmits the packet.

   Whereas a node must participate in a mesh routing protocol to be a
   forwarder, no such requirement exists for simply using mesh
   forwarding.  Only "Full Function Devices" (FFDs) are expected to
   participate as routers in a mesh.  "Reduced Function Devices" (RFDs)
   limit themselves to discovering FFDs and using them for all their
   forwarding, in a manner similar to how IP hosts typically use default
   routers to forward all their off-link traffic.  For an RFD using mesh
   delivery, the "forwarder" is always the appropriate FFD.

   Additional mesh routing functionality is encoded using a routing
   header immediately following the Mesh header.  In particular, a
   broadcast header consists of a LOWPAN_BC0 dispatch followed by a
   sequence number field.  The sequence number is used to detect
   duplicate packets (and hopefully suppress them).

   Field definitions are as follows:

   Sequence Number:  This 8-bit field SHALL be incremented by the
      originator whenever it sends a new mesh broadcast or multicast
      packet.  Full specification of how to handle this field is out of
      the scope of this document.

   Further implications of such mesh-layer broadcast, e.g., whether it
   maps to a controlled flooding mechanism or its role in, say, topology
   discovery, is out of the scope of this document.

   Additional mesh routing capabilities, such as specifying the mesh
   routing protocol, source routing, and so on may be expressed by
   defining additional routing headers that precede the fragmentation or
   addressing header in the header stack.  The full specification of
   such mesh routing capabilities are out of the scope of this document.

   The method of derivation of Interface Identifiers from EUI-64 MAC
   addresses is intended to preserve global uniqueness when possible.
   However, there is no protection from duplication through accident or
   forgery.

   Neighbor Discovery in IEEE 802.15.4 links may be susceptible to
   threats as detailed in [<a href="rfc3756.html" title='"IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats"'>RFC3756</a>].  Mesh routing is expected to be
   common in IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  This implies additional threats
   due to ad hoc routing as per [<a href="#ref-KW03" title='"Secure Routing in Sensor Networks: Attacks and Countermeasures"'>KW03</a>].  IEEE 802.15.4 provides some
   capability for link-layer security.  Users are urged to make use of
   such provisions if at all possible and practical.  Doing so will
   alleviate the threats stated above.

   A sizeable portion of IEEE 802.15.4 devices is expected to always
   communicate within their PAN (i.e., within their link, in IPv6
   terms).  In response to cost and power consumption considerations,
   and in keeping with the IEEE 802.15.4 model of "Reduced Function
   Devices" (RFDs), these devices will typically implement the minimum
   set of features necessary.  Accordingly, security for such devices
   may rely quite strongly on the mechanisms defined at the link layer
   by IEEE 802.15.4.  The latter, however, only defines the Advanced
   Encryption Standard (AES) modes for authentication or encryption of
   IEEE 802.15.4 frames, and does not, in particular, specify key
   management (presumably group oriented).  Other issues to address in
   real deployments relate to secure configuration and management.
   Whereas such a complete picture is out of the scope of this document,
   it is imperative that IEEE 802.15.4 networks be deployed with such
   considerations in mind.  Of course, it is also expected that some
   IEEE 802.15.4 devices (the so-called "Full Function Devices", or
   "FFDs") will implement coordination or integration functions.  These
   may communicate regularly with off-link IPv6 peers (in addition to
   the more common on-link exchanges).  Such IPv6 devices are expected
   to secure their end-to-end communications with the usual mechanisms
   (e.g., IPsec, TLS, etc).

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4944.html">RFC 4944</a>                IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4           September 2007</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Alternatives%20for%20Delivery%20of%20Frames%20in%20a%20Mesh"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" name="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Alternatives for Delivery of Frames in a Mesh</span>

   Before settling on the mechanism finally adopted for delivery in a
   mesh (<a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>), several alternatives were considered.  In addition
   to the hop-by-hop source and destination link-layer addresses,
   delivering a packet in a LoWPAN mesh requires the end-to-end
   originator and destination addresses.  These could be expressed
   either as layer 2 or as layer 3 (i.e., IP ) addresses.  In the latter
   case, there would be no need to provide any additional header support
   in this document (i.e., within the LoWPAN header itself).  The link-
   layer destination address would point to the next hop destination
   address while the IP header destination address would point to the
   final destination (IP) address (possibly multiple hops away from the
   source), and similarly for the source addresses.  Thus, while
   forwarding data, the single-hop source and destination addresses
   would change at each hop (always pointing to the node doing the
   forwarding and the "best" next link-layer hop, respectively), while
   the source and destination IP addresses would remain unchanged.
   Notice that if an IP packet is fragmented, the individual fragments
   may arrive at any node out of order.  If the initial fragment (which
   contains the IP header) is delayed for some reason, a node that
   receives a subsequent fragment would lack the required information.
   It would be forced to wait until it receives the IP header (within
   the first fragment) before being able to forward the fragment any
   further.  This imposes some additional buffering requirements on
   intermediate nodes.  Additionally, such a specification would only
   work for one type of LoWPAN payload: IPv6.  In general, it would have
   to be adapted for any other payload, and would require that payload
   to provide its own end-to-end addressing information.

   On the other hand, the approach finally followed (<a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>) creates
   a mesh at the LoWPAN layer (below layer 3).  Accordingly, the link-
   layer originator and final destination address are included within
   the LoWPAN header.  This enables mesh delivery for any protocol or
   application layered on the LoWPAN adaptation layer (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>).  For
   IPv6 as supported in this document, another advantage of expressing
   the originator and final destinations as layer 2 addresses is that
   the IPv6 addresses can be compressed as per the header compression
   specified in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.  Furthermore, the number of octets needed to
   maintain routing tables is reduced due to the smaller size of
   802.15.4 addresses (either 64 bits or 16 bits) as compared to IPv6
   addresses (128 bits).  A disadvantage is that applications on top of
   IP do not address packets to link-layer destination addresses, but to
   IP (layer 3) destination addresses.  Thus, given an IP address, there
   is a need to resolve the corresponding link-layer address.
   Accordingly, a mesh routing specification needs to clarify the
   Neighbor Discovery implications, although in some special cases, it
   may be possible to derive a device's address at layer 2 from its
