<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20The%20Network%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  The Network Management Framework</span>

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

   <a href="rfc1902.html">RFC 1902</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>1</a>] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
   describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

   <a href="rfc1213.html">RFC 1213</a>, STD 17, [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>3</a>] which defines MIB-II, the core set of
   managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   <a href="rfc1905.html">RFC 1905</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Protocol Operations for version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>4</a>] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
   network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Within a given MIB module,
   objects are defined using the SMI's OBJECT-TYPE macro.  At a minimum,
   each object has a name, a syntax, an access-level, and an
   implementation-status.

   The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name,
   which specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
   object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
   of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
   termed the object descriptor, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 [<a href="#ref-6" title="(December">6</a>] language is used
   for this purpose.  However, <a href="rfc1902.html">RFC 1902</a> purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The access-level of an object type defines whether it makes "protocol
   sense" to read and/or write the value of an instance of the object
   type.  (This access-level is independent of any administrative
   authorization policy.)

   The implementation-status of an object type indicates whether the
   object is mandatory, optional, obsolete, or deprecated.

   This document continues the architecture created in the RMON MIB [RFC
   1757] by providing a major feature upgrade, primarily by providing
   RMON analysis up to the application layer.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2021.html">RFC 2021</a>             Remote Network Monitoring MIB          January 1997</span>


   Remote network monitoring devices, often called monitors or probes,
   are instruments that exist for the purpose of managing a network.
   Often these remote probes are stand-alone devices and devote
   significant internal resources for the sole purpose of managing a
   network.  An organization may employ many of these devices, one per
   network segment, to manage its internet.  In addition, these devices
   may be used for a network management service provider to access a
   client network, often geographically remote.

   The objects defined in this document are intended as an interface
   between an RMON agent and an RMON management application and are not
   intended for direct manipulation by humans.  While some users may
   tolerate the direct display of some of these objects, few will
   tolerate the complexity of manually manipulating objects to
   accomplish row creation.  These functions should be handled by the
   management application.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Remote%20Network%20Management%20Goals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Remote Network Management Goals</span>

    o Offline Operation
        There are sometimes conditions when a management
        station will not be in constant contact with its
        remote monitoring devices.  This is sometimes by
        design in an attempt to lower communications costs
        (especially when communicating over a WAN or
        dialup link), or by accident as network failures
        affect the communications between the management
        station and the probe.

        For this reason, this MIB allows a probe to be
        configured to perform diagnostics and to collect
        statistics continuously, even when communication with
        the management station may not be possible or
        efficient.  The probe may then attempt to notify
        the management station when an exceptional condition
        occurs.  Thus, even in circumstances where
        communication between management station and probe is
        not continuous, fault, performance, and configuration
        information may be continuously accumulated and
        communicated to the management station conveniently
        and efficiently.

    o Proactive Monitoring
        Given the resources available on the monitor, it
        is potentially helpful for it continuously to run
        diagnostics and to log network performance.  The
        monitor is always available at the onset of any
        failure.  It can notify the management station of the
        failure and can store historical statistical
        information about the failure.  This historical
        information can be played back by the management
        station in an attempt to perform further diagnosis
        into the cause of the problem.

    o Problem Detection and Reporting
        The monitor can be configured to recognize
        conditions, most notably error conditions, and
        continuously to check for them.  When one of these
        conditions occurs, the event may be logged, and
        management stations may be notified in a number of
        ways.

    o Value Added Data
        Because a remote monitoring device represents a
        network resource dedicated exclusively to network
        management functions, and because it is located
        directly on the monitored portion of the network, the
        remote network monitoring device has the opportunity
        to add significant value to the data it collects.
        For instance, by highlighting those hosts on the
        network that generate the most traffic or errors, the
        probe can give the management station precisely the
        information it needs to solve a class of problems.

    o Multiple Managers
        An organization may have multiple management stations
        for different units of the organization, for different
        functions (e.g. engineering and operations), and in an
        attempt to provide disaster recovery.  Because
        environments with multiple management stations are
        common, the remote network monitoring device has to
        deal with more than own management station,
        potentially using its resources concurrently.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Structure%20of%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Structure of MIB</span>

   The objects are arranged into the following groups:

        - protocol directory

        - protocol distribution

        - address mapping

        - network layer host

        - network layer matrix

        - application layer host

        - application layer matrix

        - user history

        - probe configuration

   These groups are the basic units of conformance.  If a remote
   monitoring device implements a group, then it must implement all
   objects in that group.  For example, a managed agent that implements
   the network layer matrix group must implement the nlMatrixSDTable and
   the nlMatrixDSTable.

   Implementations of this MIB must also implement the system and
   interfaces group of MIB-II [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>3</a>].  MIB-II may also mandate the
   implementation of additional groups.

   These groups are defined to provide a means of assigning object
   identifiers, and to provide a method for managed agents to know which
   objects they must implement.

   This document also contains enhancements to tables defined in the
   RMON MIB [<a href="rfc1757.html">RFC 1757</a>].  These enhancements include:

    1) Adding the DroppedFrames and LastCreateTime
       conventions to each table defined in the RMON MIB.

    2) Augmenting the RMON filter table with a mechanism
       that allows filtering based on an offset from the
       beginning of a particular protocol, even if the
       protocol headers are variable length.

    3) Augmenting the RMON filter and capture status bits
       with additional bits for WAN media and generic media.
       These bits are defined here as:

        Bit     Definition
        6       For WAN media, this bit is set for packets
                coming from one direction and cleared for
                packets coming from the other direction.
                It is an implementation specific matter
                as to which bit is assigned to which
                direction, but it must be consistent for
                all packets received by the agent, and if
                the agent knows which end of the link is
                "local" and which end is "network", the bit
                should be set for packets from the "local"
                side and should be cleared for packets from
                the "network" side.

        7       For any media, this bit is set for any packet
                with a physical layer error. This bit may be
                set in addition to other media-specific bits
                that denote the same condition.

        8       For any media, this bit is set for any packet
                that is too short for the media. This bit may
                be set in addition to other media-specific
                bits that denote the same condition.
        9       For any media, this bit is set for any packet
                that is too long for the media. This bit may
                be set in addition to other media-specific bits
                that denote the same condition.

   These enhancements are implemented by RMON-2 probes that also
   implement RMON and do not add any requirements to probes that are
   compliant to just RMON.

   Due to the complex nature of the available functions in these
   devices, the functions often need user configuration.  In many cases,
   the function requires parameters to be set up for a data collection
   operation.  The operation can proceed only after these parameters are
   fully set up.

   Many functional groups in this MIB have one or more tables in which
   to set up control parameters, and one or more data tables in which to
   place the results of the operation.  The control tables are typically
   read/write in nature, while the data tables are typically read/only.



<span class="grey">Waldbusser                  Standards Track                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

   Because the parameters in the control table often describe resulting
   data in the data table, many of the parameters can be modified only
   when the control entry is not active.  Thus, the method for modifying
   these parameters is to de-activate the entry, perform the SNMP Set
   operations to modify the entry, and then re-activate the entry.
   Deleting the control entry causes the deletion of any associated data
   entries, which also gives a convenient method for reclaiming the
   resources used by the associated data.

   Some objects in this MIB provide a mechanism to execute an action on
   the remote monitoring device.  These objects may execute an action as
   a result of a change in the state of the object.  For those objects
   in this MIB, a request to set an object to the same value as it
   currently holds would thus cause no action to occur.

   To facilitate control by multiple managers, resources have to be
   shared among the managers.  These resources are typically the memory
   and computation resources that a function requires.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Resource%20Sharing%20Among%20Multiple%20Management%20Stations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Resource Sharing Among Multiple Management Stations</span>

   When multiple management stations wish to use functions that compete
   for a finite amount of resources on a device, a method to facilitate
   this sharing of resources is required.  Potential conflicts include:

    o Two management stations wish to simultaneously use
      resources that together would exceed the capability of
      the device.
    o A management station uses a significant amount of
      resources for a long period of time.
    o A management station uses resources and then crashes,
      forgetting to free the resources so others may
      use them.

   The OwnerString mechanism is provided for each management station
   initiated function in this MIB to avoid these conflicts and to help
   resolve them when they occur.  Each function has a label identifying
   the initiator (owner) of the function.  This label is set by the
   initiator to provide for the following possibilities:

    o A management station may recognize resources it owns
      and no longer needs.
    o A network operator can find the management station that
      owns the resource and negotiate for it to be freed.
    o A network operator may decide to unilaterally free
      resources another network operator has reserved.





<span class="grey">Waldbusser                  Standards Track                     [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-8" id="page-8" name="page-8"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2021.html">RFC 2021</a>             Remote Network Monitoring MIB          January 1997</span>


    o Upon initialization, a management station may recognize
      resources it had reserved in the past.  With this
      information it may free the resources if it no longer
      needs them.

   Management stations and probes should support any format of the owner
   string dictated by the local policy of the organization.  It is
   suggested that this name contain one or more of the following: IP
   address, management station name, network manager's name, location,
   or phone number.  This information will help users to share the
   resources more effectively.

   There is often default functionality that the device or the
   administrator of the probe (often the network administrator) wishes
   to set up.  The resources associated with this functionality are then
   owned by the device itself or by the network administrator, and are
   intended to be long-lived.  In this case, the device or the
   administrator will set the relevant owner object to a string starting
   with 'monitor'.  Indiscriminate modification of the monitor-owned
   configuration by network management stations is discouraged.  In
   fact, a network management station should only modify these objects
   under the direction of the administrator of the probe.

   Resources on a probe are scarce and are typically allocated when
   control rows are created by an application.  Since many applications
   may be using a probe simultaneously, indiscriminate allocation of
   resources to particular applications is very likely to cause resource
   shortages in the probe.

   When a network management station wishes to utilize a function in a
   monitor, it is encouraged to first scan the control table of that
   function to find an instance with similar parameters to share.  This
   is especially true for those instances owned by the monitor, which
   can be assumed to change infrequently.  If a management station
   decides to share an instance owned by another management station, it
   should understand that the management station that owns the instance
   may indiscriminately modify or delete it.

   It should be noted that a management application should have the most
   trust in a monitor-owned row because it should be changed very
   infrequently.  A row owned by the management application is less
   long-lived because a network administrator is more likely to re-
   assign resources from a row that is in use by one user than from a
   monitor-owned row that is potentially in use by many users.  A row
   owned by another application would be even less long-lived because
   the other application may delete or modify that row completely at its
   discretion.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Row%20Addition%20Among%20Multiple%20Management%20Stations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Row Addition Among Multiple Management Stations</span>

   The addition of new rows is achieved using the RowStatus method
   described in <a href="rfc1903.html">RFC 1903</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Textual Conventions for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>].  In this MIB, rows are often added to a
   table in order to configure a function.  This configuration usually
   involves parameters that control the operation of the function.  The
   agent must check these parameters to make sure they are appropriate
   given restrictions defined in this MIB as well as any implementation
   specific restrictions such as lack of resources.  The agent
   implementor may be confused as to when to check these parameters and
   when to signal to the management station that the parameters are
   invalid.  There are two opportunities:

    o When the management station sets each parameter object.

    o When the management station sets the row status object
      to active.

   If the latter is chosen, it would be unclear to the management
   station which of the several parameters was invalid and caused the
   badValue error to be emitted.  Thus, wherever possible, the
   implementor should choose the former as it will provide more
   information to the management station.

   A problem can arise when multiple management stations attempt to set
   configuration information simultaneously using SNMP.  When this
   involves the addition of a new conceptual row in the same control
   table, the managers may collide, attempting to create the same entry.
   To guard against these collisions, each such control entry contains a
   status object with special semantics that help to arbitrate among the
   managers.  If an attempt is made with the row addition mechanism to
   create such a status object and that object already exists, an error
   is returned.  When more than one manager simultaneously attempts to
   create the same conceptual row, only the first will succeed.  The
   others will receive an error.

   In the RMON MIB [<a href="rfc1757.html">RFC 1757</a>], the EntryStatus textual convention was
   introduced to provide this mutual exclusion function.  Since then,
   this function was added to the SNMP framework as the RowStatus
   textual convention.  The RowStatus textual convention is used for the
   definition of all new tables.

   When a manager wishes to create a new control entry, it needs to
   choose an index for that row.  It may choose this index in a variety
   of ways, hopefully minimizing the chances that the index is in use by
   another manager.  If the index is in use, the mechanism mentioned
   previously will guard against collisions.  Examples of schemes to
   choose index values include random selection or scanning the control

   table looking for the first unused index.  Because index values may
   be any valid value in the range and they are chosen by the manager,
   the agent must allow a row to be created with any unused index value
   if it has the resources to create a new row.

   Some tables in this MIB reference other tables within this MIB.  When
   creating or deleting entries in these tables, it is generally
   allowable for dangling references to exist.  There is no defined
   order for creating or deleting entries in these tables.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Conventions</span>

   The following conventions are used throughout the RMON MIB and its
   companion documents.

   Good Packets

   Good packets are error-free packets that have a valid frame length.
   For example, on Ethernet, good packets are error-free packets that
   are between 64 octets long and 1518 octets long.  They follow the
   form defined in IEEE 802.3 <a href="#section-3.2">section 3.2</a>.all.

   Bad Packets

   Bad packets are packets that have proper framing and are therefore
   recognized as packets, but contain errors within the packet or have
   an invalid length.  For example, on Ethernet, bad packets have a
   valid preamble and SFD, but have a bad CRC, or are either shorter
   than 64 octets or longer than 1518 octets.

   The following practices and conventions are introduced in the RMON 2
   MIB.

   There are many cases in this MIB where the term Application Level is
   used to describe a class of protocols or a capability.  This does not
   typically mean a protocol that is an OSI Layer 7 protocol.  Rather,
   it is used to identify a class of protocols that is not limited to
   MAC-layer and network-layer protocols, but can also include
   transport, session, presentation, and application-layer protocols.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Protocol%20Directory%20and%20Limited%20Extensibility"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Protocol Directory and Limited Extensibility</span>

   Every RMON 2 implementation will have the capability to parse certain
   types of packets and identify their protocol type at multiple levels,
   The protocol directory presents an inventory of those protocol types
   the probe is capable of monitoring, and allows the addition,
   deletion, and configuration of protocol types in this list.

   One concept deserves special attention: the "limited extensibility"
   of the protocol directory table.  The RMON 2 model is that protocols
   are detected by static software that has been written at
   implementation time.  Therefore, as a matter of configuration, an
   implementation does not have the ability to suddenly learn how to
   parse new packet types.  However, an implementation may be written
   such that the software knows where the demultiplexing field is for a
   particular protocol, and can be written in such a way that the
   decoding of the next layer up is table-driven.  This works when the
   code has been written to accomodate it and can be extended no more
   than one level higher.  This extensibility is called "limited
   extensibility" to highlight these limitations.  However, this can be
   a very useful tool.

   For example, suppose that an implementation has C code that
   understands how to decode IP packets on any of several ethernet
   encapsulations, and also knows how to interpret the IP protocol field
   to recognize UDP packets and how to decode the UDP port number
   fields.  That implementation may be table- driven so that among the
   many different UDP port numbers possible, it is configured to
   recognize 161 as SNMP, port 53 as DNS, and port 69 as TFTP.  The
   limited extensibility of the protocol directory table would allow an
   SNMP operation to create an entry that would create an additional
   table mapping for UDP that would recognize UDP port 123 as NTP and
   begin counting such packets.

   This limited extensibility is an option that an implementation can
   choose to allow or disallow for any protocol that has child
   protocols.

   Packets with link-level errors are not counted anywhere in this MIB
   because most variables in this MIB requires the decoding of the
   contents of the packet, which is meaningless if there is a link-level
   error.

   Packets in which protocol errors are detected are counted for all
   protocols below the layer in which the error was encountered.  The
   implication of this is that packets in which errors are detected at

    DESCRIPTION
        "This TC describes an object which counts events with the
        following semantics: objects of this type will be set to
        zero(0) on creation and will thereafter count appropriate
        events, wrapping back to zero(0) when the value 2^32 is
        reached.

        "To be used for the index to a table.  Allows an application
        to download only those rows changed since a particular time.
        A row is considered changed if the value of any object in the
        row changes or if the row is created or deleted.

        When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty.

        One entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime, except that
        the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap.

        As this basic row is updated new conceptual rows are created
        (which still share the now updated object values with all
        other instances).  The number of instances which are created
        is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the basic row
        was last updated.  One instance will exist for each value of
        sysUpTime at the last update time for the row.  A new
        timeMark instance is created for each new sysUpTime value.
        Each new conceptual row will be associated with the timeMark
        instance which was created at the value of sysUpTime with
        which the conceptual row is to be associated.

        By definition all conceptual rows were updated at or after
        time zero and so at least one conceptual row (associated with
        timeMark.0) must exist for each underlying (basic) row.

        See the appendix for further discussion of this variable.

        Consider the following fooTable:

        fooTable ...
        INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex }

        FooEntry {
           fooTimeMark  TimeFilter
           fooIndex     INTEGER,
           fooCounts    Counter
        }

        Should there be two basic rows in this table (fooIndex == 1,
        fooIndex == 2) and row 1 was updated most recently at time 6,
        while row 2 was updated most recently at time 8, and both rows
        had been updated on several earlier occasions such that the
        current values were 5 and 9 respectively then the following
        fooCounts instances would exist.

        Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place

        usability), and is up to the designer of the product.

        If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that
        the agent doesn't understand, either directly or

         children of this protocol.

         An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is
         `ip.udp'.  The probe may automatically populate some children
         of this node such as `ip.udp.snmp' and `ip.udp.dns'.
         A probe administrator or user may also populate additional
         children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this
         table.  When a child node is added for a protocol for which the
         probe has no built in support, extending a parent node (for
         which the probe does have built in support),
         that child node is not extendible.  This is termed `limited
         extensibility'.

         When a child node is added through this extensibility
         mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and
         protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent.

         The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the
         manager who is creating the new entry.

         This object also describes whether or not this agent can
         recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network
         level protocol.  That is, while a probe may be able to
         recognize packets of a particular network layer protocol and
         count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize
         the addresses in this protocol and to populate network layer
         or application layer tables with the addresses in this
         protocol.  If this bit is set, the agent will recognize
         network layer addresses for this protoocl and populate the
         network and application layer host and matrix tables with
         these protocols.

         Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply
         values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent
         with respect to this protocol.  Note that since row creations
         usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these

        If the associated protocolDirType object has the
        addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network
        layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and
        thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and
        both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for
        this protocol.

        If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe
        will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the
        alMatrixTables for this protocol and shall not allow this
        object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this
        object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of both
        of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the
        alMatrixTables for this protocol and is configured to track
        these tables for this protocol for all control entries and all
        interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2),
        the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and
        (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol
        but is configured to not track these tables for this
        protocol for any control entries or interfaces.
        Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to
        supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in
        the nlMatrixTables and the alMatrixTables.

        Note that since each alMatrixEntry references 2 protocol
        directory entries, one for the network address and one for the
        type of the highest protocol recognized, that an entry will
        only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3)

-- User History Collection Group (usrHistory)
--
-- The usrHistory group combines mechanisms seen in the alarm and
-- history groups to provide user-specified history collection,
-- utilizing two additional control tables and one additional data
-- table. This function has traditionally been done by NMS
-- applications, via periodic polling.  The usrHistory group allows
-- this task to be offloaded to an RMON probe.
--
-- Data (an ASN.1 INTEGER based object) is collected in the same
-- manner as any history data table (e.g. etherHistoryTable) except
-- that the user specifies the MIB instances to be collected. Objects
-- are collected in bucket-groups, with the intent that all MIB
-- instances in the same bucket-group are collected as atomically as
-- possible by the RMON probe.
--
-- The usrHistoryControlTable is a one-dimensional read-create table.
-- Each row configures a collection of user history buckets, much
-- the same as a historyControlEntry, except that the creation of a
-- row in this table will cause one or more associated instances in
-- the usrHistoryObjectTable to be created. The user specifies the
-- number of bucket elements (rows in the usrHistoryObjectTable)
-- requested, as well as the number of buckets requested.
--
-- The usrHistoryObjectTable is a 2-d read-write table.
-- Each row configures a single MIB instance to be collected.
-- All rows with the same major index constitute a bucket-group.
--
-- The usrHistoryTable is a 3-d read-only table containing
-- the data of associated usrHistoryControlEntries. Each
-- entry represents the value of a single MIB instance
-- during a specific sampling interval (or the rate of
-- change during the interval).
--
-- A sample value is stored in two objects - an absolute value and
-- a status object. This allows numbers from -(2G-1) to +4G to be
-- stored.  The status object also indicates whether a sample is
-- valid. This allows data collection to continue if periodic
-- retrieval of a particular instance fails for any reason.
--
-- Row Creation Order Relationships

    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This data type is used to communicate with a modem or a
        serial data switch.  A ControlString contains embedded
        commands to control how the device will interact with the
        remote device through the serial interface.  Commands are
        represented as two character sequences beginning with
        the `^' character.

        The following commands are recognized by the device (note
        that command characters are case sensitive):

           ^s  Send string that follows which is terminated by the
               next command or the end of string.
           ^c  Delay for the number of seconds that follows.  Toss
               out any data received rather than storing it in a
               buffer for parsing.
           ^t  Set timeout to the value represented by the decimal
               digits that follow.  The default timeout is 20
               seconds. Note that this timeout may be overridden
               by a smaller serialTimeout configured for the

               associated serial interface (see serialConfigTable).
           ^w  Wait for the reply string that follows which is
               terminated by the next command or the end of string.
               Partial and case insensitive matching is applied, ie.
               if the reply string (any case combination) is found
               anywhere in the received string, then the a match is
               found.  If the current timeout elapses without a match,
               then the remaining control string is ignored.
           ^!  The ^ character.
           ^d  Delay the number of seconds specified by the decimal
               digits that follow.
           ^b  Send break for the number of milliseconds specified by
               the decimal digits that follow.  If no digits follow,
               break will be enforced for 250 milliseconds by default.

        The following ASCII control characters may be inserted into
        the `^s' send string or the `^w' reply string:

           ^@    0x00
           ^A    0x01
            ..
           ^M    0x0D
            ..
           ^Z    0x1A
           ^[    0x1B
           ^    0x1C
           ^]    0x1D
           ^^    0x1E
           ^_    0x1F

        Binary data may also be inserted into the data stream.  The
        control sequence for each byte of binary data is ^0x##, where
        ## is the hexadecimal representation of the data byte.  Two
        ASCII characters (0-9, a-f, A-F) must follow the `^0x'
        control prefix.  For example, `^0x0D^0x0A' is interpreted as a
        carriage return followed by a line feed."

   In order to implement this MIB, a probe must capture all packets on
   the locally-attached network, including packets between third
   parties.  These packets are analyzed to collect network addresses,
   protocol usage information, and conversation statistics. Data of this
   nature may be considered sensitive in some environments. In such
   environments the administrator may wish to restrict SNMP access to
   the probe.

   A probe implementing this MIB is likely to also implement RMON
   [<a href="rfc1757.html">RFC1757</a>], which includes functions for returning the contents of
   captured packets, potentially including sensitive user data or
   passwords. It is recommended that SNMP access to these functions be
   restricted.

   1) Theory of Operation

   The TimeFilter mechanism allows an NMS to reduce the number of SNMP
   transactions required for a 'table-update' operation.  Polling of
   tables that incorporate a 'TimeFilter' INDEX can be reduced to a
   theoretical minimum (if used correctly). It can be easily implemented
   by an agent in a way independent of the number of NMS applications
   using the same time-filtered table.

   Although the name 'TimeFilter' may imply that a history of change
   events is maintained by the agent, this is not the case.  A time-
   filtered-value represents the current value of the object instance,
   not the 'saved' value at the time indicated by the TimeFilter INDEX
   value. Note that TimeFilter objects only appear in INDEX clauses
   (always not-accessible), so their value is never retrieved. By
   design, the actual value of a TimeFilter instance is not in itself
   meaningful (it's not a 'last-change-timestamp').

   The TimeFilter is a boolean filtering function applied in internal
   Get* PDU processing. If the 'last-change-time' of the specified
   instance is less than the particular TimeFilter INDEX value, then the
   instance is considered 'not-present' (skipped for GetNext and GetBulk
   PDUs; 'noSuchInstance' or returned to the requester.

1.1) Agent Implementation of a Time-Filtered Table

   In implementation, the time-filtered rows (one for each tick of
   sysUpTime) are only conceptual. The agent simply filters a real table
   based on:
       * the current value of sysUpTime
       * the TimeFilter value passed in the varbind
       * the last-update timestamp of each requested counter
         (agent implementation requirement)

   For example, to implement a time-filtered counter, an agent maintains
   a timestamp in a 32-bit storage location, initialized to zero. This
   is in addition to whatever instrumentation is needed for the counter.

   Each time the counter is updated, the current value of sysUpTime is
   recorded in the associated timestamp. If this is not possible or
   practical, then a background polling process must 'refresh' the
   timestamp by sampling counter values and comparing them to recorded
   samples. The timestamp update must occur within 5 seconds of the
   actual change event.





<span class="grey">Waldbusser                  Standards Track                   [Page 123]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-124" id="page-124" name="page-124"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2021.html">RFC 2021</a>             Remote Network Monitoring MIB          January 1997</span>


   When an agent receives a Get, GetNext, or GetBulk PDU requesting a
   time-filtered instance, the following agent has determined that the
   instance is within the MIB view indicated by the community string in
   the PDU.

       /* return TRUE if the object is present */
       boolean time_filter_test (
           TimeFilter  last_modified_timestamp,
           TimeFilter  index_value_in_pdu )
       {
           if (last_modified_timestamp &lt; index_value_in_pdu)
            return FALSE;
           else
               return TRUE;
       }

   The agent applies this function regardless of the lastActivationTime
   of the conceptual row in question. In other words, counter
   discontinuities are ignored (i.e.  conceptual row deleted and then
   re-created later). An agent should consider a object instance
   'changed' when it is created (either at restart time for scalars and
   static objects, or row-creation-time for dynamic tables).

   Note that using a timeFilter INDEX value of zero removes the
   filtering functionality, as the instance will always be

1.2) NMS Implementation of a Time-Filtered Table

   The particular TimeFilter INDEX values used by an NMS reflect the
   polling interval of the NMS, relative to the particular agent's
   notion of sysUpTime.

   An NMS needs to maintain one timestamp variable per agent
   (initialized to zero) for an arbitrary group of time-filtered MIB
   objects that are gathered together in the same PDU.  Each time the
   Get* PDU is sent, a request for sysUpTime is included. The retrieved
   sysUpTime value is used as the timeFilter value in the next polling
   cycle. If a polling sweep of a time-filtered group of objects
   requires more than one SNMP transaction, then the sysUpTime value
   retrieved in the first GetResponse PDU of the polling sweep is saved
   as the next timeFilter value.

   The actual last-update time of a given object is not indicated in the
   returned GetResponse instance identifier, but rather the timeFilter
   value passed in the Get*Request PDU is returned.

   A "time-filtered get-next/bulk-sweep", done once per polling
   cycle, is a series of GetNext or GetBulk transactions, and is
   over when one of the following events occurs:
     1) the TimeFilter index value returned in the GetResponse is
        different than the TimeFilter index value passed in the
        GetNext or GetBulk request. Counter values will still be
        returned beyond this point (until the last-change-time is
        reached), but most likely the same values will be
   returned.
     2) the return PDU includes instances lexigraphically greater
        than the objects expected (i.e. same GetNext semantics as
        if the TimeFilter wasn't there)
     3) a noSuchName or other exception/error is returned.

   Note that the use of a time-filtered table in combination with a
   GetRequest PDU neutralizes any optimization that otherwise might be
   achieved with the TimeFilter, because no PDU transactions are saved.
   Either the current time-filtered object-value is returned, or a
   'noSuchInstance' exception (SNMPv1c) or 'noSuchName' error (SNMPv1)
   is returned.

   If GetBulk PDUs are used, then the value selected for response PDUs
   generated by the agent, since duplicate entries (one per size. An
appropriate of conceptual rows in the time-filtered table if known, or
   equal to the number of instances expected to fit in a GetResponse PDU
   without causing a 'tooBig' error from the agent.

2) TimeFilter Example

   The following example demonstrates how an NMS and Agent might use a
   table with a TimeFilter object in the INDEX. A static table is
   assumed to keep the example simple, but dynamic tables can also be
   supported.

2.1) General Assumptions

   fooEntry INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIfIndex }
   FooEntry = SEQUENCE {
       fooTimeMark    TimeFilter,
       fooIfIndex     Integer32,
       fooCounts      Counter32
   }

   The NMS polls the fooTable every 15 seconds and the
baseline
   poll occurs when the agent has been up for 6 seconds,
   and the NMS has been up for 10 seconds.

   There are 2 static rows in this table at system
initialization
   (fooCounts.0.1 and fooCounts.0.2).

   Row 1 was updated as follows:
       SysUpTime    fooCounts.*.1 value         500

          2300            3

   Row 2 was updated as follows:
       SysUpTime    fooCounts.*.2 value
          1100            1
          1400            2


2.2) SNMP Transactions from NMS Perspective

   Time nms-1000:
       # NMS baseline poll -- get everything since last agent
restart
       # TimeFilter == 0

       get-bulk(nonRptrs=1, maxReps=2, sysUpTime.0,
            fooCounts.0);
       returns:
          sysUpTime.0 == 600
          fooCounts.0.1 == 1  # incremented at time 500
fooCounts.0.2 == 0  # visible since created at time 0

   Time nms-2500:
       # NMS 1st poll
       # TimeFilter index == 600

       get-bulk(nonRptrs=1, maxReps=2, sysUpTime.0,
            fooCounts.600);
       returns:
          sysUpTime.0 == 2100
          fooCounts.600.1 == 2   # incremented at time 900
       fooCounts.600.2 == 2   # incremented at times 1100 and
1400
          fooCounts.601.1 == 2   # indicates end of sweep
