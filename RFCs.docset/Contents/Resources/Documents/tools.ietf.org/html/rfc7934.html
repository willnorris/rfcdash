   In most aspects, the IPv6 protocol is very similar to IPv4.  This
   similarity can create a tendency to think of IPv6 as 128-bit IPv4,
   and thus lead network designers and operators to apply identical
   configurations and operational practices to both.  This is generally
   a good thing because it eases the transition to IPv6 and the
   operation of dual-stack networks.  However, in some design and
   operational areas, it can lead to carrying over IPv4 practices that
   are limiting or not appropriate in IPv6 due to differences between
   the protocols.

   One such area is IP addressing, particularly IP addressing of hosts.
   This is substantially different because unlike IPv4 addresses, IPv6
   addresses are not a scarce resource.  In IPv6, a single link provides
   over four billion times more address space than the whole IPv4
   Internet [<a href="rfc7421.html" title='"Analysis of the 64-bit Boundary in IPv6 Addressing"'>RFC7421</a>].  Thus, unlike IPv4, IPv6 networks are not forced
   by address scarcity concerns to provide only one address per host.
   Furthermore, providing multiple addresses has many benefits,
   including application functionality and simplicity, privacy, and
   flexibility to accommodate future applications.  Another significant
   benefit is the ability to provide Internet access without the use of
   Network Address Translation (NAT).  Providing only one IPv6 address
   per host negates these benefits.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7934.html">RFC 7934</a>        Host Address Availability Recommendations      July 2016</span>


   This document details the benefits of providing multiple addresses
   per host, and the problems with not doing so.  It recommends that
   networks provide general-purpose end hosts with multiple global
   addresses when they attach and lists current options for doing so.
   It does not specify any changes to protocols or host behavior.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Common%20IPv6%20Deployment%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Common IPv6 Deployment Model</span>

   IPv6 is designed to support multiple addresses, including multiple
   global addresses, per interface (see <a href="rfc4291.html#section-2.1">Section 2.1 of [RFC4291]</a> and
   <a href="rfc6434.html#section-5.9.4">Section 5.9.4 of [RFC6434]</a>).  Today, many general-purpose IPv6 hosts
   are configured with three or more addresses per interface: a link-
   local address, a stable address (e.g., using 64-bit Extended Unique
   Identifiers (EUI-64) or Opaque Interface Identifiers [<a href="rfc7217.html" title='"A Method for Generating Semantically Opaque Interface Identifiers with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)"'>RFC7217</a>]), one
   or more privacy addresses [<a href="rfc4941.html" title='"Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6"'>RFC4941</a>], and possibly one or more
   temporary or non-temporary addresses obtained using the Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [<a href="rfc3315.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>].

   In most general-purpose IPv6 networks, hosts have the ability to
   configure additional IPv6 addresses from the link prefix(es) without
   explicit requests to the network.  Such networks include all 3GPP
   networks (<a href="rfc6459.html#section-5.2">[RFC6459], Section 5.2</a>), in addition to Ethernet and Wi-Fi
   networks using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [<a href="rfc4862.html" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>RFC4862</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Benefits%20of%20Providing%20Multiple%20Addresses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Benefits of Providing Multiple Addresses</span>

   Today, there are many host functions that require more than one IP
   address to be available to the host, including:

   o  Privacy addressing to prevent tracking by off-network hosts
      [<a href="rfc4941.html" title='"Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6"'>RFC4941</a>].

   o  Multiple processors inside the same device.  For example, in many
      mobile devices, both the application processor and the baseband
      processor need to communicate with the network, particularly for
      technologies like I-WLAN [<a href="#ref-TS.24327" title='"Mobility between 3GPP Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) interworking (I-WLAN) and 3GPP systems; General Packet Radio System (GPRS) and 3GPP I-WLAN aspects; Stage 3"'>TS.24327</a>] where the two processors share
      the Wi-Fi network connection.

   o  Translation-based transition technologies such as 464XLAT (a
      combination of stateful and stateless translation) [<a href="rfc6877.html" title='"464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation"'>RFC6877</a>] that
      translate between IPv4 and IPv6.  Some of these technologies
      require the availability of a dedicated IPv6 address in order to
      determine whether inbound packets are translated or native
      (<a href="rfc6877.html#section-6.3">[RFC6877], Section 6.3</a>).

   o  Identifier-locator addressing (ILA) [<a href="#ref-ILA" title='"Identifier-locator addressing for network virtualization"'>ILA</a>].

   o  Future applications (e.g., per-application IPv6 addresses [<a href="#ref-TARP" title='"Transient Addressing for Related Processes: Improved Firewalling by Using IPv6 and Multiple Addresses per Host"'>TARP</a>]).

   Two examples of how the availability of multiple addresses per host
   has already allowed substantial deployment of new applications
   without explicit requests to the network are:

   o  464XLAT. 464XLAT is usually deployed within a particular network;
      in this model, the operator can ensure that the network is
      appropriately configured to provide the customer-side translator
      (CLAT) with the additional IPv6 address it needs to implement
      464XLAT.  However, there are deployments where the provider-side
      translator (PLAT) (i.e., NAT64) is provided as a service by a
      different network, without the knowledge or cooperation of the
      residential ISP (e.g., the IPv6v4 Exchange Service [<a href="#ref-IPv6v4" title='"IPv6v4 Exchange Service"'>IPv6v4</a>]).
      This type of deployment is only possible because those residential
      ISPs provide multiple IP addresses to their users, and thus those
      users can freely obtain the extra IPv6 address required to run
      464XLAT.

   o  /64 sharing [<a href="rfc7278.html" title='"Extending an IPv6 /64 Prefix from a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Mobile Interface to a LAN Link"'>RFC7278</a>].  When the topology supports it, this is a
      way to provide IPv6 tethering without needing to wait for network
      operators to deploy DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD), which is only
      available in 3GPP release 10 or above (<a href="rfc6459.html#section-5.3">[RFC6459], Section 5.3</a>).

   Providing a restricted number of addresses per host implies that
   functions that require multiple addresses either will be unavailable
   (e.g., if the network provides only one IPv6 address per host, or if
   the host has reached the limit of the number of addresses available)
   or will only be available after an explicit request to the network is
   granted.  Requiring explicit requests to the network has the
   following drawbacks:

   o  Increased latency, because a provisioning operation, and possibly
      human intervention with an update to the Service Level Agreement
      (SLA), must complete before the functionality is available.





<span class="grey">Colitti, et al.           Best Current Practice                 [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-5" id="page-5" name="page-5"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7934.html">RFC 7934</a>        Host Address Availability Recommendations      July 2016</span>


   o  Uncertainty, because it is not known if a particular application
      function will be available until the provisioning operation
      succeeds or fails.

   o  Complexity, because implementations need to deal with failures and
      somehow present them to the user.  Failures may manifest as
      timeouts, which may be slow and frustrating to users.

   o  Increased load on the network's provisioning servers.

   Some operators may desire that their networks be configured to limit
   the number of IPv6 addresses per host.  Reasons might include
   hardware limitations (e.g., Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM)
   size or size constraints of the Neighbor Cache table), business
   models (e.g., a desire to charge the network's users on a per-device
   basis), or operational consistency with IPv4 (e.g., an IP address
   management system that only supports one address per host).  However,
   hardware limitations are expected to ease over time, and an attempt
   to generate additional revenue by charging per device may prove
   counterproductive if customers respond (as they did with IPv4) by
   using NAT, which results in no additional revenue, but leads to more
   operational problems and higher support costs.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Overcoming%20Limits%20Using%20Network%20Address%20Translation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Overcoming Limits Using Network Address Translation</span>

   When the network limits the number of addresses available to a host,
   this can mostly be overcome by end hosts by using NAT, and indeed in
   IPv4 the scarcity of addresses is often mitigated by using NAT on the
   host.  Thus, the limits could be overcome in IPv6 as well by
   implementing NAT66 on the host.

   Unfortunately, NAT has well-known drawbacks.  For example, it causes
   application complexity due to the need to implement NAT traversal.
   It hinders development of new applications.  On mobile devices, it
   reduces battery life due to the necessity of frequent keepalives,
   particularly for UDP.  Applications using UDP that need to work on
   most of the Internet are forced to send keepalives at least every 30
   seconds [<a href="#ref-KA" title='"Quick UDP Internet Connections"'>KA</a>].  For example, the QUIC protocol uses a 15-second
   keepalive [<a href="#ref-QUIC" title='"QUIC: A UDP-Based Secure and Reliable Transport for HTTP/2"'>QUIC</a>].  Other drawbacks of NAT are well-known and
   documented [<a href="rfc2993.html" title='"Architectural Implications of NAT"'>RFC2993</a>].  While IPv4 NAT is inevitable due to the
   limited amount of IPv4 space available, that argument does not apply
   to IPv6.  Guidance from the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is that
   deployment of IPv6 NAT is not desirable [<a href="rfc5902.html" title='"IAB Thoughts on IPv6 Network Address Translation"'>RFC5902</a>].

   The desire to overcome the problems listed in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> without
   disabling any features has resulted in developers implementing IPv6
   NAT.  There are fully stateful address+port NAT66 implementations in
   client operating systems today: for example, Linux has supported



<span class="grey">Colitti, et al.           Best Current Practice                 [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-6" id="page-6" name="page-6"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7934.html">RFC 7934</a>        Host Address Availability Recommendations      July 2016</span>


   NAT66 since 2012 [<a href="#ref-L66" title='"netfilter: ipv6: add IPv6 NAT support"'>L66</a>].  At least one popular software hypervisor
   also implemented NAT66 to work around these issues [<a href="#ref-V66" title="&quot;What's New in VirtualBox 4.3?&quot;">V66</a>].  Wide
   deployment of networks that provide a restricted number of addresses
   will cause proliferation of NAT66 implementations.

   This is not a desirable outcome.  It is not desirable for users
   because they may experience application brittleness.  It is likely
   not desirable for network operators either, as they may suffer higher
   support costs, and even when the decision to provide only one IPv6
   address per device is dictated by the network's business model, there
   may be little in the way of incremental revenue, because devices can
   share their IPv6 address with other devices.  Finally, it is not
   desirable for operating system manufacturers and application
   developers, who will have to build more complexity, lengthening
   development time and/or reducing the time spent on other features.

   Indeed, it could be argued that the main reason for deploying IPv6,
   instead of continuing to scale the Internet using only IPv4 and
   large-scale NAT44, is because doing so can provide all the hosts on
   the planet with end-to-end connectivity that is constrained not by
   accidental technical limitations, but only by intentional security
   policies.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Options%20for%20Providing%20More%20Than%20One%20Address"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Options for Providing More Than One Address</span>

   Multiple IPv6 addresses can be provided in the following ways:

   o  Using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [<a href="rfc4862.html" title='"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration"'>RFC4862</a>].
      SLAAC allows hosts to create global IPv6 addresses on demand by
      simply forming new addresses from the global prefix(es) assigned
      to the link.  Typically, SLAAC is used on shared links, but it is
      also possible to use SLAAC while providing a dedicated /64 prefix
      to each host.  This is the case, for example, if the host is
      connected via a point-to-point link such as in 3GPP networks, on a
      network where each host has its own dedicated VLAN, or on a
      wireless network where every Media Access Control (MAC) address is
      placed in its own broadcast domain.

   o  Using stateful DHCPv6 address assignment [<a href="rfc3315.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>].  Most DHCPv6
      clients only ask for one non-temporary address, but the protocol
      allows requesting multiple temporary and even multiple non-
      temporary addresses, and the server could choose to provide
      multiple addresses.  It is also technically possible for a client
      to request additional addresses using a different DHCP Unique
      Identifier (DUID), though the DHCPv6 specification implies that
      this is not expected behavior (<a href="rfc3315.html#section-9">[RFC3315], Section 9</a>).  The DHCPv6
      server will decide whether to grant or reject the request based on
      information about the client, including its DUID, MAC address, and



<span class="grey">Colitti, et al.           Best Current Practice                 [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-7" id="page-7" name="page-7"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7934.html">RFC 7934</a>        Host Address Availability Recommendations      July 2016</span>


      more.  The maximum number of IPv6 addresses that can be provided
      in a single DHCPv6 packet, given a typical MTU of 1500 bytes or
      smaller, is approximately 30.

   o  DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD) [<a href="rfc3633.html" title='"IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6"'>RFC3633</a>].  DHCPv6 PD allows the
      client to request and be delegated a prefix, from which it can
      autonomously form other addresses.  If the prefix is shorter than
      /64, it can be divided into multiple subnets that can be further
      delegated to downstream clients.  If the prefix is a /64, it can
      be extended via L2 bridging, Neighbor Discovery (ND) proxying
      [<a href="rfc4389.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery Proxies (ND Proxy)"'>RFC4389</a>], or /64 sharing [<a href="rfc7278.html" title='"Extending an IPv6 /64 Prefix from a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Mobile Interface to a LAN Link"'>RFC7278</a>], but it cannot be further
      subdivided, as a prefix longer than /64 is outside the current
      IPv6 specifications [<a href="rfc7421.html" title='"Analysis of the 64-bit Boundary in IPv6 Addressing"'>RFC7421</a>].  While the DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
      specification [<a href="rfc3633.html" title='"IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6"'>RFC3633</a>] assumes that the DHCPv6 client is a
      router, DHCPv6 PD itself does not require that the client forward
      IPv6 packets not addressed to itself, and thus does not require
      that the client be an IPv6 router as defined in the IPv6
      specification [<a href="rfc2460.html" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>].  Also, in many cases (such as tethering,
      or hosting virtual machines), hosts are already forwarding IPv6
      packets and thus operating as IPv6 routers as defined in the IPv6
      specification [<a href="rfc2460.html" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>].

   If we itemize the use cases from <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, we can estimate the
   number of addresses currently used in normal operations.  In typical
   implementations, privacy addresses use up to 7 addresses -- one per
   day (<a href="rfc4941.html#section-3.5">[RFC4941], Section 3.5</a>).  Current mobile devices sharing an
   uplink connection may typically support 8 downstream client devices,
   with each one requiring one or more addresses.  A client might choose
   to run several virtual machines.  Current implementations of 464XLAT
   require the use of a separate address.  Some devices require another
   address for their baseband chip.  Even a host performing just a few
   of these functions simultaneously might need on the order of 20
   addresses at the same time.  Future applications designed to use an
   address per application or even per resource will require many more.
   These will not function on networks that enforce a hard limit on the
   number of addresses provided to hosts.  Thus, in general it is not
   possible to estimate in advance how many addresses are required.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.%20%20Recommendations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" name="section-8">8</a>.  Recommendations</span>

   In order to avoid the problems described above and preserve the
   Internet's ability to support new applications that use more than one
   IPv6 address, it is RECOMMENDED that IPv6 network deployments provide
   multiple IPv6 addresses from each prefix to general-purpose hosts.
   To support future use cases, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to impose a hard
   limit on the size of the address pool assigned to a host.
   Particularly, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to limit a host to only one IPv6
   address per prefix.

   Due to the drawbacks imposed by requiring explicit requests for
   address space (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>), it is RECOMMENDED that the network
   give the host the ability to use new addresses without requiring
   explicit requests.  This can be achieved either by allowing the host
   to form new addresses autonomously (e.g., via SLAAC) or by providing
   the host with a dedicated /64 prefix.  The prefix MAY be provided
   using DHCPv6 PD, SLAAC with per-device VLANs, or any other means.

   Using stateful address assignment (DHCPv6 IA_NA or IA_TA) to provide
   multiple addresses when the host connects (e.g., the approximately 30
   addresses that can fit into a single packet) would accommodate
   current clients, but it sets a limit on the number of addresses
   available to hosts when they attach and therefore limits the
   development of future applications.

   Some network operators -- often operators of networks that provide
   services to third parties such as university campus networks -- are
   required to track which IP addresses are assigned to which hosts on
   their network.  Maintaining persistent logs that map user IP
   addresses and timestamps to hardware identifiers such as MAC
   addresses may be used to attribute liability for copyright
   infringement or other illegal activity.

   It is worth noting that this requirement can be met without using
   DHCPv6 address assignment.  For example, it is possible to maintain
   these mappings by monitoring the IPv6 neighbor table: routers
   typically allow periodic dumps of the Neighbor Cache via the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) or other means, and many can be
   configured to log every change to the Neighbor Cache.  Using SLAAC
   with a dedicated /64 prefix for each host simplifies tracking, as it
   does not require logging every address formed by the host, but only
   the prefix assigned to the host when it attaches to the network.
   Similarly, providing address space using DHCPv6 PD has the same
   tracking properties as DHCPv6 address assignment, but allows the
   network to provide unrestricted address space.

   Many large enterprise networks are fully dual stack and implement
   address monitoring without using or supporting DHCPv6.  The authors
   are directly aware of several networks that operate in this way,
   including the Universities of Loughborough, Minnesota, Reading,
   Southampton, and Wisconsin, and Imperial College London, in addition
   to the enterprise networks of the authors' employers.

   It should also be noted that using DHCPv6 address assignment does not
   ensure that the network can reliably track the IPv6 addresses used by
   hosts.  On any shared network without Layer 2 (L2) edge port
   security, hosts are able to choose their own addresses regardless of
   what address provisioning methodology the network operator believes
   is in use.  The only way to restrict the addresses used by hosts is
   to use L2 security mechanisms that enforce that particular IPv6
   addresses are used by particular link-layer addresses (for example,
   Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) [<a href="rfc7039.html" title='"Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) Framework"'>RFC7039</a>]).  If those
   mechanisms are available, it is possible to use them to provide
   tracking; this form of tracking is more secure and reliable than
   server logs because it operates independently of how addresses are
   allocated.  Finally, tracking address information via DHCPv6 server
   logs is likely to become decreasingly viable due to ongoing efforts
   to improve the privacy of DHCPv6 and MAC address randomization
   [<a href="rfc7844.html" title='"Anonymity Profiles for DHCP Clients"'>RFC7844</a>].

   In IPv4, all but the world's largest networks can be addressed using
   private space [<a href="rfc1918.html" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>], with each host receiving one IPv4 address.
   Many networks can be numbered in 192.168.0.0/16, which has roughly 65
   thousand addresses.  In IPv6, that is equivalent to a /48, with each
   host receiving a /64 prefix.  Under current Regional Internet
   Registry (RIR) policies, a /48 is easy to obtain for an enterprise
   network.  Networks that need a bigger block of private space use
   10.0.0.0/8, which has roughly 16 million addresses.  In IPv6, that is
   equivalent to a /40, with each host receiving a /64 prefix.
   Enterprises of such size can easily obtain a /40 under current RIR
   policies.

   In the above cases, aggregation and routing can be equivalent to
   IPv4: if a network aggregates per-host IPv4 addresses into prefixes
   of length /32 - n, it can aggregate per-host /64 prefixes into the
   same number of prefixes of length /64 - n.

   Currently, residential users typically receive one IPv4 address and a
   /48, /56, or /60 IPv6 prefix.  While such networks do not provide
   enough space to assign a /64 per host, such networks almost
   universally use SLAAC, and thus do not pose any particular limit to
   the number of addresses hosts can use.

   Unlike IPv4 where addresses came at a premium, in all of these
   networks there is enough IPv6 address space to supply clients with
   multiple IPv6 addresses.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.3.%20%20Addressing%20Link-Layer%20Scalability%20Issues%20via%20IP%20Routing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.3" name="section-9.3">9.3</a>.  Addressing Link-Layer Scalability Issues via IP Routing</span>

   The number of IPv6 addresses on a link has a direct impact on
   networking infrastructure nodes (routers, switches) and other nodes
   on the link.  Setting aside exhaustion attacks via L2 address
   spoofing, every (L2, IP) address pair impacts networking hardware
   requirements in terms of memory, Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)
   snooping, solicited node multicast groups, etc.  Many of these costs
   are incurred by neighboring hosts.

   Hosts on such networks that create unreasonable numbers of addresses
   risk impairing network connectivity for themselves and other hosts on
   the network, and in extreme cases (e.g., hundreds or thousands of
   addresses) may even find their network access restricted by denial-
   of-service protection mechanisms.

   We expect these scaling limitations to change over time as hardware
   and applications evolve.  However, switching to a dedicated /64
   prefix per host can resolve these scaling limitations.  If the prefix

   is provided via DHCPv6 PD, or if the prefix can be used by only one
   link-layer address (e.g., if the link layer uniquely identifies or
   authenticates hosts based on MAC addresses), then there will be only
   one routing entry and one ND cache entry per host on the network.
   Furthermore, if the host is aware that the prefix is dedicated (e.g.,
   if it was provided via DHCPv6 PD and not SLAAC), it is possible for
   the host to assign IPv6 addresses from this prefix to an internal
   virtual interface such as a loopback interface.  This obviates the
   need to perform Neighbor Discovery and Duplicate Address Detection on
   the network interface for these addresses, reducing network traffic.

   Thus, assigning a dedicated /64 prefix per host is operationally
   prudent.  Clearly, however, it requires more IPv6 address space than
   using shared links, so the benefits provided must be weighed with the
   operational overhead of address space management.

   As mentioned in <a href="#section-9.3">Section 9.3</a>, on shared networks using SLAAC, it is
   possible for hosts to attempt to exhaust network resources and
   possibly deny service to other hosts by creating unreasonable numbers
   (e.g., hundreds or thousands) of addresses.  Networks that provide
   access to untrusted hosts can mitigate this threat by providing a
   dedicated /64 prefix per host.  It is also possible to mitigate the
   threat by limiting the number of ND cache entries that can be created
   for a particular host, but care must be taken to ensure that the
   network does not prevent the legitimate use of multiple IP addresses
   by non-malicious hosts.

   Security issues related to host tracking are discussed in
