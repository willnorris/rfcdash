Abstract

   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) has been developed
   by the IETF to facilitate the establishment of Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) in a variety of data plane technologies and across several
   architectural models.  The ITU-T has specified an architecture for
   the control of Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON).

   This document provides a lexicography for the interpretation of GMPLS
   terminology within the context of the ASON architecture.

   It is important to note that GMPLS is applicable in a wider set of
   contexts than just ASON.  The definitions presented in this document
   do not provide exclusive or complete interpretations of GMPLS
   concepts.  This document simply allows the GMPLS terms to be applied
   within the ASON context.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) has been developed
   by the IETF to facilitate the establishment of Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) in a variety of data plane technologies such as Packet
   Switching Capable (PSC), Layer Two Switching Capable (L2SC), Time
   Division Multiplexing (TDM), Lambda Switching Capable (LSC), and
   Fiber Switching Capable (FSC).

   The ITU-T has specified an architecture for the control of
   Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON).  This architecture
   forms the basis of many Recommendations within the ITU-T.

   Because the GMPLS and ASON architectures were developed by different
   people in different standards bodies, and because the architectures
   have very different historic backgrounds (the Internet, and transport
   networks respectively), the terminology used is different.

   This document provides a lexicography for the interpretation of GMPLS
   terminology within the context of the ASON architecture.  This allows
   GMPLS documents to be generally understood by those familiar with
   ASON Recommendations.  The definitions presented in this document do
   not provide exclusive or complete interpretations of the GMPLS
   concepts.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   Throughout this document, angle brackets ("&lt;" and "&gt;") are used to
   indicate the context in which a term applies.  For example, "&lt;Data
   Plane&gt;" as part of a description of a term means that the term
   applies within the data plane.

   GMPLS terminology is principally defined in [<a href="rfc3945.html" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Architecture"'>RFC3945</a>].  Other
   documents provide further key definitions including [<a href="rfc4201.html" title='"Link Bundling in MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE)"'>RFC4201</a>],
   [<a href="rfc4202.html" title='"Routing Extensions in Support of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)"'>RFC4202</a>], [<a href="rfc4204.html" title='"Link Management Protocol (LMP)"'>RFC4204</a>], and [<a href="rfc4206.html" title='"Label Switched Paths (LSP) Hierarchy with Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE)"'>RFC4206</a>].

   The reader is recommended to become familiar with these other
   documents before attempting to use this document to provide a more
   general mapping between GMPLS and ASON.

   The ASON architecture is specified in ITU-T Recommendation G.8080

   Transport node &lt;Data Plane&gt; is a logical network device that is
      capable of originating and/or terminating of a data flow and/or
      switching it on the route to its destination.

   Controller &lt;Control Plane&gt; is a logical entity that models all
      control plane intelligence (routing, traffic engineering (TE), and
      signaling protocols, path computation, etc.).  A single controller
      can manage one or more transport nodes.  Separate functions (such
      as routing and signaling) may be hosted at distinct sites and
      hence could be considered as separate logical entities referred
      to, for example, as the routing controller, the signaling
      controller, etc.

   Label Switching Router (LSR) &lt;Control &amp; Data Planes&gt; is a logical
      combination of a transport node and the controller that manages
      the transport node.  Many implementations of LSRs collocate all
      control plane and data plane functions associated with a transport
      node within a single physical presence making the term LSR
      concrete rather than logical.

      In some instances, the term LSR may be applied more loosely to
      indicate just the transport node or just the controller function
      dependent on the context.

   Node &lt;Control &amp; Data Planes&gt; is a synonym for an LSR.

   Control plane network &lt;Control Plane&gt; is an IP network used for
      delivery of control plane (protocol) messages exchanged by
      controllers.

   A GMPLS transport node is an ASON network element.

   A GMPLS controller is the set of ASON functional components
   controlling a given ASON network element (or partition of a network
   element).  In ASON, this set of functional components may exist in
   one place or multiple places.

   A GMPLS node is the combination of an ASON network element (or
   partition of a network element) and its associated control
   components.

   The GMPLS control plane network is the ASON Signaling Communication
   Network (SCN).  Note that both routing and signaling exchanges are
   carried by the SCN.

   Non-packet-based resource &lt;Data Plane&gt; is a channel of a certain
      bandwidth that could be allocated in a network data plane of a
      particular technology for the purpose of user traffic delivery.
      Examples of non-packet-based resources are timeslots, lambda
      channels, etc.

   Packet-based resource &lt;Data Plane&gt; is an abstraction hiding the means
      related to the delivery of traffic with particular parameters
      (most importantly, bandwidth) with particular quality of service
      (QoS) over PSC media.  Examples of packet-based resources are
      forwarding queues, schedulers, etc.

   Layer Resource (Resource) &lt;Data Plane&gt;.  A non-packet-based data
      plane technology may yield resources in different network layers
      (see <a href="#section-3.3">section 3.3</a>).  For example, some TDM devices can operate with
      VC-12 timeslots, some with VC-4 timeslots, and some with VC4-4c
      timeslots.  There are also multiple layers of packet-based
      resources (i.e., one per label in the label stack).  Therefore, we
      define layer resource (or simply resource) irrespective of the
      underlying data plane technology as a basic data plane construct.
      It is defined by a combination of a particular data encoding type

      and a switching/terminating bandwidth granularity.  Examples of
      layer resources are: PSC1, PSC4, ATM VP, ATM VC, Ethernet, VC-12,
      VC-4, Lambda 10G, and Lambda 40G.

   These three definitions give rise to the concept of Resource Type.
   Although not a formal term, this is useful shorthand to identify how
   and where a resource can be used dependent on the switching type,
   data encoding type, and switching/terminating bandwidth granularity
   (see <a href="#section-3.8">section 3.8</a>).

   All other descriptions provided in this memo are tightly bound to the

   ASON terms for resource:

   - In the context of link discovery and resource management
     (allocation, binding into cross-connects, etc.), a GMPLS resource
     is one end of a link connection.

   - In the context of routing, path computation, and signaling, a GMPLS
     resource is a link connection or trail termination.

   Resource type is identified by a client CI (Characteristics
   Information) that could be carried by the resource.

   Layer &lt;Data Plane&gt; is a set of resources of the same type that could
      be used for establishing a connection or used for connectionless
      data delivery.

   Note.  In GMPLS, the existence of non-blocking switching function in
   a transport node in a particular layer is modeled explicitly as one
   of the functions of the link interfaces connecting the transport node
   to its data links.

   A GMPLS layer is not the same as a GMPLS region.  See <a href="#section-3.12">section 3.12</a>.

   A GMPLS unidirectional data link end is a collection of connection
   points from the same client layer that are supported by a single
   trail termination (access point).

   A GMPLS data link is an ASON link supported by a single server trail.

   Unidirectional link interface &lt;Data Plane&gt; is an abstraction that
      connects a transport node to a unidirectional data link end and
      represents (hides) the data plane intelligence like switching,
      termination, and adaptation in one direction.  In GMPLS, link
      interfaces are often referred to as "GMPLS interfaces" and it
      should be understood that these are data plane interfaces and the
      term does not refer to the ability of a control plane interface to
      handle GMPLS protocols.

      A single unidirectional data link end could be connected to a
      transport node by multiple link interfaces with one of them, for
      example, realizing switching function, while others realize the
      function of termination/adaptation.

   Bidirectional link interface &lt;Data Plane&gt; is an association of two or
      more unidirectional link interfaces that connects a transport node
      to a bidirectional data link end and represents the data plane
      intelligence like switching, termination, and adaptation in both
      directions.

   Link interface type &lt;Data Plane&gt; is identified by the function the
      interface provides.  There are three distinct functions --
      switching, termination, and adaptation; hence, there are three
      types of link interface.  Thus, when a Wavelength Division
      Multiplexing (WDM) link can do switching for some lambda channels,
      and termination and TDM OC48 adaptation for some other lambda
      channels, we say that the link is connected to the transport node
      by three interfaces each of a separate type: switching,
      termination, and adaptation.

   A GMPLS interface is the set of trail termination and adaptation
   functions between one or more server layer trails and a specific
   client layer subnetwork (which commonly is a matrix in a network
   element).

   The GMPLS interface type may be identified by the ASON adapted client
   layer, or by the terminated server layer, or a combination of the
   two, depending on the context.  In some cases, a GMPLS interface
   comprises a set of ASON trail termination/adaptation functions, for
   which some connection points are bound to trail terminations and
   others to matrices.

   In GMPLS a connection is known as a Label Switched Path (LSP).

   Unidirectional LSP (connection) &lt;Data Plane&gt; is a single resource or
      a set of cross-connected resources of a particular layer that
      could deliver traffic in that layer between a pair of transport
      nodes in one direction.

   Unidirectional LSP (connection) &lt;Control Plane&gt; is the signaling
      state necessary to maintain a unidirectional data plane LSP.

   Bidirectional LSP (connection) &lt;Data Plane&gt; is an association of two
      unidirectional LSPs (connections) that could simultaneously
      deliver traffic in a particular layer between a pair of transport
      nodes in opposite directions.

      In the context of GMPLS, both unidirectional constituents of a
      bidirectional LSP (connection) take identical paths in terms of
      data links, are provisioned concurrently, and require a single
      (shared) control state.

   Bidirectional LSP (connection) &lt;Control Plane&gt; is the signaling state
      necessary to maintain a bidirectional data plane LSP.

   LSP (connection) segment &lt;Data Plane&gt; is a single resource or a set
      of cross-connected resources that constitutes a segment of an LSP
      (connection).

   Switching capability &lt;Data Plane&gt; is a property (and defines a type)
      of a link interface that connects a particular data link to a
      transport node.  This property/type characterizes the interface's
      ability to cooperate with other link interfaces connecting data
      links within the same layer to the same transport node for the
      purpose of binding resources into cross-connects.  Switching
      capability is advertised as an attribute of the TE link local end
      associated with the link interface.

   Termination capability &lt;Data Plane&gt; is a property of a link interface
      that connects a particular data link to a transport node.  This
      property characterizes the interface's ability to terminate
      connections within the layer that the data link belongs to.

   Adaptation capability &lt;Data Plane&gt; is a property of a link interface
      that connects a particular data link to a transport node.  This
      property characterizes the interface's ability to perform a
      nesting function -- to use a locally terminated connection that
      belongs to one layer as a data link for some other layer.

   The need for advertisement of adaptation and termination capabilities
   within GMPLS has been recognized, and work is in progress to
   determine how these will be advertised.  It is likely that they will
   be advertised as a single combined attribute, or as separate
   attributes of the TE link local end associated with the link
   interface.

   TE link end &lt;Control Plane&gt; is a grouping for the purpose of
      advertising and routing of resources of a particular layer.

      Such a grouping allows for decoupling of path selection from
      resource assignment.  Specifically, a path could be selected in a
      centralized way in terms of TE link ends, while the resource
      assignment (resource reservation and label allocation) could be
      performed in a distributed way during the connection setup.  A TE
      link end may reflect zero, one or more data link ends in the data
      plane.  A TE link end is associated with exactly one layer.

   TE link &lt;Control Plane&gt; is a grouping of two TE link ends associated
      with two neighboring transport nodes in a particular layer.

      In contrast to a data link, which provides network flexibility in
      a particular layer and, therefore, is a "real" topological
      element, a TE link is a logical routing element.  For example, an
      LSP path is computed in terms of TE links (or more precisely, in
      terms of TE link ends), while the LSP is provisioned over (that
      is, resources are allocated from) data links.

   Virtual TE link is a TE link associated with zero data links.

   TE link end advertising &lt;Control Plane&gt;.  A controller managing a
      particular transport node advertises local TE link ends.  Any
      controller in the TE domain makes a TE link available for its
      local path computation if it receives consistent advertisements of
      both TE link ends.  Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as
      TE link advertising -- only TE link end advertising.  TE link end
      advertising may contain information about multiple switching
      capabilities.  This, however, should not be interpreted as
      advertising of a multi-layer TE link end, but rather as joint
      advertisement of ends of multiple parallel TE links, each
      representing resources in a separate layer.  The advertisement may
      contain attributes shared by all TE links in the group (for
      example, protection capabilities, Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs),
      etc.), separate information related to each TE link (for example,
      switching capability, data encoding, unreserved bandwidth, etc.)
      as well as information related to inter-layer relationships of the
      advertised resources (for example, termination and adaptation
      capabilities) should the control plane decide to use them as the
      termination points of higher-layer data links.  These higher-layer
      data links, however, are not real yet -- they are abstract until
      the underlying connections are established in the lower layers.

      LSPs created in lower layers for the purpose of providing data
      links (extra network flexibility) in higher layers are called
      hierarchical connections or LSPs (H-LSPs), or simply hierarchies.
      LSPs created for the purpose of providing data links in the same
      layer are called stitching segments.  H-LSPs and stitching
      segments could, but do not have to, be advertised as TE links.
      Naturally, if they are advertised as TE links (LSPs advertised as
      TE links are often referred to as TE-LSPs), they are made
      available for path computations performed on any controller within
      the TE domain into which they are advertised.  H-LSPs and
      stitching segments could be advertised either individually or in
      TE bundles.  An H-LSP or a stitching segment could be advertised
      as a TE link either into the same or a separate TE domain compared
      to the one within which it was provisioned.

      A set of H-LSPs that is created (or could be created) in a
      particular layer to provide network flexibility (data links) in
      other layers is called a Virtual Network Topology (VNT).  A single
      H-LSP could provide several (more than one) data links (each in a
      different layer).

   Forwarding Adjacency (FA) &lt;Control Plane&gt; is a TE link that does not
      require a direct routing adjacency (peering) between the
      controllers managing its ends in order to guarantee control plane
      connectivity (a control channel) between the controllers.  An
      example of an FA is an H-LSP or stitching segment advertised as a
      TE link into the same TE domain within which it was dynamically
      provisioned.  In such cases, the control plane connectivity
      between the controllers at the ends of the H-LSP/stitching segment
      is guaranteed by the concatenation of control channels
      interconnecting the ends of each of its constituents.  In
      contrast, an H-LSP or stitching segment advertised as a TE link
      into a TE domain (different than one where it was provisioned)
      generally requires a direct routing adjacency to be established
      within the TE domain where the TE link is advertised in order to
      guarantee control plane connectivity between the TE link ends.
      Therefore, is not an FA.

   The ITU term for a TE link end is Subnetwork Point (SNP) pool (SNPP).

   The ITU term for a TE link is SNPP link.

   The ITU term for an H-LSP is trail.

   TE link attribute is a parameter of the set of resources associated
      with a TE link end that is significant in the context of path
      computation.

   Full TE visibility is a situation when a controller receives all
      unmodified TE advertisements from every other controller in a
      particular set of controllers.

   Limited TE visibility is a situation when a controller receives
      summarized TE information, or does not receive TE advertisements
      from at least one of a particular set of controllers.

   TE domain is a set of controllers each of which has full TE
      visibility within the set.

   TE database (TED) is a memory structure within a controller that
      contains all TE advertisements generated by all controllers within
      a particular TE domain.

   Vertical network integration is a set of control plane mechanisms and
      coordinated data plane mechanisms that span multiple layers.  The
      control plane mechanisms exist on one or more controllers and
      operate either within a single control plane instance or between
      control plane instances.  The data plane mechanisms consist of
      collaboration and adaptation between layers within a single
      transport node.

   Horizontal network integration is a set of control plane mechanisms
      and coordinated data plane mechanisms that span multiple TE
      domains within the same layer.  The control plane mechanisms exist
      on one or more controllers and operate either within a single
      control plane instance or between control plane instances.  The
      data plane mechanisms consist of collaboration between TE domains.

   Component link end &lt;Control Plane&gt; is a grouping of resources of a
      particular layer that is not advertised as an individual TE link
      end.  A component link end could represent one or more data link
      ends or any subset of resources that belong to one or more data
      link ends.

   Component link &lt;Control Plane&gt; is a grouping of two or more component
      link ends associated with neighboring transport nodes (that is,
      directly interconnected by one or more data links) in a particular
      layer.  Component links are equivalent to TE links except that the
      component link ends are not advertised separately.

   TE bundle &lt;Control Plane&gt; is an association of several parallel (that
      is, connecting the same pair of transport nodes) component links
      whose attributes are identical or whose differences are
      sufficiently negligible that the TE domain can view the entire
      association as a single TE link.  A TE bundle is advertised in the
      same way as a TE link, that is, by representing the associated
      component link ends as a single TE link end (TE bundle end) which
      is advertised.

   TE region &lt;Control Plane&gt; is a set of one or more layers that are
      associated with the same type of data plane technology.  A TE
      region is sometimes called an LSP region or just a region.
      Examples of regions are: IP, ATM, TDM, photonic, fiber switching,
      etc.  Regions and region boundaries are significant for the
      signaling sub-system of the control plane because LSPs are
      signaled substantially differently (i.e., use different signaling
      object formats and semantics) in different regions.  Furthermore,
      advertising, routing, and path computation could be performed
      differently in different regions.  For example, computation of
      paths across photonic regions requires a wider set of constraints
      (e.g., optical impairments, wavelength continuity, etc) and needs
      to be performed in different terms (e.g., in terms of individual
      resources -- lambda channels, rather than in terms of TE links)
      compared to path computation in other regions like IP or TDM.

   As discussed in the introduction to this document, this lexicography
   is intended to bring the concepts and terms associated with GMPLS
   into the context of the ITU-T's ASON architecture.  Thus, it should
   help those familiar with ASON to see how they may use the features
   and functions of GMPLS in order to meet the requirements of an ASON.
   For example, service providers wishing to establish a protected end-
   to-end service might read [<a href="#ref-SEG-PROT" title='"GMPLS Based Segment Recovery"'>SEG-PROT</a>] and [<a href="#ref-E2E-PROT" title='"RSVP-TE Extensions in support of End-to-End Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)-based Recovery"'>E2E-PROT</a>] and wish to
   understand how the GMPLS terms used relate to the ASON architecture
   so that they can confirm that they will satisfy their requirements.

   This lexicography should not be used in order to obtain or derive
   definitive definitions of GMPLS terms.  To obtain definitions of
   GMPLS terms that are applicable across all GMPLS architectural
   models, the reader should refer to the RFCs listed in the references
   sections of this document.  [<a href="rfc3945.html" title='"Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Architecture"'>RFC3945</a>] provides an overview of the
   GMPLS architecture and should be read first.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Management%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Management Considerations</span>

   Both GMPLS and ASON networks require management.  Both GMPLS and ASON
   specifications include considerable efforts to provide operator
   control and monitoring, as well as Operations and Management (OAM)
   functionality.

   These concepts are, however, out of scope of this document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Security is also a significant requirement of both GMPLS and ASON
   architectures.

   Again, however, this informational document is intended only to
   provide a lexicography, and the security concerns are, therefore, out
   of scope.
