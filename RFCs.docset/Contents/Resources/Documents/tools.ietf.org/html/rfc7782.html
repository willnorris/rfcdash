Abstract

   TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) active-active
   service provides end stations with flow-level load balance and
   resilience against link failures at the edge of TRILL campuses, as
   described in <a href="rfc7379.html">RFC 7379</a>.

   This document specifies a method by which member RBridges (also
   referred to as Routing Bridges or TRILL switches) in an active-active
   edge RBridge group use their own nicknames as ingress RBridge
   nicknames to encapsulate frames from attached end systems.  Thus,
   remote edge RBridges (who are not in the group) will see one host
   Media Access Control (MAC) address being associated with the multiple
   RBridges in the group.  Such remote edge RBridges are required to
   maintain all those associations (i.e., MAC attachments) and to not
   flip-flop among them (as would occur prior to the implementation of
   this specification).  The design goals of this specification are
   discussed herein.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   As discussed in [<a href="rfc7379.html" title='"Problem Statement and Goals for Active-Active Connection at the Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Edge"'>RFC7379</a>], in a TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of
   Lots of Links) Active-Active Edge (AAE) topology, a Local
   Active-Active Link Protocol (LAALP) -- for example, a Multi-Chassis
   Link Aggregation (MC-LAG) bundle -- is used to connect multiple
   RBridges (Routing Bridges or TRILL switches) to multi-port Customer
   Equipment (CE), such as a switch, virtual switch (vSwitch), or
   multi-port end station.  A set of end nodes is attached in the case
   of a switch or vSwitch.  It is required that data traffic within a
   specific VLAN from this end node set (including the multi-port
   end-station case) can be ingressed and egressed by any of these
   RBridges simultaneously.  End systems in the set can spread their
   traffic among these edge RBridges at the flow level.  When a link
   fails, end systems keep using the remaining links in the LAALP
   without waiting for the convergence of TRILL, which provides
   resilience to link failures.

   Since a frame from each end node can be ingressed by any RBridge in
   the local AAE group, a remote edge RBridge may observe multiple
   attachment points (i.e., egress RBridges) for this end node.  This
   issue is known as "MAC address flip-flopping"; see [<a href="rfc7379.html" title='"Problem Statement and Goals for Active-Active Connection at the Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Edge"'>RFC7379</a>] for a
   discussion.

   Per this document, AAE member RBridges use their own nicknames to
   ingress frames into the TRILL campus.  Remote edge RBridges are
   required to keep multiple points of attachment per MAC address and
   Data Label (VLAN or Fine-Grained Label [<a href="rfc7172.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Fine-Grained Labeling"'>RFC7172</a>]) attached to the
   AAE.  This addresses the MAC flip-flopping issue.  Using this
   solution, as specified in this document, in an AAE group does not
   prohibit the use of other solutions in other AAE groups in the same
   TRILL campus.  For example, the specification in this document and
   the specification in [<a href="rfc7781.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Pseudo-Nickname for Active-Active Access"'>RFC7781</a>] could be simultaneously deployed for
   different AAE groups in the same campus.

        Figure 1: An Example Topology for TRILL Active-Active Edge

   Figure 1 shows an example network for TRILL AAE (see also Figure 1 in
   [<a href="rfc7379.html" title='"Problem Statement and Goals for Active-Active Connection at the Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Edge"'>RFC7379</a>]).  In this figure, end nodes (H1, H2, H3, and H4) are
   attached to a bridge (B) that communicates with multiple RBridges
   (RB1, RB2, and RB3) via the LAALP.  Suppose that RB4 is a "remote"
   RBridge not in the AAE group in the TRILL campus.  This connection
   model is also applicable to the virtualized environment where the
   physical bridge can be replaced with a vSwitch while those bare metal
   hosts are replaced with virtual machines (VMs).

   For a frame received from its attached end node sets, a member
   RBridge of the AAE group conforming to this document always
   encapsulates that frame using its own nickname as the ingress
   nickname, regardless of whether it is unicast or multicast.

   With the two options specified below, even though remote RBridge RB4
   will see multiple attachments for each MAC address from one of the
   end nodes, MAC address flip-flopping will not cause any problems.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Incremental%20Deployable%20Options"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Incremental Deployable Options</span>

   This section specifies two options.  Option A requires new hardware
   support.  Option B can be incrementally implemented throughout a
   TRILL campus with common existing TRILL "fast path" hardware.
   Further details on Option B are given in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>.

   Option A:
      A new capability announcement would appear in LSPs: "I can cope
      with data-plane learning of multiple attachments for an end node."
      This mode of operation is generally not supported by existing
      TRILL fast path hardware.  Only if all edge RBridges to which the
      group has data connectivity -- and that are interested in any of
      the Data Labels in which the AAE is interested -- announce this
      capability can the AAE group safely use this approach.  If all
      such RBridges do not announce this "Option A" capability, then a
      fallback would be needed, such as reverting from active-active to
      active-standby operation or isolating the RBridges that would need
      to support this capability but do not support it.  Further details
      for Option A are beyond the scope of this document, except that,
      as described in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>, a bit is reserved to indicate support
      for Option A, because a remote RBridge supporting Option A is
      compatible with an AAE group using Option B.

   Option B:
      As pointed out in <a href="rfc6325.html#section-4.2.6">Section 4.2.6 of [RFC6325]</a> and <a href="rfc7357.html#section-5.3">Section 5.3 of
      [RFC7357]</a>, one MAC address may be persistently claimed to be
      attached to multiple RBridges within the same Data Label in the
      TRILL ESADI-LSPs.  For Option B, AAE member RBridges make use of
      the TRILL ESADI protocol to distribute multiple attachments of a
      MAC address.  Remote RBridges SHOULD disable data-plane MAC
      learning for such multi-attached MAC addresses from TRILL Data
      packet decapsulation, unless they also support Option A.  The
      ability to configure an RBridge to disable data-plane learning is
      provided by the base TRILL protocol [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>].

   With Option B, the receiving edge RBridges MUST avoid flip-flop
   errors for MAC addresses learned from the TRILL Data packet
   decapsulation for the originating RBridge within these Data Labels.
   It is RECOMMENDED that the receiving edge RBridge disable data-plane
   MAC learning from TRILL Data packet decapsulation within those
   advertised Data Labels for the originating RBridge, unless the
   receiving RBridge also supports Option A.  Alternative
   implementations that produce the same expected behavior, i.e., the
   receiving edge RBridge does not flip-flop among multiple MAC
   attachments, are acceptable.  For example, the confidence-level
   mechanism as specified in [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>] can be used.  Let the receiving
   edge RBridge give a prevailing confidence value (e.g., 0x21) to the
   first MAC attachment learned from the data plane over others from the
   TRILL Data packet decapsulation.  The receiving edge RBridge will
   stick to this MAC attachment until it is overridden by one learned
   from the ESADI protocol [<a href="rfc7357.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): End Station Address Distribution Information (ESADI) Protocol"'>RFC7357</a>].  The MAC attachment learned from
   ESADI is set to have a higher confidence value (e.g., 0x80) to
   override any alternative learning from the decapsulation of received
   TRILL Data packets [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>].

   An RBridge in an AAE group MUST participate in ESADI in Data Labels
   enabled for its attached LAALPs.  This document further registers two
   data flags, which are used to advertise that the originating RBridge
   supports and participates in an AAE.  These two flags are allocated
   from the Interested VLANs Flag Bits that appear in the Interested
   VLANs and Spanning Tree Roots sub-TLV and the Interested Labels Flag
   Bits that appear in the Interested Labels and Spanning Tree Roots
   sub-TLV [<a href="rfc7176.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Use of IS-IS"'>RFC7176</a>] (see <a href="#section-8.3">Section 8.3</a>).  When these flags are set to 1,
   the originating RBridge is advertising Data Labels for LAALPs rather
   than plain LAN links.

   Remote edge RBridges need to discover RBridges in an AAE.  This is

   Whenever MAC addresses from the LAALP of this AAE are learned through
   ingress or configuration, the originating RBridge MUST advertise
   these MAC addresses using the MAC-Reachability TLV [<a href="rfc6165.html" title='"Extensions to IS-IS for Layer-2 Systems"'>RFC6165</a>] via the
   ESADI protocol [<a href="rfc7357.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): End Station Address Distribution Information (ESADI) Protocol"'>RFC7357</a>].  The MAC-Reachability TLVs are composed in
   a way that each TLV only contains MAC addresses of end nodes attached
   to a single LAALP.  Each such TLV is enclosed in a TRILL APPsub-TLV,
   defined as follows:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Type = AA-LAALP-GROUP-MAC     | (2 bytes)

   o  Type: AA LAALP Group MAC (TRILL APPsub-TLV type 253)

   o  Length: The MAC-Reachability TLV [<a href="rfc6165.html" title='"Extensions to IS-IS for Layer-2 Systems"'>RFC6165</a>] is contained in the
      value field as a sub-TLV.  The total number of bytes contained in
      the value field is given by k + 8 + 6*n.

   o  LAALP ID Size: The length, k, of the LAALP ID in bytes.

   o  LAALP ID: The ID of the LAALP, which is k bytes long.  Here, it
      also serves as the identifier of the AAE.  If the LAALP is an
      MC-LAG (or DRNI), it is the 8-byte ID, as specified in
      Clause 6.3.2 of [<a href="#ref-802.1AX" title='"IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks - Link Aggregation"'>802.1AX</a>].

   o  MAC-Reachability sub-TLV: The AA-LAALP-GROUP-MAC APPsub-TLV value
      contains the MAC-Reachability TLV as a sub-TLV (see [<a href="rfc6165.html" title='"Extensions to IS-IS for Layer-2 Systems"'>RFC6165</a>];
      n is the number of MAC addresses present).  As specified in
      <a href="rfc7356.html#section-2.2">Section 2.2 of [RFC7356]</a>, the Type and Length fields of the
      MAC-Reachability TLV are encoded as unsigned 16-bit integers.  The
      1-byte unsigned confidence value, along with these TLVs, SHOULD be
      set to prevail over those MAC addresses learned from TRILL Data
      decapsulation by remote edge RBridges.

   This AA-LAALP-GROUP-MAC APPsub-TLV MUST be included in a TRILL
   GENINFO TLV [<a href="rfc7357.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): End Station Address Distribution Information (ESADI) Protocol"'>RFC7357</a>] in the ESADI-LSP.  There may be more than one

   (the one to which the remote RBridge has the least-cost forwarding
   path) of those RBridges in the AAE identified by the LAALP ID in the
   AA-LAALP-GROUP-MAC APPsub-TLV.  If there are multiple equal
   least-cost member RBridges, the ingress RBridge is required to select
   one of them in a pseudorandom way, as specified in <a href="rfc7357.html#section-5.3">Section 5.3 of
   [RFC7357]</a>.

   When another RBridge in the same AAE group receives an ESADI-LSP with
   the AA-LAALP-GROUP-MAC APPsub-TLV, it also learns MAC addresses of
   those end nodes served by the corresponding LAALP.  These MAC
   addresses SHOULD be learned as if those end nodes are locally
   attached to this RBridge itself.

   An AAE member RBridge MUST use the AA-LAALP-GROUP-MAC APPsub-TLV to
   advertise in ESADI the MAC addresses learned from a plain local link
   (a non-LAALP link) with Data Labels that happen to be covered by the
   Data Labels of any attached LAALP.  The reason is that MAC learning
   from TRILL Data packet decapsulation within these Data Labels at the
   remote edge RBridge has normally been disabled for this RBridge.

   This APPsub-TLV changes whenever the MAC reachability situation for
   the LAALP changes.

   This section explores how this specification meets the major design
   goals of AAE.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20No%20MAC%20Address%20Flip-Flopping%20%28Normal%20Unicast%20Egress%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  No MAC Address Flip-Flopping (Normal Unicast Egress)</span>

   Since all RBridges talking with the AAE RBridges in the campus are
   able to see multiple attachments for one MAC address in ESADI
   [<a href="rfc7357.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): End Station Address Distribution Information (ESADI) Protocol"'>RFC7357</a>], a MAC address learned from one AAE member will not be
   overwritten by the same MAC address learned from another AAE member.
   Although multiple entries for this MAC address will be created, for
   return traffic the remote RBridge is required to consistently use one
   of the attachments for each MAC address rather than flip-flopping
   among them (see <a href="rfc6325.html#section-4.2.6">Section 4.2.6 of [RFC6325]</a> and <a href="rfc7357.html#section-5.3">Section 5.3 of

   LAALP guarantees that each frame will be sent to the AAE via exactly
   one uplink.  RBridges in the AAE simply follow the process per
   [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>] to ingress the frame.  For example, each RBridge uses its
   own nickname as the ingress nickname to encapsulate the frame.  In
   such a scenario, each RBridge takes for granted that it is the
   Appointed Forwarder for the VLANs enabled on the uplink of the LAALP.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.%20%20Correct%20Multicast%20Egress"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" name="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Correct Multicast Egress</span>

   A fundamental design goal of AAE is that there must be no duplication
   or forwarding loop.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.1.%20%20No%20Duplication%20%28Single%20Exit%20Point%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.1" name="section-5.3.1">5.3.1</a>.  No Duplication (Single Exit Point)</span>

   When multi-destination TRILL Data packets for a specific Data Label
   are received from the campus, it is important that exactly one
   RBridge out of the AAE group let through each multi-destination



<span class="grey">Zhang, et al.                Standards Track                   [Page 12]</span></pre>

   packet so that no duplication will happen.  The LAALP will have
   defined its selection function (using hashing or an election
   algorithm) to designate a forwarder for a multi-destination frame.
   Since AAE member RBridges support the LAALP, they are able to utilize
   that selection function to determine the single exit point.  If the
   output of the selection function points to the port attached to the
   receiving RBridge itself (i.e., the packet should be egressed out of
   this node), the receiving RBridge MUST egress this packet for that
   AAE group.  Otherwise, the packet MUST NOT be egressed for that AAE
   group.  (For ports that lead to non-AAE links, the receiving RBridge
   determines whether to egress the packet or not, according to
   [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>], which is updated by [<a href="rfc7172.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Fine-Grained Labeling"'>RFC7172</a>].)

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.2.%20%20No%20Echo%20%28Split%20Horizon%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.2" name="section-5.3.2">5.3.2</a>.  No Echo (Split Horizon)</span>

   When a multi-destination frame originated from an LAALP is ingressed
   by an RBridge of an AAE group, distributed to the TRILL network, and
   then received by another RBridge in the same AAE group, it is
   important that this receiving RBridge does not egress this frame back
   to this LAALP.  Otherwise, it will cause a forwarding loop (echo).
   The well-known "split horizon" technique (as discussed in
   <a href="rfc1058.html#section-2.2.1">Section 2.2.1 of [RFC1058]</a>) is used to eliminate the echo issue.

   RBridges in the AAE group need to perform split horizon based on the
   ingress RBridge nickname plus the VLAN of the TRILL Data packet.
   They need to set up per-port filtering lists consisting of the tuple
   of &lt;ingress nickname, VLAN&gt;.  Packets with information matching any
   entry in the filtering list MUST NOT be egressed out of that port.
   The information for such filters is obtained by listening to the
   AA-LAALP-GROUP-RBRIDGES TRILL APPsub-TLVs, as defined in
   <a href="#section-4.1.2">Section 4.1.2</a>.  Note that all enabled VLANs MUST be consistent on all
   ports connected to an LAALP.  So, the enabled VLANs need not be
   included in these TRILL APPsub-TLVs.  They can be locally obtained
   from the port attached to that LAALP.  By parsing these APPsub-TLVs,
   the receiving RBridge discovers all other RBridges connected to the
   same LAALP.  The Sender Nickname of the originating RBridge will be
   added to the filtering list of the port attached to the LAALP.  For
   example, RB3 in Figure 1 will set up a filtering list that looks like
   {&lt;RB1, VLAN 10&gt;, &lt;RB2, VLAN 10&gt;} on its port attached to LAALP1.
   According to split horizon, TRILL Data packets within VLAN 10
   ingressed by RB1 or RB2 will not be egressed out of this port.

   When there are multiple LAALPs connected to the same RBridge, these
   LAALPs may have VLANs that overlap.  Here, a VLAN overlap means that
   this VLAN ID is enabled by multiple LAALPs.  A customer may require
   that hosts within these overlapped VLANs communicate with each other.

   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> provides several scenarios to explain how hosts
   communicate within the overlapped VLANs and how split horizon
   happens.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.4.%20%20No%20Black-Hole%20or%20Triangular%20Forwarding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4" name="section-5.4">5.4</a>.  No Black-Hole or Triangular Forwarding</span>

   If a sub-link of the LAALP fails while remote RBridges continue to
   send packets towards the failed port, a black-hole happens.  If the
   AAE member RBridge with that failed port starts to redirect the
   packets to other member RBridges for delivery, triangular forwarding
   occurs.

   The member RBridge attached to the failed sub-link makes use of the
   ESADI protocol to flush those MAC addresses affected by the failure,
   as defined in <a href="rfc7357.html#section-5.2">Section 5.2 of [RFC7357]</a>.  After doing that, no packets
   will be sent towards the failed port, and hence no black-hole will
   happen.  Nor will the member RBridge need to redirect packets to
   other member RBridges; thus, triangular forwarding is avoided.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.5.%20%20Load%20Balance%20towards%20the%20AAE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.5" name="section-5.5">5.5</a>.  Load Balance towards the AAE</span>

   Since a remote RBridge can see multiple attachments of one MAC
   address in ESADI, this remote RBridge can choose to spread the
   traffic towards the AAE members on a per-flow basis.  Each of them is
   able to act as the egress point.  In doing this, the forwarding paths
   need not be limited to the least-cost path selection from the ingress
   RBridge to the AAE RBridges.  The traffic load from the remote
   RBridge towards the AAE RBridges can be balanced based on a
   pseudorandom selection method (see <a href="#section-4.1.3">Section 4.1.3</a>).

   Note that the load-balance method adopted at a remote ingress RBridge
   is not to replace the load-balance mechanism of LAALP.  These two
   load-spreading mechanisms should take effect separately.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.6.%20%20Scalability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.6" name="section-5.6">5.6</a>.  Scalability</span>

   With Option A, multiple attachments need to be recorded for a MAC
   address learned from AAE RBridges.  More entries may be consumed in
   the MAC learning table.  However, MAC addresses attached to an LAALP
   are usually only a small part of all MAC addresses in the whole TRILL
   campus.  As a result, the extra table memory space required by
   multi-attached MAC addresses can usually be accommodated in an
   RBridge's unused MAC table space.

   With Option B, remote RBridges will keep the multiple attachments of
   a MAC address in the ESADI link-state databases, which are usually
   maintained by software.  In the MAC table, which is normally
   implemented in hardware, an RBridge still establishes only one entry
   for each MAC address.

   For extensions not transported by TRILL ESADI, RBridges may be
   configured to include the IS-IS Authentication TLV (10) in the IS-IS
   PDUs to use IS-IS security [<a href="rfc5304.html" title='"IS-IS Cryptographic Authentication"'>RFC5304</a>] [<a href="rfc5310.html" title='"IS-IS Generic Cryptographic Authentication"'>RFC5310</a>].

   Since currently deployed LAALPs [<a href="rfc7379.html" title='"Problem Statement and Goals for Active-Active Connection at the Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Edge"'>RFC7379</a>] are proprietary, security
   over membership in, and internal management of, AAE groups is
   proprietary.  In environments where the above authentication is not
   adopted, a rogue RBridge that insinuates itself into an AAE group can
   disrupt end-station traffic flowing into or out of that group.  For
   example, if there are N RBridges in the group, it could typically
   control 1/Nth of the traffic flowing out of that group and a similar
   amount of unicast traffic flowing into that group.

          Figure 2: An Example Topology to Explain Split Horizon

   Suppose that RB1, RB2, and RB3 are the active-active group connecting
   LAALP1 and LAALP2.  LAALP1 and LAALP2 are connected to B1 and B2 at
   their other ends.  Suppose that all these RBridges use port L1 to
   connect LAALP1 while they use port L2 to connect LAALP2.  Assume that
   all three L1 ports enable VLANs 10-20 while all three L2 ports enable
   VLANs 15-25, so that there is an overlap of VLANs 15-20.  A customer
   may require that hosts within these overlapped VLANs communicate with
   each other.  That is, hosts attached to B1 in VLANs 15-20 need to
   communicate with hosts attached to B2 in VLANs 15-20.  Assume that
   the remote plain RBridge RB4 also has hosts attached in VLANs 15-20
   that need to communicate with those hosts in these VLANs attached to
   B1 and B2.

   There are two major requirements:

   1. Frames ingressed from RB1-L1-VLANs 15-20 MUST NOT be egressed out
      of ports RB2-L1 and RB3-L1.

   2. At the same time, frames coming from B1-VLANs 15-20 should reach
      B2-VLANs 15-20.

   RB3 stores the information for split horizon on its ports L1 and L2.

      On L1: {&lt;ingress_nickname_RB1, VLANs 10-20&gt;,
         &lt;ingress_nickname_RB2, VLANs 10-20&gt;}.

      On L2: {&lt;ingress_nickname_RB1, VLANs 15-25&gt;,
         &lt;ingress_nickname_RB2, VLANs 15-25&gt;}.











<span class="grey">Zhang, et al.                Standards Track                   [Page 20]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-21" id="page-21" name="page-21"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7782.html">RFC 7782</a>           Multi-Attach for Active-Active Edge     February 2016</span>


   Five clarification scenarios follow:

   a. Suppose that RB2 or RB3 receives a TRILL multi-destination data
      packet with VLAN 15 and ingress_nickname_RB1.  RB3 is the single
      exit point (selected according to the hashing function of LAALP)
      for this packet.  On ports L1 and L2, RB3 has covered
      &lt;ingress_nickname_RB1, VLAN 15&gt;, so that RB3 will not egress this
      packet out of either L1 or L2.  Here, "split horizon" happens.

      Beforehand, RB1 obtains a native frame on port L1 from B1 in
      VLAN 15.  RB1 determines that it should be forwarded as a
      multi-destination packet across the TRILL campus.  Also, RB1
      replicates this frame without TRILL encapsulation and sends it out
      of port L2, so that B2 will get this frame.

   b. Suppose that RB2 or RB3 receives a TRILL multi-destination data
      packet with VLAN 15 and ingress_nickname_RB4.  RB3 is the single
      exit point.  On ports L1 and L2, since RB3 has not stored any
      tuple with ingress_nickname_RB4, RB3 will decapsulate the packet
      and egress it out of both ports L1 and L2.  So, both B1 and B2
      will receive the frame.

   c. Suppose that there is a plain LAN link port L3 on RB1, RB2, and
      RB3, connecting to B10, B20, and B30, respectively.  These L3
      ports happen to be configured with VLAN 15.  On port L3, RB2 and
      RB3 store no information for split horizon for AAE (since this
      port has not been configured to be in any LAALP).  They will
      egress the packet ingressed from RB1-L1 in VLAN 15.

   d. If a packet is ingressed from RB1-L1 or RB1-L2 with VLAN 15,
      port RB1-L3 will not egress packets with ingress_nickname_RB1.
      RB1 needs to replicate this frame without encapsulation and sends
      it out of port L3.  This kind of "bounce" behavior for
      multi-destination frames is just as specified in paragraph 3 of
      <a href="rfc6325.html#section-4.6.1.2">Section 4.6.1.2 of [RFC6325]</a>.

   e. If a packet is ingressed from RB1-L3, since RB1-L1 and RB1-L2
      cannot egress packets with VLAN 15 and ingress_nickname_RB1, RB1
      needs to replicate this frame without encapsulation and sends it
      out of ports L1 and L2.  (Also see paragraph 3 of <a href="rfc6325.html#section-4.6.1.2">Section 4.6.1.2
      of [RFC6325]</a>.)
