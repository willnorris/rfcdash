                           <span class="h1">OFFICIAL PROTOCOLS</span>


This RFC identifies the documents specifying the official protocols used
in the Internet.  Annotations identify any revisions or changes planned.

To first order, the official protocols are those in the "Internet
Protocol Transition Workbook" (IPTW) dated March 1982.  There are
several protocols in use that are not in the IPTW.  A few of the
protocols in the IPTW have been revised.  Notably, the mail protocols
have been revised and issued as a volume titled "Internet Mail
Protocols" dated November 1982.  Telnet and the most useful option
protocols were issued by the NIC in a booklet entitled "Internet Telnet
Protocol and Options" (ITP), dated June 1983.  Some protocols have not
been revised for many years, these are found in the old "ARPANET
Protocol Handbook" (APH) dated January 1978.  There is also a volume of
protocol related information called the "Internet Protocol Implementers
Guide" (IPIG) dated August 1982.

This document is organized as a sketchy outline.  The entries are
protocols (e.g., Transmission Control Protocol).  In each entry there
are notes on status, specification, comments, other references,
dependencies, and contact.

   The status is one of: required, recommended, elective, or
   experimental.

   The specification identifies the protocol defining documents.

   The comments describe any differences from the specification or
   problems with the protocol.

   The other references identify documents that comment on or expand on
   the protocol.

   The dependencies indicate what other protocols are called upon by
   this protocol.

   The contact indicates a person who can answer questions about the
   protocol.

   In particular, the status may be:

      required

         - all hosts must implement the required protocol,

      recommended

         - all hosts are encouraged to implement the recommended
         protocol,

      elective

         - hosts may implement or not the elective protocol,

      experimental

         - hosts should not implement the experimental protocol unless
         they are participating in the experiment and have coordinated
         their use of this protocol with the contact person, and

      none

         - this is not a protocol.

Overview

   Catenet Model  ------------------------------------------------------

      STATUS:  None

      SPECIFICATION:  IEN 48 (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         Gives an overview of the organization and principles of the
         Internet.

         Could be revised and expanded.

Network Level

   Internet Protocol (IP)  ---------------------------------------------

      STATUS:  Required

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="rfc791.html">RFC 791</a> (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         This is the universal protocol of the Internet.  This datagram
         protocol provides the universal addressing of hosts in the
         Internet.

         A few minor problems have been noted in this document.

         The most serious is a bit of confusion in the route options.
         The route options have a pointer that indicates which octet of
         the route is the next to be used.  The confusion is between the
         phrases "the pointer is relative to this option" and "the
         smallest legal value for the pointer is 4".  If you are
         confused, forget about the relative part, the pointer begins
         at 4.

         Another important point is the alternate reassembly procedure
         suggested in <a href="rfc815.html">RFC 815</a>.

         Note that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You
         have not completed an implementation of IP if it does not
         include ICMP.

   Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)  ---------------------------

      STATUS:  Required

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="rfc792.html">RFC 792</a> (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         The control messages and error reports that go with the
         Internet Protocol.

         A few minor errors in the document have been noted.
         Suggestions have been made for additional types of redirect
         message and additional destination unreachable messages.

         Note that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You
         have not completed an implementation of IP if it does not
         include ICMP.

Host Level

   User Datagram Protocol (UDP)  ---------------------------------------

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="rfc768.html">RFC 768</a> (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         Provides a datagram service to applications.  Adds port
         addressing to the IP services.

         The only change noted for the UDP specification is a minor
         clarification that if in computing the checksum a padding octet
         is used for the computation it is not transmitted or counted in
         the length.

   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)  --------------------------------

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="rfc793.html">RFC 793</a> (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         Provides reliable end-to-end data stream service.

         Many comments and corrections have been received for the TCP
         specification document.  These are primarily document bugs
         rather than protocol bugs.

         Event Processing Section:  There are many minor corrections and
         clarifications needed in this section.

         Push:  There are still some phrases in the document that give a
         "record mark" flavor to the push.  These should be further
         clarified.  The push is not a record mark.

         Listening Servers:  Several comments have been received on
         difficulties with contacting listening servers.  There should
         be some discussion of implementation issues for servers, and
         some notes on alternative models of system and process
         organization for servers.

         Maximum Segment Size:  The maximum segment size option should
         be generalized and clarified.  It can be used to either
         increase or decrease the maximum segment size from the default.
         The default should be established more clearly.  The default is
         based on the default maximum Internet Datagram size which is
         576 octets counting the IP and TCP headers.  The option counts
         only the segment data.  For each of IP and TCP the minimum
         header is 20 octets and the maximum header is 60 octets. So the
         default maximum data segment is could be anywhere from 456 to
         536 octets.  The current proposal is to set it at 536 data
         octets.

         Idle Connections:  There have been questions about
         automatically closing idle connections.  Idle connections are
         ok, and should not be closed.  There are several cases where
         idle connections arise, for example, in Telnet when a user is
         thinking for a long time following a message from the server
         computer before his next input.  There is no TCP "probe"
         mechanism, and none is needed.

         Queued Receive Data on Closing:  There are several points where
         it is not clear from the description what to do about data


<span class="grey">Reynolds &amp; Postel                                               [Page 5]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-6" id="page-6" name="page-6"> </a>
<span class="grey">Official Protocols                                               <a href="rfc880.html">RFC 880</a></span>


         received by the TCP but not yet passed to the user,
         particularly when the connection is being closed.  In general,
         the data is to be kept to give to the user if he does a RECV
         call.

         Out of Order Segments:  The description says that segments that
         arrive out of order, that is, are not exactly the next segment
         to be processed, may be kept on hand.  It should also point out
         that there is a very large performance penalty for not doing
         so.

         User Time Out:  This is the time out started on an open or send
         call.  If this user time out occurs the user should be
         notified, but the connection should not be closed or the TCB
         deleted.  The user should explicitly ABORT the connection if he
         wants to give up.

   File Transfer Protocol (FTP)  ---------------------------------------

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  <a href="rfc765.html">RFC 765</a> (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         The protocol for moving files between Internet hosts.  Provides
         for access control and negotiation of file parameters.

         There are a number of minor corrections to be made.  A major
         change is the deletion of the mail commands, and a major
         clarification is needed in the discussion of the management of
         the data connection.  Also, a suggestion has been made to
         include some directory manipulation commands (<a href="rfc775.html">RFC 775</a>).

         Even though the MAIL features are defined in this document,
         they are not to be used.  The SMTP protocol is to be used for
         all mail service in the Internet.

         Data Connection Management:

            a.  Default Data Connection Ports:  All FTP implementations
            must support use of the default data connection ports, and
            only the User-PI may initiate the use of non-default ports.

            b.  Negotiating Non-Default Data Ports:   The User-PI may
            specify a non-default user side data port with the PORT
            command.  The User-PI may request the server side to
            identify a non-default server side data port with the PASV
            command.  Since a connection is defined by the pair of
            addresses, either of these actions is enough to get a
            different data connection, still it is permitted to do both



<span class="grey">Reynolds &amp; Postel                                              [Page 12]</span>
</pre><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-13" id="page-13" name="page-13"> </a>
<span class="grey">Official Protocols                                               <a href="rfc880.html">RFC 880</a></span>


            commands to use new ports on both ends of the data
            connection.

            c.  Reuse of the Data Connection:  When using the stream
            mode of data transfer the end of the file must be indicated
            by closing the connection.  This causes a problem if
            multiple files are to be transfered in the session, due to
            need for TCP to hold the connection record for a time out
            period to guarantee the reliable communication.  Thus the
            connection can not be reopened at once.

               There are two solutions to this problem.  The first is to
               negotiate a non-default port (as in (b) above).  The
               second is to use another transfer mode.

               A comment on transfer modes.  The stream transfer mode is
               inherently unreliable, since one can not determine if the
               connection closed prematurely or not.  The other transfer
               modes (Block, Compressed) do not close the connection to
               indicate the end of file.  They have enough FTP encoding
               that the data connection can be parsed to determine the
               end of the file.  Thus using these modes one can leave
               the data connection open for multiple file transfers.

               Why this was not a problem with the old NCP FTP:

                  The NCP was designed with only the ARPANET in mind.
                  The ARPANET provides very reliable service, and the
                  NCP counted on it.  If any packet of data from an NCP
                  connection were lost or damaged by the network the NCP
                  could not recover.  It is a tribute to the ARPANET
                  designers that the NCP FTP worked so well.

                  The TCP is designed to provide reliable connections
                  over many different types of networks and
                  interconnections of networks.  TCP must cope with a
                  set of networks that can not promise to work as well
                  as the ARPANET.  TCP must make its own provisions for
                  end-to-end recovery from lost or damaged packets.
                  This leads to the need for the connection phase-down
                  time-out.  The NCP never had to deal with
                  acknowledgements or retransmissions or many other
                  things the TCP must do to make connection reliable in
                  a more complex world.

         LIST and NLST:

            There is some confusion about the LIST an NLST commands, and
            what is appropriate to return.  Some clarification and

   Host Name Server Protocol (NAMESERVER)  -----------------------------

      STATUS:  Experimental

      SPECIFICATION:  IEN 116 (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         Provides machine oriented procedure for translating a host name
         to an Internet Address.

         This specification has significant problems:  1) The name
         syntax is out of date.  2) The protocol details are ambiguous,
         in particular, the length octet either does or doesn't include
         itself and the op code.  3) The extensions are not supported by
         any known implementation.

         Work is in progress on a significant revision.  Further
         implementations of this protocol are not advised.

         Please discuss any plans for implementation or use of this
         protocol with the contact.
