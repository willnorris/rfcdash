   The GigaBeam WiFiber(tm) product family provides a high-speed point-
   to-point radio link.  Data rates exceed 1 gigabit/second at a
   distance of about a mile.  The transmission beam width is less than
   one degree, which means that attempts to intercept the signal are
   most successful when the attacker is either between the transmitter
   and receiver or the attacker is directly behind the receiver.  Since
   interception is possible, some customers require confidentiality and
   integrity protection for the data on the radio link.  This document
   describes the security solution designed and deployed by GigaBeam to
   provide these security services.

   The GigaBeam security solution employs:

      o  AES-GCM [<a href="#ref-GCM" title='"The Galois/Counter Mode of Operation (GCM)"'>GCM</a>] with a custom security protocol specified in this
         document to provide confidentiality and integrity protection of
         subscriber traffic on the radio link;

      o  AES-CBC [<a href="#ref-CBC" title='"Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods and Techniques,"'>CBC</a>] and HMAC-SHA-1 [<a href="#ref-HMAC" title='"HMAC: Keyed- Hashing for Message Authentication"'>HMAC</a>] with IPsec ESP [<a href="#ref-ESP" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>ESP</a>] to
         provide confidentiality and integrity protection of management
         traffic between the radio control modules;

      o  AES-CBC [<a href="#ref-CBC" title='"Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods and Techniques,"'>CBC</a>] and HMAC-SHA-1 [<a href="#ref-HMAC" title='"HMAC: Keyed- Hashing for Message Authentication"'>HMAC</a>] with the IKE protocol [<a href="#ref-IKE" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>IKE</a>]
         to provide confidentiality and integrity protection of key
         management traffic between the radio control modules; and

      o  OAKLEY key agreement [<a href="#ref-OAKLEY" title='"The Oakley Key Determination Protocol"'>OAKLEY</a>] and RSA digital signatures
         [<a href="#ref-PKCS1" title='"PKCS #1: RSA Encryption Version 1.5"'>PKCS1</a>] are used with IKE to establish keying material and to
         provide authentication.

   AES-GCM is used with the custom security protocol in a manner that is
   very similar to its use in ESP [<a href="#ref-ESP-GCM" title='"The Use of Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) in IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>ESP-GCM</a>].

   The GigaBeam high-speed radio link appears to be a fiber interface
   between two network devices.  Figure 1 illustrates the connection of
   two devices that normally communicate using Gigabit Ethernet over a
   fiber optic cable.

   Gigabit Ethernet traffic is encoded in 8B/10B format.  The GigaBeam
   Radio Control Module (RCM) removes this coding to recover the 8-bit
   characters plus an indication of whether the character is a control
   code.  The radio link frame is constructed from 224 10-bit input
   words, and a 4-way interleaved (56,50,10) Reed-Solomon Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) block is employed.  Conversion of the Gigabit
   Ethernet data from 8B/10B format creates 224 bits of additional
   capacity in each frame, and another 196 bits is gained by recoding
   the 9-bit data using 64B/65B block codes.  This additional 420 bits
   of capacity is used for the framing overhead required for FEC and
   link control.

              Figure 2.  GigaBeam Radio Link Frame Structure.

   Each of the fields in the GigaBeam 2240-bit radio link frame is
   described below.

      SYNC     Synchronization field, an 11-bit Barker code.  Always set
               to '10110111000'b.

      KEYSEL   Key Selector -- select the appropriate key register for
               this frame.  Two key registers are maintained to allow
               seamless rollover between encryption keys.

      PN       Packet Number -- needed by AES-GCM; it carries the unique
               counter value for this frame.  The value is incremented
               for each frame.

      FLAGS    Control bits, one for each 64B/65B data block carried in
               the DATA field.  If the bit is set, then the
               corresponding 64B/65B block in the DATA field contains a
               control code.  This field is integrity protected by AES-
               GCM.

      DCC      Data Communications Channel -- each frame carries one
               octet of the point-to-point data communications channel
               between the two radio control modules.  See <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>
               for more information on the DCC.

      DATA     Subscriber data carried as 28 64B/65B code blocks.  This
               field is encrypted and integrity protected by AES-GCM.

               (56,50,10) algorithm.  FEC is always active, but
               correction can be selectively enabled.  For each frame,
               FEC processing also returns the number of bit errors, the
               number of symbols in error, and whether the FEC
               processing failed for the frame.  This information allows
               an estimation of the bit error rate for the link.

   The Data Communications Channel (DCC) field reserves eight bits in
   each 2240-bit radio link frame for use in constructing a dedicated
   point-to-point link between the two RCMs.  The DCC content is
   connected to a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
   controller that processes the DCC bit stream to provide an
   asynchronous serial channel that is visible to the RCM operating
   system.  The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [<a href="#ref-PPP" title='"The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)"'>PPP</a>] is used on the
   serial channel to create a simple two-node Internet Protocol (IP)
   network.  Each IP datagram is spread over a large number of radio
   link frames.  This two-node IP network carries management protocols
   between the GigaBeam RCMs.

   IKE [<a href="#ref-IKE" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>IKE</a>] runs on this two-node IP network to manage all
   cryptographic keying material.  IPsec ESP [<a href="#ref-ESP" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>ESP</a>] is used in the usual
   fashion to protect all non-IKE traffic on the data control channel.
   IPsec ESP employs AES-CBC as described in [<a href="#ref-ESP-CBC" title='"The AES-CBC Cipher Algorithm and Its Use with IPsec"'>ESP-CBC</a>] and HMAC-SHA-1 as
   described in [<a href="#ref-ESP-HMAC" title='"The Use of HMAC-SHA-1-96 within ESP and AH"'>ESP-HMAC</a>].

   The fiber interface constantly provides a stream of data encoded in
   8B/10B format.  A radio link frame is constructed from 224 10-bit
   input words.  Conversion of the data from 8B/10B format creates 224
   bits of additional capacity in each frame, and then recoding using
   64B/65B block codes creates another 196 bits of additional capacity.
   After encryption, the 64B/65B blocks are carried in the DATA field,
   and the control code indicator bits are carried in the FLAGS field.
   The additional capacity is used for the framing overhead.

   The GigaBeam RCM contains two key registers.  The single-bit KEYSEL
   field indicates which of the two registers was used for the frame.

   AES-GCM [<a href="#ref-GCM" title='"The Galois/Counter Mode of Operation (GCM)"'>GCM</a>] employs counter mode for encryption.  Therefore, a
   unique value for each frame is needed to construct the counter.  The
   counter includes a 32-bit salt value provided by IKE and a 40-bit
   packet number from the PN field in the radio link frame.  The same
   counter value must not be used for more than one frame encrypted with
   the same key.  The 128-bit counter block is constructed as shown in
   Figure 3.  The first 96 bits of the AES counter block are called the
   Nonce in the AES-GCM algorithm description.  Note that AES-GCM uses
   BLOCK values of zero and one for its own use.  The values beginning
   with two are used for encrypting the radio link frame payload.

   AES-GCM is used to protect the FLAGS and DATA fields.  The FLAGS
   field is treated as authenticated header data, and it is integrity
   protected, but it is not encrypted.  The DATA field is encrypted and
   authenticated.  The TAG field contains the authentication tag
   generated by AES-GCM, truncated to 96 bits.

   Reception processing performs decryption and integrity checking.  If
   the integrity checks fail, to maintain a continuous stream of
   traffic, the frame is replaced with K30.7 control characters.  These

   control characters are normally used to mark errors in the data
   stream.  Without encryption and integrity checking, these control
   characters usually indicate 8B/10B running disparity or code errors.

   The 224 10-bit data symbols that make up each radio link frame are
   grouped into 4 subframes each consisting of 56 symbols.  The
   subframes are formed by symbol interleaving.  A Reed-Solomon Code,
   RS(56,50), designed for 10-bit symbols is applied to each subframe.

   This Reed Solomon Code detects 6 errors and corrects 3 errors within
   each subframe.  The FEC function is always active; however, it is
   possible to disable correction of the received data to support
   debugging.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20Scrambler"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Scrambler</span>

   The scrambler ensures that long series of one bits and long series of
   zero bits do not occur.  When encryption is enabled, long series of
   common bit values is very unlikely; however, during the initial IKE
   exchange, the radio link frame payload is all zero bits.

   The scrambling polynomial is (1 + x^14 + x^15).  All words of a frame
   except the SYNC pattern are scrambled prior to transmission using
   this linear feedback shift register (LFSR).  The LFSR is initialized
   to all ones at the start of each frame, prior to the first processed
   bit.  Each processed input bit is added modulo 2 (i.e., an XOR) to
   the output of the x15 tap to form the output bit.

   On reception, an identical process is performed after frame
   synchronization and prior to subsequent processing to recover the
   original bit pattern.

   The data stream is differentially encoded to avoid symbol ambiguity
   at the receiver.  Since the demodulator could produce true or
   inverted data depending on the details of the radio frequency (RF)
   and intermediate frequency (IF) processing chains, differential
   encoding is used to ensure proper reception of the intended bit
   value.  A zero bit is encoded as no change from the previous output
   bit, and a one bit is encoded as a change from the previous output
   bit.  Thus, an output bit is the result of XORing the unencoded bit
   with the previously transmitted encoded bit.

   On reception, a complementary operation will be performed to produce
   the decoded datastream.  The bitstream is formed by XORing the
   received encoded bit and the previously received encoded bit.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Key%20Management"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Key Management</span>

   The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is used for key management [<a href="#ref-IKE" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>IKE</a>].
   IKE has two phases.  In Phase 1, two Internet Security Association
   and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) peers establish a secure,
   authenticated channel with which to communicate.  This is called the
   ISAKMP Security Association (SA).  In the GigaBeam environment, the
   Phase 1 exchange is IKE Aggressive Mode with signatures and
   certificates.  The RSA signature algorithm is used.

   Phase 2 negotiates the Security Associations for the GigaBeam custom
   security protocol that protects subscriber traffic and IPsec ESP that
   protects management traffic between the GigaBeam RCMs.  In the
   GigaBeam environment, the Phase 2 exchange is IKE Quick Mode, without
   perfect forward secrecy (PFS).  The information exchanged along with
   Quick Mode is protected by the ISAKMP SA.  That is, all payloads
   except the ISAKMP header are encrypted.  A detailed description of
   Quick Mode can be found in Section 5.5 of [<a href="#ref-IKE" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>IKE</a>].

   When the Security Association is no longer needed, the ISAKMP Delete
   Payload is used to tell the peer GigaBeam device that it is being
   discarded.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Certificates"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Certificates</span>

   Each GigaBeam device generates its own public/private key pair.  This
   generation is performed at the factory, and the public key is
   certified by a Certification Authority (CA) in the factory.  The
   certificate includes a name of the following format:

   C=US O=GigaBeam Corporation OU=GigaBeam WiFiber(tm)
   SerialNumber=&lt;device-model-identifier&gt;/&lt;device-serial-number&gt;

   The ISAKMP Certificate Payload is used to transport certificates, and
   in the GigaBeam environment, the "X.509 Certificate - Signature"
   certificate encoding type (indicated by a value of 4) is always used.

   GigaBeam devices are always installed in pairs.  At installation
   time, each one is configured with the device model identifier and
   device serial number of its peer.  The device model identifier and
   device serial number of a backup device can also be provided.  An
   access control check is performed when certificates are exchanged.
   The certificate subject name must match one of these configured

   With IKE, several possible Diffie-Hellman groups are supported.
   These groups originated with the Oakley protocol and are therefore
   called "Oakley Groups".

   The ISAKMP proposal syntax was specifically designed to allow for the

   suites.  The identifiers for the IPsec Domain of Interpretation (DOI)
   are given in [<a href="#ref-IPDOI" title='"The Internet IP Security Domain of Interpretation for ISAKMP"'>IPDOI</a>].

   The GigaBeam custom security protocol has been assigned the
   PROTO_GIGABEAM_RADIO protocol identifier, with a value of 5.

   The PROTO_GIGABEAM_RADIO specifies the use of the GigaBeam radio link
   frame structure, which uses a single algorithm for both
   confidentiality and authentication.  The following table indicates
   the algorithm values that are currently defined.

   GIGABEAM_AES128_GCM requires 20 octets of keying material (called
   KEYMAT in [<a href="#ref-IKE" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>IKE</a>]).  The first 16 octets are the 128-bit AES key, and
   the remaining four octets are used as the salt value in the AES
   counter block.

   Presently, AES with a 128-bit key is the only encryption algorithm
   that is supported.  Other encryption algorithms could be registered
   in the future.

   The least significant bit of the Security Parameter Index (SPI) is
   used in the GigaBeam custom security protocol.  When two GigaBeam
   custom security protocol security associations are active at the same
   time for communications in the same direction, the least significant

   associations can be distinguished by the single bit in the GigaBeam
   custom security protocol.

   The IKE exchange over the DCC must complete before subscriber data
   can be exchanged in the GigaBeam radio link frame payload.  Since
   each radio link frame carries a small portion of an IP datagram, many
   radio link frames carrying all zero bits must be sent and received to
   complete the IKE exchange.

   Once the initial keying material is in place, the IKE exchanges to
   establish subsequent keying material can be performed concurrent with
   the transfer of subscriber data in the radio link frame payload.  The
   KEYSEL field in the radio link frame is used to indicate which keying
   material is being used.

   The PN field in radio link frame provides a continuous indication of
   the number of frames that have been encrypted with a particular key.
   Once a threshold is exceeded, the IKE exchanges begin to establish
   the replacement keying material.  Currently, the exchanges begin when
   half of the packet numbers have been used, but any threshold can be
   employed, as long as the replacement keying material is available
   before the packet counters are exhausted.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security considerations in [<a href="#ref-IKE" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>IKE</a>], [<a href="#ref-OAKLEY" title='"The Oakley Key Determination Protocol"'>OAKLEY</a>], [<a href="#ref-PKCS1" title='"PKCS #1: RSA Encryption Version 1.5"'>PKCS1</a>], and [<a href="#ref-ESP" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>ESP</a>]
   apply to the security system defined in this document.

   Confidentiality and integrity are provided by the use of negotiated
   algorithms.  AES-GCM [<a href="#ref-GCM" title='"The Galois/Counter Mode of Operation (GCM)"'>GCM</a>] is used with the GigaBeam custom security
   protocol to provide confidentiality and integrity protection of
   subscriber traffic on the radio link.  AES-CBC [<a href="#ref-CBC" title='"Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods and Techniques,"'>CBC</a>] and HMAC-SHA-1
   [<a href="#ref-HMAC" title='"HMAC: Keyed- Hashing for Message Authentication"'>HMAC</a>] are used with IPsec ESP [<a href="#ref-ESP" title='"IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>ESP</a>] to provide confidentiality and
   integrity protection of management traffic between the radio control
   modules.

   AES-GCM makes use of AES Counter mode to provide confidentiality.
   Unfortunately, it is very easy to misuse counter mode.  If counter
   block values are ever used for more than one frame with the same key,
   then the same key stream will be used to encrypt both frames, and the
   confidentiality guarantees are voided.  Using AES Counter mode with
   the same counter values to encrypt two plaintexts under the same key
   leaks the plaintext.  The automated key management described here is
   intended to prevent this from ever happening.

   Since AES has a 128-bit block size, regardless of the mode employed,
   the ciphertext generated by AES encryption becomes distinguishable
   from random values after 2^64 blocks are encrypted with a single key.
   Since the GigaBeam radio link frame allows for up to 2^40 fixed-
   length frames in a single security association, there is no
   possibility for more than 2^64 blocks to be encrypted with one key.

   The lifetime of a particular AES key can be shorter than 2^40 frames.
   A smaller threshold can be used as a trigger to transition to the
   next key.  This capability allows straightforward implementation of
   policies that require the key to be changed after a particular volume
   of traffic or a particular amount of time.

   There are fairly generic precomputation attacks against all block
   cipher modes that allow a meet-in-the-middle attack against the key.
   These attacks require the creation and searching of huge tables of
   ciphertext associated with known plaintext and known keys.  Assuming
   that the memory and processor resources are available for a

   precomputation attack, then the theoretical strength of AES Counter
   mode (and any other block cipher mode) is limited to 2^(n/2) bits,
   where n is the number of bits in the key.  The use of long keys is
   the best countermeasure to precomputation attacks.  The unpredictable
   nonce value in the counter block significantly increases the size of
   the table that the attacker must compute to mount a successful
   precomputation attack.

   Rekeying with Quick Mode results in new keys to protect GigaBeam
   radio link frames; however, these keys are generated from the same
   Diffie-Hellman shared secret.  In order to limit the amount of data
   that would be exposed by the disclosure of this Diffie-Hellman shared
   secret or the associated Diffie-Hellman private key, implementations
   should periodically rekey using a new Phase 1 exchange.

   Diffie-Hellman exponents used in IKE Phase 1 should be erased from
   memory immediately after use.  Likewise, AES and HMAC-SHA-1 keying
   material should be erased from memory when it is no longer needed.

   This security solution makes use of IKEv1 [<a href="#ref-IKE" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>IKE</a>].  IKEv1 was selected
   over IKEv2 [<a href="#ref-IKEv2" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) Protocol"'>IKEv2</a>] primarily due to the availability of an
   implementation for the processing environment.  The use of IKEv2
   would provide some useful capabilities, such as Diffie-Hellman group
   negotiation.  These additional capabilities would not significantly
   improve the security of the overall key management solution that runs
   on the two-node IP network.
