Abstract

   This document describes a protocol intended to provide lossless
   compression for Internet Protocol datagrams in an Internet
   environment.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   IP payload compression is a protocol to reduce the size of IP
   datagrams.  This protocol will increase the overall communication
   performance between a pair of communicating hosts/gateways ("nodes")
   by compressing the datagrams, provided the nodes have sufficient
   computation power, through either CPU capacity or a compression
   coprocessor, and the communication is over slow or congested links.

   IP payload compression is especially useful when encryption is
   applied to IP datagrams.  Encrypting the IP datagram causes the data
   to be random in nature, rendering compression at lower protocol
   layers (e.g., PPP Compression Control Protocol [<a href="rfc1962.html" title='"The PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP)"'>RFC1962</a>])
   ineffective.  If both compression and encryption are required,
   compression must be applied before encryption.

   This document defines the IP payload compression protocol (IPComp),
   the IPComp packet structure, the IPComp Association (IPCA), and
   several methods to negotiate the IPCA.

   Other documents shall specify how a specific compression algorithm
   can be used with the IP payload compression protocol.  Such
   algorithms are beyond the scope of this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Compression%20Process"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Compression Process</span>

   The compression processing of IP datagrams has two phases:
   compressing of outbound IP datagrams ("compression") and
   decompressing of inbound datagrams ("decompression").  The
   compression processing MUST be lossless, ensuring that the IP
   datagram, after being compressed and decompressed, is identical to
   the original IP datagram.

   Each IP datagram is compressed and decompressed by itself without any
   relation to other datagrams ("stateless compression"), as IP
   datagrams may arrive out of order or not arrive at all.  Each
   compressed IP datagram encapsulates a single IP payload.

   Processing of inbound IP datagrams MUST support both compressed and
   non-compressed IP datagrams, in order to meet the non-expansion
   policy requirements, as defined in <a href="#section-2.2">section 2.2</a>.

   The compression of outbound IP datagrams MUST be done before any IP
   security processing, such as encryption and authentication, and
   before any fragmentation of the IP datagram.  In addition, in IP
   version 6 [<a href="rfc2460.html" title='"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification"'>RFC2460</a>], the compression of outbound IP datagrams MUST be
   done before the addition of either a Hop-by-Hop Options header or a
   Routing Header, since both carry information that must be examined
   and processed by possibly every node along a packet's delivery path,
   and therefore MUST be sent in the original form.

   Similarly, the decompression of inbound IP datagrams MUST be done
   after the reassembly of the IP datagrams, and after the completion of
   all IP security processing, such as authentication and decryption.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3173.html">RFC 3173</a>            IP Payload Compression Protocol       September 2001</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20Compressed%20Payload"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>. Compressed Payload</span>

   The compression is applied to a single array of octets, which are
   contiguous in the IP datagram.  This array of octets always ends at
   the last octet of the IP packet payload.  Note: A contiguous array of
   octets in the IP datagram may be not contiguous in physical memory.

   In IP version 4 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0791" title='"Internet Protocol"'>RFC0791</a>], the compression is applied to the payload
   of the IP datagram, starting at the first octet following the IP
   header, and continuing through the last octet of the datagram.  No
   portion of the IP header or the IP header options is compressed.
   Note: In the case of an encapsulated IP header (e.g., tunnel mode
   encapsulation in IPsec), the datagram payload is defined to start
   immediately after the outer IP header; accordingly, the inner IP
   header is considered part of the payload and is compressed.

   In the IPv6 context, IPComp is viewed as an end-to-end payload, and
   MUST NOT apply to hop-by-hop, routing, and fragmentation extension
   headers.  The compression is applied starting at the first IP Header
   Option field that does not carry information that must be examined
   and processed by nodes along a packet's delivery path, if such an IP
   Header Option field exists, and continues to the ULP payload of the
   IP datagram.

   The size of a compressed payload, generated by the compression
   algorithm, MUST be in whole octet units.

   As defined in <a href="#section-3">section 3</a>, an IPComp header is inserted immediately
   preceding the compressed payload.  The original IP header is modified
   to indicate the usage of the IPComp protocol and the reduced size of
   the IP datagram.  The original content of the Next Header (IPv6) or
   protocol (IPv4) field is stored in the IPComp header.

   The decompression is applied to a single contiguous array of octets
   in the IP datagram.  The start of the array of octets immediately
   follows the IPComp header and ends at the last octet of the IP
   payload.  If the decompression process is successfully completed, the
   IP header is modified to indicate the size of the decompressed IP
   datagram, and the original next header as stored in the IPComp
   header.  The IPComp header is removed from the IP datagram and the
   decompressed payload immediately follows the IP header.

   If the total size of a compressed payload and the IPComp header, as
   defined in <a href="#section-3">section 3</a>, is not smaller than the size of the original
   payload, the IP datagram MUST be sent in the original non-compressed
   form.  To clarify: If an IP datagram is sent non-compressed, no

   IPComp header is added to the datagram.  This policy ensures saving
   the decompression processing cycles and avoiding incurring IP
   datagram fragmentation when the expanded datagram is larger than the
   MTU.

   Small IP datagrams are likely to expand as a result of compression.
   Therefore, a numeric threshold should be applied before compression,
   where IP datagrams of size smaller than the threshold are sent in the
   original form without attempting compression.  The numeric threshold
   is implementation dependent.

   An IP datagram with payload that has been previously compressed tends
   not to compress any further.  The previously compressed payload may
   be the result of external processes, such as compression applied by
   an upper layer in the communication stack, or by an off-line
   compression utility.  An adaptive algorithm should be implemented to
   avoid the performance hit.  For example, if the compression of i
   consecutive IP datagrams of an IPCA fails, the next several IP
   datagrams, say k, are sent without attempting compression.  If then
   the next j datagrams also fail to compress, a larger number of
   datagrams, say k+n, are sent without attempting compression.  Once a
   datagram is compressed successfully, the normal process of IPComp
   restarts.  Such an adaptive algorithm, including all the related
   thresholds, is implementation dependent.

   During the processing of the payload, the compression algorithm MAY
   periodically apply a test to determine the compressibility of the
   processed data, similar to the requirements of [<a href="#ref-V42BIS" title='"Data Compression Procedures for Data Circuit Terminating Equipment (DCE) Using Error Correction Procedures"'>V42BIS</a>].  The nature
   of the test is algorithm dependent.  Once the compression algorithm
   detects that the data is non-compressible, the algorithm SHOULD stop

   A compressed IP datagram is encapsulated by modifying the IP header
   and inserting an IPComp header immediately preceding the compressed
   payload.  This section defines the IP header modifications both in
   IPv4 and IPv6, and the structure of the IPComp header.

   The following IPv4 header fields are set before transmitting the
   compressed IP datagram:

   The IPComp header is placed in an IPv6 packet using the same rules as
   the IPv6 Fragment Header.  However if an IPv6 packet contains both an
   IPv6 Fragment Header and an IPComp header, the IPv6 Fragment Header
   MUST precede the IPComp header in the packet.  Note: Other IPv6
   headers may be present between the IPv6 Fragment Header and the
   IPComp header.

   Compression Parameter Index (CPI)

      16-bit index.  The CPI is stored in network order.  The values

      themselves are identical to IPCOMP Transform identifiers as
      defined in [<a href="#ref-SECDOI" title='"The Internet IP Security Domain of Interpretation for ISAKMP"'>SECDOI</a>].  Consult [<a href="#ref-SECDOI" title='"The Internet IP Security Domain of Interpretation for ISAKMP"'>SECDOI</a>] for an initial set of
      defined values and for instructions on how to assign new values.
      The values 64-255 are reserved for future use.  The values
      256-61439 are negotiated between the two nodes in definition of an
      IPComp Association, as defined in <a href="#section-4">section 4</a>.  Note: When
      negotiating one of the well-known algorithms, the nodes MAY select
      a CPI in the pre-defined range 0-63.  The values 61440-65535 are
      for private use among mutually consenting parties.  Both nodes
      participating can select a CPI value independently of each other
      and there is no relationship between the two separately chosen
      CPIs.  The outbound IPComp header MUST use the CPI value chosen by
      the decompressing node.  The CPI in combination with the
      destination IP address uniquely identifies the compression
      algorithm characteristics for the datagram.

   To utilize the IPComp protocol, two nodes MUST first establish an
   IPComp Association (IPCA) between them.  The IPCA includes all
   required information for the operation of IPComp, including the
   Compression Parameter Index (CPI), the mode of operation, the
   compression algorithm to be used, and any required parameter for the
   selected compression algorithm.

   The policy for establishing IPComp may be either a node-to-node
   policy where IPComp is applied to every IP packet between the nodes,
   or a session-based policy where only selected sessions between the
   nodes employ IPComp.

   Two nodes may choose to negotiate IPComp in either or both
   directions, and they may choose to employ a different compression
   algorithm in each direction.  The nodes MUST, however, negotiate a
   compression algorithm in each direction for which they establish an
   IPCA: there is no default compression algorithm.

   No compression algorithm is mandatory for an IPComp implementation.

   The IPCA is established by dynamic negotiations or by manual
   configuration.  The dynamic negotiations SHOULD use the Internet Key
   Exchange protocol [<a href="#ref-IKE" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>IKE</a>], where IPsec is present.  The dynamic
   negotiations MAY be implemented through a different protocol.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20Use%20of%20IKE"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>. Use of IKE</span>

   For IPComp in the context of IP Security, IKE provides the necessary
   mechanisms and guidelines for establishing IPCA.  Using IKE, IPComp
   can be negotiated as stand-alone or in conjunction with other IPsec
   protocols.

   An IPComp Association is negotiated by the initiator using a Proposal
   Payload, which includes one or more Transform Payloads.  The Proposal
   Payload specifies the IP Payload Compression Protocol in the protocol
   ID field and each Transform Payload contains the specific compression
   algorithm(s) being offered to the responder.

   The CPI is sent in the SPI field of the proposal, with the SPI size
   field set to match.  The CPI SHOULD be sent as a 16-bit number, with
   the SPI size field set to 2.  Alternatively, the CPI MAY be sent as a
   32-bit value, with the SPI size field set to 4.  In this case, the
   16-bit CPI number MUST be placed in the two least significant octets
   of the SPI field, while the two most significant octets MUST be set
   to zero, and MUST be ignored by the receiving node.  The receiving
   node MUST be able to process both forms of the CPI proposal.

   In the Internet IP Security Domain of Interpretation (DOI), IPComp is
   negotiated as the Protocol ID PROTO_IPCOMP.  The compression
   algorithm is negotiated as one of the defined IPCOMP Transform
   Identifiers.

   The following attributes are applicable to IPComp proposals:

      Encapsulation Mode

         To propose a non-default Encapsulation Mode (such as Tunnel
         Mode), an IPComp proposal MUST include an Encapsulation Mode
         attribute.  If the Encapsulation Mode is unspecified, the
         default value of Transport Mode is assumed.

      Lifetime

         An IPComp proposal uses the Life Duration and Life Type
         attributes to suggest life duration to the IPCA.

   When IPComp is negotiated as part of a Protection Suite, all the
   logically related offers must be consistent.  However, an IPComp
   proposal SHOULD NOT include attributes that are not applicable to
   IPComp.  An IPComp proposal MUST NOT be rejected because it does not
   include attributes of other protocols in the Protection Suite that
   are not relevant to IPComp.  When an IPComp proposal includes such
   attributes, those attributes MUST be ignored when setting the IPCA,
   and therefore ignored in the operation of IPComp.

   Implementation note:

      A node can avoid the computation necessary for determining the
      compression algorithm from the CPI if it is using one of the
      well-known algorithms; this can save time in the decompression
      process.  A node can do this by negotiating a CPI equal in value
      to the pre-defined Transform identifier of that compression
      algorithm.  Specifically: A node MAY offer a CPI in the pre-
      defined range by sending a Proposal Payload that MUST contain a
      single Transform Payload, which is identical to the CPI.  When
      proposing two or more Transform Payloads, a node MAY offer CPIs in
      the pre-defined range by using multiple IPComp proposals -- each
      MUST include a single Transform Payload.  To clarify: If a
      Proposal Payload contains two or more Transform Payloads, the CPI
      MUST be in the negotiated range.  A receiving node MUST be able to
      process each of these proposal forms.

   Implementation note:

      IPCAs become non-unique when two or more IPComp sessions are
      established between two nodes, and the same well-known CPI is used
      in at least two of the sessions.  Non-unique IPCAs pose problems
      in maintaining attributes specific to each IPCA, either negotiated
      (e.g., lifetime) or internal (e.g., the counters of the adaptive
      algorithm for handling previously compressed payload).  To ensure
      the uniqueness of IPCAs between two nodes, when two or more of the
      IPCAs use the same compression algorithm, the CPIs SHOULD be in
      the negotiated range.  However, when the IPCAs are not required to
      be unique, for example when no attribute is being utilized for
      these IPCAs, a well-known CPI MAY be used.  To clarify: When only
      a single session using a particular well-known CPI is established
      between two nodes, this IPCA is unique.

   The dynamic negotiations MAY be implemented through a protocol other
   than IKE.  Such a protocol is beyond the scope of this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20Manual%20Configuration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>. Manual Configuration</span>

   Nodes may establish IPComp Associations using manual configuration.
   For this method, a limited number of Compression Parameters Indexes
   (CPIs) is designated to represent a list of specific compression
   methods.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   When IPComp is used in the context of IPsec, it is believed not to
   have an effect on the underlying security functionality provided by
   the IPsec protocol; i.e., the use of compression is not known to
   degrade or alter the nature of the underlying security architecture
   or the encryption technologies used to implement it.

   When IPComp is used without IPsec, IP payload compression potentially
   reduces the security of the Internet, similar to the effects of IP
   encapsulation [<a href="rfc2003.html" title='"IP Encapsulation within IP"'>RFC2003</a>].  For example, IPComp may make it difficult
   for border routers to filter datagrams based on header fields.  In
   particular, the original value of the Protocol field in the IP header
   is not located in its normal positions within the datagram, and any
   transport layer header fields within the datagram, such as port
   numbers, are neither located in their normal positions within the
   datagram nor presented in their original values after compression.  A
   filtering border router can filter the datagram only if it shares the
   IPComp Association used for the compression.  To allow this sort of
   compression in environments in which all packets need to be filtered

   (or at least accounted for), a mechanism must be in place for the
   receiving node to securely communicate the IPComp Association to the
   border router.  This might, more rarely, also apply to the IPComp
   Association used for outgoing datagrams.

   This section summarizes the changes in this document from <a href="rfc2393.html">RFC 2393</a> of
   which an implementer of <a href="rfc2393.html">RFC 2393</a> should be aware.  All the changes
   are meant to clarify the negotiation of an IPComp Association (IPCA)
   using IKE [<a href="#ref-IKE" title='"The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)"'>IKE</a>] in the context of IPsec.

   1) Added a clarification that IPComp can be negotiated stand-alone or
      bundled with other protocols in a Protection Suite.

   2) Defined the CPI in the SPI field of an IKE proposal: two-octet
      field is a SHOULD, four-octet a MAY.  Defined the placement of the
      16-bit CPI in a four-octet field.  Specified that a receiver MUST
      process both field sizes.

   3) Added wording to define the default Encapsulation Mode to be
      Transport Mode.  Required that an IPComp proposal MUST include an
      Encapsulation Mode attribute when it suggests a non-default
      encapsulation, such as Tunnel Mode.

   4) Added the Lifetime attribute to the list of supported attributes
      (along with Transport Mode).

   5) Specified the handling of attributes of transforms in a Protection
      Suite that are not applicable to IPComp: These attributes SHOULD
      NOT be included in an IPComp proposal and MUST be ignored when
      setting IPCA and in the operation of IPComp.  IPComp
      implementations MUST never reject an IPCOMP proposal that does not
      include attributes of other transforms.

   6) Added implementation notes on the negotiation and usage of CPIs in
      the predefined (well-known) range.
