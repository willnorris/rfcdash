   The management of producing a printed document, in any computer
   environment, is a complex subject. Basically, the task can be divided
   into two overlapping pieces, the management of printing and the
   management of the printer. Printing encompasses the entire process of
   producing a printed document from generation of the file to be
   printed, selection of a printer, choosing printing properties,
   routing, queuing, resource management, scheduling, and final printing
   including notifying the user.  Most of the printing process is outside
   the scope of the model presented here; only the management of the
   printer is covered.

   A printer is the physical device that takes media from an input
   source, produces marks on that media according to some page
   description or page control language and puts the result in some
   output destination, possibly with finishing applied. Printers are
   complex devices that consume supplies, produce waste and have
   mechanical problems. In the management of the physical printing
   device the description, status and alert information concerning the
   printer and its various subparts has to be made available to the

   management application so that it can be reported to the end user,
   key operators for the replenishment of supplies or the repair or
   maintenance of the device. The information needed in the management
   of the physical printer and the management of a printing job overlap
   highly and many of the tasks in each management area require the same
   or similar information.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.%20%20Categories%20of%20Printer%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Categories of Printer Information</span>

   Information about printers is classified into three basic categories,
   descriptions, status and alerts.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.1.%20%20Descriptions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3.1" name="section-1.3.1">1.3.1</a>.  Descriptions</span>

   Descriptions convey information about the configuration and
   capabilities of the printer and its various sub-units. This
   information is largely static information and does not generally
   change during the operation of the system but may change as the
   printer is repaired, reconfigured or upgraded. The descriptions are
   one part of the visible state of the printer where state means the
   condition of being of the printer at any point in time.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.2.%20%20Status"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3.2" name="section-1.3.2">1.3.2</a>.  Status</span>

   Status is the information regarding the current operating state of
   the printer and its various sub-units. Status is the rest of the
   visible state of the printer. As an example of the use of status, a
   management application must be able to determine if the various sub-
   units are ready to print or are in some state that prevents printing
   or may prevent printing in the future.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.3.%20%20Alerts"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3.3" name="section-1.3.3">1.3.3</a>.  Alerts</span>

   An Alert is the representation of a reportable event in the printer.
   An event is a change in the state of the printer. Some of those state
   changes are of interest to a management application and are therefore
   reportable. Typically, these are the events that affect the printer's
   ability to print. Alerts usually occur asynchronously to the
   operation of the computer system(s) to which the printer is attached.
   For convenience below, "alert" will be used for both the event caused
   by a change in the printer's state and for the representation of that
   event.

   Alerts can be classified into two basic categories, critical and
   non-critical.  A critical alert is one that is triggered by entry
   into a state in which the printer is stopped and printing can not
   continue until the condition that caused critical alert is
   eliminated. "Out of paper", "toner empty" and "output bin full" are

   examples of critical alerts. Non-critical alerts are triggered by
   those events that enter a state in which printing is not stopped.
   Such a non-critical state may, at some future time, lead to a state
   in which printing may be stopped.  Examples of this kind of non-
   critical alerts are "input media low", "toner low" and "output bin
   nearly full". Or, a non-critical alert may simply provide
   information, such as signaling a configuration changed in the
   printer.

   Description, status and alert information about printer can be
   thought of as a data base describing the printer. The management
   application for a printer will want to view the printer data base
   differently depending on how and for what purposes the information in
   the data base is needed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Printer%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Printer Model</span>

   In order to accomplish the management of the printer, an abstract
   model of the printer is needed to represent the sub-units from which
   the printer is composed. A printer can be described as consisting of
   13 types of sub-units. It is important to note that the sub-units of
   a printer do not necessarily relate directly to any physically
   identifiable mechanism. Sub-units can also be a set of definable
   logical processes, such as interpreters for page description
   languages or command processors that set various operating modes of
   the printer.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Overview%20of%20the%20Printer%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Overview of the Printer Model</span>

   The model has three basic parts: (1) the flow of a print file into an
   interpreter and onto the marker, (2) the flow of media through the
   marker and (3) the auxiliary sub-units that control and facilitate
   the two prior flows.  The flow of the print data comes through a
   physical connection on which some form of transport protocol stack is
   running.  The data provided by the transport protocol (interface)
   appears on a channel which is the input to an interpreter. The
   interpreter converts the print data into a form suitable for marking
   on the media.

   The media resides in Input sub-units from which the media is selected
   and then transported via a Media Path first to a Marking sub-unit and
   then onto an Output sub-unit with (optionally) some finishing
   operations being performed.  The auxiliary sub-units facilitate
   control of the printer, inquiry/control of the operator panel,
   reporting of alerts, and the adaptation of the printer to various
   natural languages and characters sets. All the software sub-units run
   on the System Controller which represents the processor, memory and
   storage systems of the Printer.  Each of the sub-units is discussed
   in more detail below.

   All of the sub-units other than the Alerts report only state
   information, either a description or a status. The Alerts sub-unit
   reports event information.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Printer%20Sub-Units"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Printer Sub-Units</span>

   A printer is composed of 13 types of sub-units, called groups.  The
   following sections describe the different types of sub-units.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.1.%20%20General%20Printer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.1" name="section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  General Printer</span>

   The general printer sub-unit is responsible for the overall control
   and status of the printer. There is exactly one general printer sub-
   unit in a printer. The general printer sub-unit is represented by the
   General Printer Group in the model. In addition to the providing the
   status of the whole printer and allowing the printer to be reset,
   this Group provides information on the status of the packaging of the
   printer, in particular, the covers. The general printer sub-unit is
   usually implemented on the system controller.

   The localization portion of the general printer sub-unit is
   responsible for identifying the natural language, country, and
   character set in which character strings are expressed. There may be
   one or more localizations supported per printer. The available
   localizations are represented by the Localization table.

   Localization is only performed on those strings in the MIB that are
   explicitely marked as being localized.  All other character strings
   are returned in ASCII.

   The character set portion of the general printer sub-unit is
   responsible for identifying the possible character sets that are used
   by the interpreters, the operator console, and in network management
   requests for display objects. There may be one or more character sets
   per printer.  The understood character sets are represented by the
   Character Set Table.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.2.%20%20Inputs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2" name="section-2.2.2">2.2.2</a>.  Inputs</span>

   Input sub-units are mechanisms that feed media to be marked on into
   the printer. A printer contains one or more input sub-units. These
   are represented by the Input Group in the model. The model does not
   distinguish fixed input bins from removable trays, except to report
   when a removable tray has been removed.

   There are as many input sub-units as there are distinctly selectable
   input "addresses".  For example, if a tray has an option for manually
   feeding paper as well as automatically feeding from the tray, then
   this is two input sub-units if these two sources can be (must be)
   separately selected and is one input sub-unit if putting a sheet in
   the manual feed slot overrides feeding from the contents of the tray;
   that is, in the second case there is no way to separately select or
   address the manual feed slot.

   An input sub-unit can hold one or more instances of the media on
   which marking is to be done. Typically, there is a large set of
   possible media that can be associated with an input. The Media Group
   is an extension of the Input Group which represents that media that
   is in an input sub-unit. The Media Group only describes the current
   contents of each input and not the possible content of the input
   sub-unit.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.4.%20%20Outputs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.4" name="section-2.2.4">2.2.4</a>.  Outputs</span>

   Output sub-units are mechanisms that receive media that has been
   marked on. A printer contains one or more output mechanisms. These
   are represented by the Output Group in the model. The model does not
   distinguish fixed output bins from removable output bins, except to
   report when a removable bin has been removed.

   There are as many output sub-units as there are distinctly selectable
   output "addresses".  Output sub-units can be addressed in two

   different ways: (1) as a set of "mailboxes" which are addressed by a
   specific mailbox selector such as a bin number or a bin name, or (2)
   as a set of "slots" into which multiple copies are collated.
   Sometimes both modes of using the output sub-units can be used on the
   same printer.  All that is important from the viewpoint of the model
   is that the output units can be separately selected.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.5.%20%20Finishers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.5" name="section-2.2.5">2.2.5</a>.  Finishers</span>

   A finisher is a sub-unit that performs some operations on the media
   other than marking.  The finisher sub-units are represented by the
   Finisher Group in the model.  Some examples of finishing processes
   are stapling, punching, binding, inserting, or folding.  Finishing
   processes may have supplies asssociated with the process.  Stapling,
   binding, and punching are examples of processes that have supplies. A
   printer may have more than one finishing sub-unit and each finishing
   sub-unit may be associated with one or more output sub-units.
   Finishers are not described in this MIB.

   The exact interaction and sequencing between an output device and its
   associated finisher is not specified by the model. It depends on the
   type of finishing process and the exact implementation of the printer
   system. This standard allows for the logical association of a
   finishing process with an output device but does not put any
   restrictions on the exact sequence or interaction with the associated
   output device. The output and finisher sub-units may or may not be
   separate identifiable physical mechanisms depending on the exact
   implementation of a printer.  In addition, a single output device may
   be associated with multiple finishing sub-units and a single
   finishing sub-unit may be associated with multiple output devices.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.6.%20%20Markers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.6" name="section-2.2.6">2.2.6</a>.  Markers</span>

   A marker is the mechanism that produces marks on the print media. The
   marker sub-units and their associated supplies are represented by the
   Marker Group in the model. A printer can contain one or more marking
   mechanisms.  Some examples of multiple marker sub-units are: a
   printer with separate markers for normal and magnetic ink or an
   imagesetter that can output to both a proofing device and final film.
   Each marking device can have its own set of  characteristics
   associated with it, such as marking technology and resolution.

   In this model the marker sub-unit is viewed as very generalized and
   encompasses all aspects of a marking process. For example, in a
   xero-graphic process, the marking process as well as the fusing
   process would be included in the generalized concept of the marker.
   With the generalized concept of a marking process, the concept of
   multiple marking supplies associated with a single marking sub-unit

   results. For example, in the xerographic process, there is not only a
   supply of toner, but there can also be other supplies such as a fuser
   supply that can be consumed and replaced separately. In addition
   there can be multiple supplies of toner for a single marker device,
   as in a color process.

   The media paths encompass the mechanisms in the printer that move the
   media through the printer and connect all other media related sub-
   units: inputs, outputs, markers and finishers. A printer contains one
   or more media paths. These are represented by the Media Path Group in
   the model.  The Media Path group has some objects that apply to all
   paths plus a table of the separate media paths.

   In general, the design of the media paths determines the maximum
   speed of the printer as well as the maximum media size that the
   printer can handle. Media paths are complex mechanisms and can
   contain many different identifiable sub-mechanisms such as media
   movement devices, media buffers, duplexing units and interlocks. Not
   all of the various sub-mechanisms reside on every media path.  For
   example, one media path may provide printing only on one surface of
   the media (a simplex path) and another media path may have a sub-
   mechanism that turns the media over and feeds it a second time
   through the marker sub-unit (a duplex path).  The duplex path may
   even have a buffer sub-mechanism that allows multiple copies of the
   obverse side to be held before the reverse side of all the copies are
   marked.

   The System Controller is the sub-unit upon which the software
   components of the Printer run. The System Controller is represented
   in the model by the Host MIB. This MIB allows for the specification
   of the processor(s), memory, disk storage, file system and other
   underlying sub-mechanisms of the printer. The controller can range
   from simple single processor systems to multiprocessor systems. In
   addition, controllers can have a full range of resources such as hard
   disks. The printer is modeled to have one system controller even
   though it may have more than one processor and multiple other
   resources associated with it.

   An interface is the communications port and associated protocols that
   are responsible for the transport of data to the printer. A printer
   has one or more interface sub-units. The interfaces are represented
   by the Interfaces Group of MIB-II (<a href="rfc1213.html">RFC 1213</a>). Some examples of

   interfaces are serial ports (with little or no protocol) and EtherNet

   The channel sub-units identify the independent sources of print data
   (here print data is the information that is used to construct printed
   pages and may have both data and control aspects).  A printer may
   have one or more channels. The channel sub-units are represented by
   the Channel Group in the Model. Each channel is typically identified
   by the electronic path and service protocol used to deliver print
   data to the printer. A channel sub-unit may be independently enabled
   (allowing print data to flow) or disabled (stopping the flow of print
   data). It has a current Control Language which can be used to specify
   which interpreter is to be used for the print data and to query and
   change environment variables used by the interpreters (and SNMP).
   There is also a default interpreter that is to be used if an
   interpreter is not explicitly specified using the Control Language.
   Channel sub-units are based on an underlying interface.

   The interpreter sub-units are responsible for the conversion of a
   description of intended print instances into images that are to be
   marked on the media. A printer may have one or more interpreters. The
   interpreter sub-units are represented by the Interpreter Group in the
   Model. Each interpreter is generally implemented with software
   running on the System Controller sub-unit. The Interpreter Table has
   one entry per interpreter where the interpreters include both Page
   Description Language (PDL) Interpreters and Control Language
   Interpreters.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.12.%20%20Console"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.12" name="section-2.2.12">2.2.12</a>.  Console</span>

   Many printers have a console on the printer, the operator console,
   that is used to display and modify the state of the printer.  The
   console can be as simple as a few indicators and switches or as
   complicated as full screen displays and keyboards. There can be at
   most one such console.  This console sub-unit is represented by the
   Console Group in the model.  Although most of the information
   displayed there is also available in the state of the printer as
   represented by the various Groups, it is useful to be able to query
   and modify the operator console remotely.  For example, a management
   application might like to display to its user the current message on
   the operator console of the remote printer or the management
   application user might like to modify the current message on the
   operators console of the remote printer.  As another example, one
   might have a remote application that puts up a pseudo console on a

   workstation screen. Since the rules by which the printer state is
   mapped onto the console and vice versa are not standardized, it is
   not possible to reproduce the console state or the action of console
   buttons and menus. Therefore, the Console Group provides access to
   the console. The operator console is usually implemented on the
   system controller with additional hardware for input and display.

   The alert sub-unit is responsible for detecting reportable events,
   making an entry in the alert table and, if and only if the event is a
   critical event, initiating a trap. The alert sub-unit is represented
   by the Alerts Group and, in particular, the Alert Table. This table
   contains information on the severity, sub-unit, detailed location
   within the sub-unit, alert code and description of each critical
   alert that is currently active within the printer. Each reportable
   event causes an entry to be made in the Alert Table.

   Summary information about the state of the printer is reported at
   three separate levels: (1) there is the status of the printer as a
   whole reported in the Host MIB, (2) there is the status of various
   sub-units reported in the principle table of the Group that
   represents the sub-unit, and (3) there are alert codes reported in
   the Alert Table.

   Of the many states a printer can be in, certain states are more
   "interesting" because of the distinct actions they are likely to
   provoke in the administrator.  These states may be applied to the
   printer as a whole, or to a particular sub-unit of the printer.
   These named states are:

   Non Critical Alert Active - For the printer this means that one or
   more sub-units have a non-critical alert active.  For a sub-unit,
   this means that the sub-unit has a non-critical alert active.

   Critical Alert Active - For the printer this means that one or more
   sub-units have a critical alert active.  For a sub-unit, this means
   that the sub-unit has a critical alert active.

   Unavailable - The printer or sub-unit is unavailable for use (this is
   the same as "broken" or "down" in other terminologies).  A trained
   service person is typically necessary to make it available.

   Busy / Temporarily Unavailable - The printer or sub-unit is
   operational but currently occupied with a request for activity. The
   sub-unit will become available without the need of human interaction.

   Moving on-line or off-line - The printer is either off-line, in the
   process of moving off-line or in the process of moving back on-line;
   for example on high end printers reloading paper involves a
   transition to off-line to open the paper bin, it is then filled and,
   finally, there is a transition back to on-line as the paper bin is
   repositioned for printing.

   Standby - The printer or sub-unit is unavailable for use because it
   is partially powered down and may need some period of time to become
   fully operational again.  A unit in Standby state shall respond to
   network management requests.

   The Host MIB provides three status objects that can be used to
   describe the status of a printer: (1) hrDeviceStatus in the entry in
   the Host MIB hrDeviceTable; (2) hrPrinterStatus in the
   hrPrinterTable; and (3) hrPrinterDetectedErrorState in the
   hrPrinterTable.  These objects describe many of the states that a
   printer can be in.  The following table shows how the "interesting"
   states named above can be recognized by inspecting the values of the
   three printer-related objects in the Host MIB:

Printer     hrDeviceStatus  hrPrinterStatus  hrPrinterDetectedErrorState

   These named states are only a subset of the possible states - they
   are not an exhaustive list of the possible states.  Nevertheless,
   several things should be noted.  When using these states, it is not
   possible to detect when both critical and non-critical alerts are
   pending - if both are pending, the Critical Alert Active state will
   prevail.  In addition, a printer in the Standby state will be
   represented in the Host MIB with a device status of running(2) and a
   printer status of other(1), a set of states that don't uniquely
   distinguish this important printer state.

   Although the above mapping is workable, it would be improved with a
   few additions to hrDeviceStatus and hrPrinterStatus in the Host
   Resources MIB. In particular, it would be appropriate to add a
   "standby" enumeration to hrDeviceStatus.  Similarly, it would be
   useful to add the following states to hrPrinterStatus: "offline" to
   indicate that reason for the printer being down (instead of having to
   use "other") which allows both "warning" and "offline" to indicate
   going offline and "down" and "offline" to indicate offline and
   "notApplicable" to cover cases, such as "standby", where the device
   state completely describes the state of the device.

   Detailed status per sub-unit is reported in the sub-unit status
   fields.

   Sub-unit status is reported in the entries of the principle table in
   the Group that represents the sub-unit. For sub-units that report a
   status, there is a status column in the table and the value of this
   column is always an integer formed in the following way.

   The SubUnitStatus is an integer that is the sum of 5 distinct values,
   Availability, Non-Critical, Critical, On-line, and Transitioning.
   These values are:

   The Alert Group consists of a single table in which all active alerts
   are represented.  This section provides and overview of the table and
   a description of how it is managed.  The basic content of the alert
   table is the severity (critical or non-critical) of the alert, the
   Group and entry where a state change caused the alert, additional
   information about the alert (a more detailed location, an alert code,
   and a description), and an indication of the level of training needed
   to service the alert.

   The Alert Table contains some information that is redundant, for
   example that an event has occurred, and some information that is only
   represented in the Alert Table, for example the additional
   information.  A single table was used because a single entry in a
   Group could cause more than one alert, for example paper jams in more
   than one place in a media path. Associating the additional
   information with the entry in the affected group would only allow one
   report where associating the additional information with the alert
   makes multiple reports possible.

   Every time an alert occurs in the printer, the printer makes one or
   more entries into the Alert Table. The printer determines if an event
   is to be classified as critical or non-critical. If the severity of
   the Alert is "critical", the printer sends a trap or event
   notification to the host indicating that the table has changed.
   Whether or not a trap is sent, the management application is expected
   to poll the printer on a regular basis and to read and parse the
   table to determine what conditions have changed, in order to provide
   reliable information to the management application user.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.13.4.%20%20Alert%20Table%20Management"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.13.4" name="section-2.2.13.4">2.2.13.4</a>.  Alert Table Management</span>

   The alert tables are sparsely populated tables. This means the tables
   will only contain entries of the alerts that are currently active and
   the number of rows, or entries in the table will be dynamic. More
   than one event can be added or removed from the event tables at a
   time depending on the implementation of the printer.

   There are basically two kinds of events that produce alerts: binary
   change events and simple change events. Binary change events come in
   pairs: the leading edge event and the trailing edge event. The
   leading edge event enters a state from which there is only one exit;
   for example, going from running to stopped with a paper jam. The only
   exit from this state is fixing the paper jam and it is clear when
   that is accomplished.  The trailing edge event is the event which
   exits the state the was entered by the leading edge event; in the
   example above fixing the paper jam is the trailing edge event.

   It is relatively straightforward to manage binary change events in
   the Alert Table. Only the leading edge event makes an entry in the
   alert table.  This entry persists in the Alert Table until the
   trailing edge event occurs at which point this event is signal by the
   removal of the leading edge event entry in the Alert Table.  That is,
   a trailing edge event does not create an entry; it removes the
   corresponding leading edge event. With binary events it is possible
   to compute the maximum number that can occur at the same time and
   construct an Alert Table that would hold that many events. There
   would be no possibility of table overflow and no information about
   outstanding events would be lost.

   Unfortunately, there are some events that are not binary changes.
   This other category of event, the simple change event,  is
   illustrated by the configuration change event. With this kind of
   event the state of the machine has changed, but to a state which is
   (often) just as valid as the state that was left and from which no
   return is necessary.  For example, an operator may change the paper
   that is in the primary input source from letter to legal. At some
   time in the future the paper may be changed back to letter, but it

   might be changed to executive instead.  This is where the problem
   occurs. It is not obvious how long to keep simple change event
   entries in the Alert Table. It they were never removed, the Alert
   Table would continue to grow indefinitely.

   The agent needs to have an algorithm implemented for the management
   of the alert table, especially in the face of combinations of binary
   and simple alerts that would overflow the storage capaciity of the
   table.  When the table is full and a new alert needs to be added, an
   old alert needs to be deleted.  The alert to be deleted should be
   chosen using the following rules:

    1. Find a non-critical simple alert and delete it.  If there are
       multiple non-critical simple alerts, it is suggested that the
       oldest one be chosen.  If there are no non-critical simple
       alerts, then,

    2. Find a non-critical binary alert and delete it.  If there are
       multiple non-critical binary alerts, it is suggested that the
       oldest one be chosen.  If there are no non-critical binary
       alerts, then,

    3. Find a critical (binary) alert and delete it.  If there are
       multiple critical alerts, it is suggested that the
       oldest one be chosen.  Agent implementors are encouraged to
       provide at least enough storage space for the maximum number
       of critical alerts that could occur simultaneously.  Note that
       all critical alerts are binary.

   Note that because the Alert Index is a monotonically increasing
   integer there will be gaps in the values in the table when an alert
   is deleted.  Such gaps can be detected by the management application
   to indicate that the management application may want to re-acquire
   the Printer state and check for state changes it did not observe in
   the Alert Table.

   Some of the objects in the printer MIB report on the existence of or
   amount of a given resource used with the printer.  Some examples of
   such resources are the size and number of sheets of paper in a paper
   tray or the existence of certain output options.  On some printers
   there are sensors that allow these resources to be sensed.  Other
   printers, however, lack sensors that can detect (all of) the
   properties of the resource.  Because the printer needs to know of the
   existence or properties of these resources for the printer to
   function properly some other way of providing this information is
   needed.  The chosen way to solve this problem is to allow a

   management application to write into objects which hold the
   descriptive or existence values for printers that cannot sense the
   values.  Thus many of the objects in the MIB are given read-write
   access, but a printer implementation might only permit a management
   operation to change the value if the printer could not sense the
   value itself.  Therefore, the ability to change the value of a read-
   write object may depend on the implementation of the agent.  Note
   that even though some objects explicitely state the behaviour of
   conditional ability to change values, any read-write object may act
   that way.

   Generally, an object is given read-write access in the Printer MIB
   specification if:

  1.The object involves installation of a resource that some
    printers cannot themselves detect.  Therefore, external means are
    needed to inform the printer of the installation.  (Here external
    means include using the operator console, or remote management
    application) and

  2.The printer will behave differently if the installation of the
    resource is reported than the printer would if the installation
    were not reported; that is, the object is not to be used
    as a place to put information not used by the printer, i.e., not a
    "PostIt".  Another way of saying this is that the printer believes
    that information given it and acts as if the information were
    true.  For example, on a printer that cannot sense the size, if
    one paper size is loaded, but another size is set into the paper
    size object, then the printer will use the size that was
    set as its current paper size in its imaging and paper handling.

   The printer may get hints that it may not know about the existence or
   properties of certain resources.  For example, a paper tray may be
   removed and re-inserted.  When this removal and insertion happens,
   the printer may either assume that a property, such as the size of
   paper in the tray, has not changed or the printer may change the
   value of the associated object to "unknown", as might be done for the
   amount of paper in the tray.  As long as the printer acts according
   to the value in  the object either strategy is acceptable.

   It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether or not MIB
   object values are persistent across power cycles or cold starts.  It
   is particularly important that the values of the prtMarkerLifeCount
   object persist throughout the lifetime of the printer.  Therefore, if
   the value of any MIB object persists across power cycles, then the
   prtMarkerLifeCount object must also persist.

   This working group has defined several type of enumerations.  These
   enumerations differ in the method employed to control the addition of
   new enumerations.  Throughout this document, references to
   "enumeration (n)", where n can be 1, 2 or 3 can be found in the
   various tables.  The definitions of these types of enumerations are:

  enumeration (1)  All the values are defined in the Printer MIB
     specification (RFC for the Printer MIB).  Additional enumerated
     values require a new RFC.

  enumeration (2)  An initial set of values are defined in the Printer
     MIB specification.  Additional enumerated values are
     registered after review by this working group. The initial
     versions of the MIB will contain the values registered so far.
     After the MIB is approved, additional values will be
     registered through IANA after approval by this working group.

  enumeration (3)  An initial set of values are defined in the Printer
     MIB specification.  Additional enumerated values are
     registered without working group review.  The initial versions of
     the MIB will contain the values registered so far.  After the MIB
     is approved, additional values will be registered

  CodedCharSet ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
      STATUS     current
      DESCRIPTION
         "A coded character set value that specifies both a set of
          characters that may be used and an encoding (as one or more
          octets) that is used to represent the characters in the
          set. These values are to be used to identify the encoding
          employed for strings in the MIB where this is not fixed by
          the MIB.

          Some objects that allow a choice of coded character set
          are: the prtLocalizationCharacterSet object in the
          LocalizationTable and prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetIn.
          The prtGeneralCurrentLocalization and prtConsoleLocalization
          objects in turn contain the index in the LocalizationTable
          of the current localization (country, language, and coded
          character set) of the `description' objects and the console,
          respectively.

          The space of the coded character set enumeration has been
          divide into three regions. The first region (3-999) consists
          of coded character sets that have been standardized by some
          standard setting organization. This region is intended for
          standards that do not have subset implementations. The
          second region (1000-1999) is for the Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646
          coded character sets together with a specification of a (set
          of) sub-repetoires that may occur.  The third region (&gt;1999)
          is intended for vendor specific coded character sets.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1759.html">RFC 1759</a>                      Printer MIB                     March 1995</span>


          NOTE: Unicode and ISO 10646 character coded data may be
          processed and stored in either Big Endian (most significant
          octet first) or Little Endian (least significant octet
          first) order.  Intel x86, VAX, and Alpha/AXP architectures are
          examples of Little Endian processor architectures.
          Furthermore, in environments where either order may occur,
          so-called Unicode BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) character (which is
          ISO 10646 ZERO WIDTH NO BREAK SPACE), coded as FEFF in two
          octets and 0000FEFF in four octets is used at the beginning
          of the data as a signature to indicate the order of the
          following data (See ISO 10646 Annex F).  Thus either
          ordering and BOM may occur in print data streams sent to the
          interpreter.  However, ISO 8824/8825 (ASN.1/BER) used by
          SNMP is quite clear that Big Endian order shall be used and
          BOM shall NOT be used in transmission in the protocol.
          Transmitting Unicode in Big Endian order in SNMP should
          not prove to be a hardship for Little Endian machines,
          since SNMP ASN.1/BER requires integers to be transmitted
          in Big Endian order as well.  So SNMP implementations on
          Little Endian machines are already reversing the order of
          integers to make them Big Endian for transmission via
          SNMP.  Also Unicode characters are usually treated as
          two-octet integers, not short text strings, so that it will
          be straightforward for Little Endian machines to reverse the
          order of Unicode character octets as well before
          transmitting them and after receiving them via the SNMP
          protocol.

          Where a given coded character set may be known by more than
          one name, the most commonly known name is used as the name
          of the enumeration and other names are shown in the
          comments.  The comments also indicate where to find detailed
          information on the coded character set and briefly
          characterize its relationship to other similar coded
          character sets.

          The current list of character sets and their enumerated
          values used to reference them is contained in the IANA
          Character Set registry.  The enum value is indicated by
          the MIBenum entry in the registry.  The enum symbol is
          indicated by the Alias that starts with `cs' for character
          set.

          The IANA character sets registry is available via
          anonymous ftp.

          The ftp server is ftp.isi.edu.
          The subdirectory is /in-notes/iana/assignments/.

-- The Input Media Group
--
-- The Input Media Group supports identification of media installed
-- or available for use on a printing device. Medium resources are
-- identified by name, and include a collection of characteristic
-- attributes that may further be used for selection and management
-- of them. The Input Media group consists of a set of optional
-- "columns" in the Input Table. In this manner, a minimally
-- conforming implementation may choose to not support reporting
-- of media resources if it cannot do so.
--
-- This group is optional.  However, to claim conformance to this
-- group, it is necessary to implement every object in the group.

-- The Channel Group
--
-- Implementation of every object in this group is mandatory.

-- Channels are independent sources of print data. Here,
-- print data is the term used for the information that is
-- used to construct printed pages and may have both data
-- and control aspects. The output of a channel is in a form
-- suitable for input to one of the interpreters as a
-- stream. A channel may be independently enabled (allowing
-- print data to flow) or disabled (stopping the flow of
-- print data). A printer may have one or more channels.
--
-- Basically, the channel abstraction is intended to cover
-- all the aspects of getting the print data to an
-- interpreter. This might include transporting the data
-- from one place to another, it might include (invisible)
-- compression, it might include encoding or packetizing to
-- provide multiple information sources over a single
-- physical interface and it might include filtering
-- characters that were destined for another kind of
-- channel. All of these aspects are hidden in the channel
-- abstraction.(Note some Page Description Languages have
-- compression built into them so "invisible" compression
-- refers to compression done by the transport medium and
-- removed before the data is presented to the interpreter.)
--
-- There are many kinds of channels;some of which are based
-- on networks and others which are not. For example, a
-- channel can be a serial (or parallel) connection; it can
-- be a service, such as the Unix Line Printer Daemon (LPD),
-- offering itself over a network connection (interface); or
-- it could be a disk drive into which a floppy disks with
-- the print data is inserted. Each channel is typically
-- identified by the electronic path and/or service protocol
-- used to deliver print data to the printer.
--
-- Channel example                   Implementation
--
-- serial port channel            bi-directional data channel
-- parallel port channel          often uni-directional channel
-- IEEE 1284 port channel         bi-directional channel
-- SCSI port channel              bi-directional
-- Apple PAP channel              may be based on Local-, Ether-or
--                                TokenTalk
-- LPD Server channel             typically TCP/IP based, port 515

-- environment variables used by the interpreters (and
-- Mangement Applications). There is also a default
-- interpreter that is to be used if an interpreter is not
-- explicitly specified using the Control Language. Channel
-- sub-units are based on an underlying interface.

--       The channel table and its underlying structure
--
-- The first seven items in the Channel Table define the
-- "channel" itself.  A channel typically depends on other
-- protocols and interfaces to provide the data that flows
-- thru the channel. It is necessary to provide control of
-- the (perhaps complex) process by which print data arrives
-- at an interpreter. Control is largely limited to enabling
-- or disabling the whole channel. It is likely, however,
-- that more control of the process of accessing print data
-- will be needed over time. Thus, the ChannelType will
-- allow type specific data to be associated with each
-- channel (using ChannelType specific groups in a fashion
-- analogous to the media specific MIBs that are associated
-- with the IANAIfType in the Interfaces Table). As a first
-- step in this direction, each channel will identify the
-- underlying Interface on which it is based. This is the
-- eighth object in each row of the table.

-- Some examples of the kind of control are where
-- compression or encoding is used; and whether the data is
-- filtered to remove file storage anomolies such as those
-- created by using MS-DOS/PC-DOS LPT1:.

-- The Alerts Group
--
-- The prtAlertTable lists all the critical and non-critical alerts
-- currently active in the printer.  A critical alert is one that stops
-- the printer from printing immediately and printing can not continue
-- until the critical alert condition is eliminated.  Non-critical
-- alerts are those items that do not stop printing but may at some
-- future time.
-- The table contains information on the severity, component, detail
-- location within the component, alert code and description of each
-- critical alert that is currently active within the printer.  See

        This is an incrementing integer starting from zero
        every time the printer is reset.  When the printer
        adds an alert to the table, that alert is assigned
        the next higher integer value from the last item
        entered into the table.  If the index value reaches
        its maximum value, the next item entered will cause
        the index value to roll over and start at zero
        again.  The first event placed in the alert table
        after a reset of the printer shall
        have an index value of 1.  NOTE: The management
        application will read the alert table when a trap
        or event notification occurs or at a periodic rate
        and then parse the table to determine if any new
        entries were added by comparing the last known index
        value with the current highest index value. The
        management application will then update its copy of
        the alert table.  When the printer discovers that
        an alert is no longer active, the printer shall
        remove the row for that alert from the table and

                      and its sub-units. An example of a technical
                      person would be a manufacture's Field Service

                      representative.
               Trained - Alerts that require an intermediate or moderate
                      level of knowledge of the printer and its
                      sub-units. A typical examples of alerts that
                      a trained operator can handle is replacing
                      toner cartridges.
               Untrained - Alerts that can be fixed without prior
                      training either because the action to correct
                      the alert is obvious or the printer can help the
                      untrained person fix the problem. A typical
                      example of such an alert is reloading paper
                      trays and emptying output bins on a low end
                      printer.
               Management - Alerts that have to do with overall
                      operation of and configuration of the printer.
                      Examples of management events are configuration
                      change of sub-units."

Appendix A - Glossary of Terms

   Addressability -- on the marker, the number of distinctly setable
   marking units (pels) per unit of addressability unit; for example,
   300 dots per inch is expressed as 300 per 1000 Thousandths Of Inches
   and 4 dots per millimeter is 4 per 1000 Micrometers. Addressability
   is not resolution because marks that are one addressability position
   apart may not be independently resolvable by the eye due to factors
   such as gain in the area of marks so they overlap or nearly touch.

   Alert -- a reportable event for which there is an entry in the alert
   table

   Bin -- an output sub-unit which may or may not be removable

   Bursting -- the process by which continuous media is separated into
   individual sheets, typically by bursting along pre-formed
   perforations.

   Channel -- A term used to describe a single source of data which is
   presented to a printer.  The model that we use in describing a
   printer allows for an arbitrary number of channels.  Multiple
   channels can exist on the same physical port.  This is commonly done
   over EtherNet ports where EtherTalk, TCP/IP, and SPX/IPX protocols
   can be supplying different data streams simultaneously to a single
   printer on the same physical port.

   Collation -- in multiple copy output, placing the pages from separate
   copies into separte output bins

   Control Language - a data syntax or language for controlling the
   printer through the print data channel.

   Critical Alert -- an alert triggered by an event which leads to a
   state in which printing is no longer possible; the printer is stopped

   Decollating -- the process by which the individual parts within a
   multi-part form are separated and sorted into separate stacks for
   each part.

   Description -- information about the configuration and capabilities
   of the printer and its various sub-units

   DPA - ISO 10175 Document Printing Application standard.  A standard
   for a client server protocol for a print system, including (1)
   submitting print jobs to and (2) managing print jobs in a spooler

   Event - a state change in the printer

   Group -- a collection of objects that represent a type of sub-unit of
   the printer

   IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.  See STD 2, <a href="rfc1700.html">RFC 1700</a>.

   Idempotent -- Idempotence is the property of an operation that
   results in the same state no matter how many times it is executed (at
   least once).  This is a property that is shared by true databases in
   which operations on data items only change the state of the data item
   and do not have other side effects.  Because the SNMP data model is
   that of operations on a database, SNMP MIB objects should be assumed
   to be idempotent.  If a MIB object is defined in a non-idempotent
   way, the this data model can break in subtle ways when faced with
   packet loss, multiple managers, and other common conditions.

   In order to fulfill the common need for actions to result from SNMP
   Set operations, SNMP MIB objects can be modeled such that the change
   in state from one state to another has the side effect of causing an
   action.  It is important to note that with this model, an SNMP
   operation that sets a value equal to its current value will cause no
   action.  This retains the idempotence of a single command, while
   allowing actions to be initiated by SNMP SET requests.

   For example, a switch like the foot switch that changes from high
   beams to low beams is not idempotent. If the command is received
   multiple times the result may be different than if the command was
   received a single time.  In the SNMP world preferred commands would
   be "set lights to high beam" and "set lights to low beam".  These
   commands yield predictable results when executed perhaps multiple
   times.  A command like "press foot toggle switch", is not idempotent
   because when executed an unknown number of times, it yields an
   indeterminate result.

   Input -- a tray or bin from which instances of the media are obtained
   and fed into the Media Path

   Interpreter - the embodiment of an algorithm that processes a data
   stream consisting of a Page Description Language (PDL) and/or a
   Control Language.

   Localization -- the specification of human language, country, and
   character set needed to present information to people in their native
   languages.

   Management Application (a.k.a. Manager) -- a program which queries
   and controls one or more managed nodes

   Management Station -- a physical computer on which one or more
   management applications can run

   Media Path -- the mechanisms that transport instances of the media
   from an input, through the marker, possibly through media buffers and
   duplexing pathways, out to the output with optional finishing
   applied.  The inputs and outputs are not part of the Media Path.

   MIB - Management Information Base - the specification for a set of
   management objects to be managed using SNMP or other management
   protocol; also an instance of the data for such a set

   Non-critical Alert -- an alert triggered by a reportable event which
   does not lead to a state in which printing is no longer possible;
   such an alert may lead to a state from which printing may no longer
   be possible in the future, such as the low toner state or the alert
   may be pure informational, such as a configuration change at the
   printer.

   Object - a data item that has a name, a syntax, and a value.  usage).

   Output -- a bin or stacker which accepts instances of media that have
   been processed by a printer

   Page Description Language (PDL) - a data syntax or language for the
   electronic representation of a document as a sequence of page images.

   Printer -- a physical device that takes media from an input source,
   produces marks on that media according to some page description or
   page control language and puts the result in some output destination,
   possibly with finishing applied.

   Printing -- the entire process of producing a printed document from
   gen- eration of the file to be printed, choosing printing properties,
   selection of a printer, routing, queuing, resource management,
   scheduling, and finally printing including notifying the user

   Reportable event -- an event that is deemed of interest to a
   management station watching the printer

   Status -- information regarding the current operating state of the
   printer and its various sub-units. This is an abstraction of the
   exact physical condition of the printer.

   Sub-mechanism -- a distinguishable part of a sub-unit

   Sub-unit -- a part of the printer which may be a physical part, such
   as one of the input sources or a logical part such as an interpreter.

Appendix B - Media Size Names from ISO/IEC 10175 Document Printing
             Architecture

   For the convenience of management application developers, this
   appendix lists the standardized media size names from ISO/IEC 10175
   Document Printing Application (DPA). Management applications that
   present a dialogue for choosing or displaying media size are
   encouraged to present relevant names from this list to avoid
   requiring the user to remember the physical dimensions used to
   describe the size of the media. A printer implementing the Printer
   MIB has no knowledge of these names, however; all media sizes in the
   MIB are given in terms of media dimensions as the values of
   prtInputChosenMediaDimFeedDir and prtInputChosen-MediaDimXFeedDir.

Appendix C - Media Names

   For the convenience of management application developers, this
   appendix lists the standardized media names from ISO/IEC 10175
   Document Printing Application (DPA). Management applications that
   present a dialogue for choosing media may wish to use these names as
   an alternative to separately specifying, size, color, and/or type.
   Using standard media names will mean that a single management
   application dealing with printers from different vendors and under
   different system mangers will tend to use the same names for the same
   media. If selection of media by name is used, the attributes (size,
   type or color) implied by the name must be explicitly mapped to the
   appropriate object (prtInputDeclared-MediaDimFeedDir,
   prtInputDeclaredMediaDimXFeedDir, prtInputMediaType and
   prtInputMediaColor) in the MIB. The object prtInputMediaName is
   intended for display to an operator and is purely descriptive. The
   value in prtInputMediaName is not interpreted by the printer so using
   a standard name for this value will not change any of the other media
   attributes nor will it cause an alert if the media in the input sub-
   unit does not match the name.

Background

   The need for Role Models stemmed in large part from the need to
   understand the importance any given managed object under
   consideration for inclusion in the specification.  Many times the
   presence or nature of a particular proposed object would be debated
   within the group; the debate would typically end when one or more
   persons would describe the potential usage for the object, usually in
   terms of a "live" person operating in some target environment.

   Steve Zilles (Adobe) first mentioned that he had considered this
   general problem and had come up with a short list of categories by
   which the group can evaluate the relative utility of a proposed
   object.  The list Steve described was:

    - User

    - Trained Operator

    - Service

   Upon further examination of the overall problem I found it useful to
   expand the list of categories, as well as attempt to define a basic
   set of "requirements areas" that can help define the basic nature of
   each category.

   Every concept needs a name, and this concept is no different.  For
   lack of better alternatives, I refer to these categories as "Role
   Models" in this document.  This name was chosen in light of the fact
   that many times we try to find a "person" (or similar entity) for
   which the use of a proposed object is targeted.  (I resisted the
   temptation to use the term "Usage Models," as I felt the term was too
   generic in nature.)

   In presenting the initial list of Role Models, the initial set of
   "requirements areas" are presented, followed by the set of Role Model
   definitions.  Finally, a simple matrix is presented in which Role
   Models and requirements areas are cross-compared.

   It should be emphasized at this point that all of this is proposed as
   initial information for further discussion.  No doubt major changes

   will be proposed by members of the group as time goes on.

Proposed Print System Requirements Areas

   Surrounding printers and printing systems, the following list of
   "requirement areas" is proposed as a "check list" of needs for the
   various Role Models:

  Printer job state - Determine the status of a job without a printer.
  Printer capabilities - Determine the current capabilities of a
     printer, for example, the available media sizes, two-sided
     printing, a particular type of interpreter, etc.
  Printer job submission - Submit a print job to a printer.
  Printer job removal - Remove a job from a printer.
  Notification of events - Receive notification of the existence of a
     defined printer event.  An event can be of many types, including
     warnings, errors, job stage completion (e.g., "job done"), etc.
  Printer configuration - Query the current configuration of a
     printer.
  Printer consumables - Determine the current state of any and all
     consumables within a printer.
  Print job identification - Determine the identification of a job
     within a printer.
  Internal printer status - Determine the current status of the
     printer.
  Printer identification - Determine the identify of a printer.
  Printer location - Determine the physical location of a printer.
  Local system configuration - Determine various aspects of the
     current configuration of the local system involved with the
     operation of a printer.

   These "requirements" cover a large spectrum of requirements
   surrounding the operation of a printer in a network environment.
   This list is by no means complete, but serves as a starting point for
   assessing major requirements of the various Role Models described
   below.

Proposed Role Models

   Following is a proposed list of "Role Models" to be used in
   evaluating the requirements for any given object defined within the
   Printer MIB.  Note that the keyword enclosed in parentheses
   represents an abbreviation for the particular Role Model in the
   matrix described later in this document.

  User  (USER) - A person or application that submits print jobs to
     the printer; typically viewed as the "end user" within the overall
     printing environment.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1759.html">RFC 1759</a>                      Printer MIB                     March 1995</span>


  Operator  (OP) - A person responsible for maintaining a printer on a
     day-to-day basis, including such tasks as filling empty media
     trays, emptying full output trays, replacing toner cartridges,
     etc.
  Technician  (TECH) - A person responsible for repairing a
     malfunctioning printer, performing routine preventive maintenance,
     and other tasks that typically require advanced training on the
     printer internals.  An example of a "technician" would be a
     manufacturer's Field Service representative, or other person
     formally trained by the manufacturer or similar representative.
  System Manager  (MGR) - A person responsible for configuration and
     troubleshooting of components involved in the overall printing
     environment, including printers, print queues and network
     connectivity issues.  This person is typically responsible for
     ensuring the overall operational integrity of the print system
     components, and is typically viewed as the central point of
     coordination among all other Role Models.
  Help Desk  (HELP) - A person responsible for supporting Users in
     their printing needs, including training Users and troubleshooting
     Users' printing problems.
  Asset Manager  (AM) - A person responsible for managing an
     organizations printing system assets (primarily printers).  Such a
     person needs to be able to identify and track the location of
     printing assets on an ongoing basis.
  Capacity Planner  (CP) - A person responsible for tracking the usage
     of printing resources on an ongoing basis.  An optional related
     activity might be to acquire printing resource utilization
     information for the purposes of charging Users for resources used.
  Installer  (INST) - A person or application responsible for
     installing or configuring printing system components on a local
     system.

   The purpose of these Role Models is to evaluate the relative merit of
   any given managed object.  Whenever a managed object is proposed for
   inclusion into the specification, discussion on its expected value
   should be geared around which Role Models benefit from its presence
   and operation.

Matrix of Requirement Areas and Role Models

   To better understand the relationship between the set of defined
   "Requirements Areas" and the various "Role Models," the following
   matrix is offered.

   It is important to recognize that many of the requirements areas will
   appear to be applicable to many of the Role Models.  However, when
   considering the actual context of a requirement area, it is very
   important to realize that often the actual context of a requirement



<span class="grey">Smith, Wright, Hastings, Zilles &amp; Gyllenskog                  [Page 109]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-110" id="page-110" name="page-110"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1759.html">RFC 1759</a>                      Printer MIB                     March 1995</span>


   is such the Role Model can change.

   For example, it is obvious that a "System Manager" must be able to
   submit print jobs to a printer; however, when submitting a print job
   a person identified as a "System Manager" is actually operating in
   the context of a "User" in this case; hence, the requirement to
   submit a print job is not listed as a requirement for a System
   Manager.

   Conversely, while a "User" must be able to remove a job previously
   submitted to a printer, an "Operator" is often expected to be able to
   remove any print job from any printer; hence, print job removal is a
   (subtly different) requirement for both "User" and an "Operator" Role
   Models.

   That being said, I'm sure you'll find some inconsistencies in the
   following matrix, depending on your particular interpretations of the
   various requirements areas.

                       Role Models
