Abstract

   This document describes the certificate policy for a Public Key
   Infrastructure (PKI) used to support attestations about Internet
   Number Resource (INR) holdings.  Each organization that distributes
   IP addresses or Autonomous System (AS) numbers to an organization
   will, in parallel, issue a (public key) certificate reflecting this
   distribution.  These certificates will enable verification that the
   resources indicated in the certificate have been distributed to the
   holder of the associated private key and that this organization is
   the current, unique holder of these resources.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document describes the certificate policy for a Public Key
   Infrastructure (PKI) used to attest to Internet Number Resource (INR)
   holdings (IP addresses or Autonomous System (AS) numbers).  An
   organization that distributes INRs to another organization MAY, in
   parallel, issue a (public key) certificate reflecting this
   distribution.  These certificates will enable verification that the
   resources indicated in the certificate have been distributed to the
   holder of the associated private key and that this organization is
   the current holder of these resources.

   The most important and distinguishing aspect of the PKI for which
   this policy was created is that it does not purport to identify an
   INR holder via the subject name contained in the certificate issued
   to that entity.  Rather, each certificate issued under this policy is
   intended to enable an entity to assert, in a verifiable fashion, that
   it is the current holder of an INR based on the current records of
   the entity responsible for the resources in question.  Verification
   of the assertion is based on two criteria: the ability of the entity
   to digitally sign data that is verifiable using the public key
   contained in the corresponding certificate, and validation of that
   certificate in the context of this PKI.

   This PKI is designed exclusively for use in support of validation of
   claims related to current INR holdings.  This includes any
   certificates issued in support of operation of this infrastructure,
   e.g., for integrity or access control of the repository system
   described in <a href="#section-2.4">Section 2.4</a>.  Such transitive uses of certificates also
   are permitted under this policy.  Use of the certificates and
   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) managed under this PKI for any
   other purpose is a violation of this CP, and relying parties (RPs)
   SHOULD reject certificates presented for such uses.

   Note: This document is based on the template specified in <a href="rfc3647.html">RFC 3647</a>
   [<a href="rfc3647.html" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification Practices Framework"'>RFC3647</a>], a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
   stream.  In the interest of keeping the document as short as
   reasonable, a number of sections contained in the template have been
   omitted from this policy because they do not apply to this PKI.
   However, we have retained the section numbering scheme employed in
   <a href="rfc3647.html">RFC 3647</a> to facilitate comparison with the outline in <a href="rfc3647.html#section-6">Section 6 of
   RFC 3647</a>.  Each of these omitted sections should be read as "No
   stipulation" in Certificate Policy (CP) / Certification Practice
   Statement (CPS) parlance.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Overview</span>

   This PKI is designed to support validation of claims by current
   holders of INRs, in accordance with the records of the organizations
   that act as Certification Authorities (CAs) in this PKI.  The ability
   to verify such claims is essential to ensuring the unambiguous
   distribution of these resources [<a href="rfc6480.html" title='"An Infrastructure to Support Secure Internet Routing"'>RFC6480</a>].

   The structure of the RPKI is congruent with the number resource
   allocation framework of the Internet.  The IANA allocates number
   resources to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), to others, and for
   special purposes [<a href="rfc5736.html" title='"IANA IPv4 Special Purpose Address Registry"'>RFC5736</a>].  The RIRs, in turn, manage the allocation
   of number resources to end users, Internet Service Providers, and
   others.

   This PKI encompasses several types of certificates (see [<a href="rfc6487.html" title='"A Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates"'>RFC6487</a>] for
   more details):

   o  CA certificates for each organization distributing INRs and for
      INR holders

   o  End-entity (EE) certificates for organizations to validate digital
      signatures on RPKI signed objects

   Note that in a PKI, the term "subscriber" refers to an individual or
   organization that is a subject of a certificate issued by a CA.  The
   term is used in this fashion throughout this document, without
   qualification, and should not be confused with the networking use of
   the term to refer to an individual or organization that receives
   service from an ISP.  In such cases, the term "network subscriber"
   will be used.  Also note that, for brevity, this document always
   refers to PKI participants as organizations or entities, even though
   some of them are individuals.

   The organizations that distribute IP addresses and AS numbers (IANA,
   RIRs, NIRs, ISPs) act as CAs in this PKI.

   Organizations that do not distribute INRs but hold such resources
   also act as CAs when they create EE certificates.

   This PKI does not require establishment or use of a registration
   authority (RA) function separate from the one provided inherently in
   conjunction with the CA function.  The RA function MUST be provided
   by the same entity operating as a CA, e.g., entities listed in
   <a href="#section-1.3.1">Section 1.3.1</a>.  An entity acting as a CA in this PKI already has a
   formal relationship with each organization to which it distributes
   INRs.  These entities (the CAs) already perform the RA function
   implicitly since they already assume responsibility for distributing
   INRs.

   These are the organizations receiving distributions of INRs: RIRs,
   NIRs, ISPs, and other organizations.

   Note that any of these organizations may have received distributions
   from more than one source over time.  This is true even for RIRs,
   which participate in inter-registry exchanges of address space.  This
   PKI accommodates such relationships.

   Entities or individuals that act in reliance on certificates or RPKI
   signed objects issued under this PKI are relying parties.  Relying
   parties may or may not be subscribers within this PKI.  (See <a href="#section-1.6">Section</a>

   Every organization that undertakes a role as a CA in this PKI is
   responsible for populating the RPKI distributed repository system
   with the certificates, CRLs, and RPKI signed objects that it issues.
   The organization MAY operate its own publication point, or it MAY
   outsource this function (see Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> and <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a>).

   CPS -  Certification Practice Statement.  A CPS is a document that
          specifies the practices that a Certification Authority (CA)
          employs in issuing certificates in this PKI.

   Distribution of INRs - A process of distribution of the INRs along
          the respective number hierarchy.  IANA distributes blocks of
          IP addresses and AS numbers to the five Regional Internet
          Registries (RIRs).  RIRs distribute smaller address blocks and
          AS numbers to organizations within their service regions, who
          in turn distribute IP addresses to their customers.

   IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.  IANA is responsible for
          global coordination of the IP addressing system and AS numbers
          used for routing Internet traffic.  IANA distributes INRs to
          Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).

   INRs - Internet Number Resources.  INRs are number values for three
          protocol parameter sets, namely:

          o  IP version 4 addresses,

          o  IP version 6 addresses, and

          o  Identifiers used in Internet inter-domain routing,
             currently Border Gateway Protocol-4 AS numbers.

   ISP -  Internet Service Provider.  This is an organization managing
          and providing Internet services to other organizations.

   LIR -  Local Internet Registry.  In some regions, this term is used
          to refer to what is called an ISP in other regions.

   NIR -  National Internet Registry.  This is an organization that
          manages the distribution of INRs for a portion of the
          geopolitical area covered by a Regional Registry.  NIRs form
          an optional second tier in the tree scheme used to manage
          INRs.

   RIR -  Regional Internet Registry.  This is an organization that
          manages the distribution of INRs for a geopolitical area.

   RPKI signed object - An RPKI signed object is a digitally signed data
          object (other than a certificate or CRL) that is declared to
          be such by a Standards Track RFC, and that can be validated
          using certificates issued under this PKI.  The content and
          format of these data constructs depend on the context in which
          validation of claims of current holdings of INRs takes place.
          Examples of these objects are repository manifests [<a href="rfc6486.html" title='"Manifests for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)"'>RFC6486</a>]
          and Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) [<a href="rfc6482.html" title='"A Profile for Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)"'>RFC6482</a>].

   Certificates, CRLs, and RPKI signed objects (intended for public
   consumption) MUST be made available for downloading by all relying
   parties, to enable them to validate this data.  This motivates use of
   a robust, distributed repository system.  Each CA MUST maintain a
   publicly accessible online repository and publish all RPKI-signed
   objects (intended for public consumption) via this repository in a
   manner that conforms with "A Profile for Resource Certificate
   Repository Structure" [<a href="rfc6481.html" title='"A Profile for Resource Certificate Repository Structure"'>RFC6481</a>].  (This function MAY be outsourced,
   as noted in <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a> below.)  The collection of repositories forms
   the RPKI distributed repository system.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Publication%20of%20Certification%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Publication of Certification Information</span>

   Each CA MUST publish the certificates (intended for public
   consumption) that it issues via the repository system.

   Each CA MUST publish the CRLs (intended for public consumption) that
   it issues via the repository system.

   Each CA MUST publish its RPKI signed objects (intended for public
   consumption) via the repository system.

   Each CA that issues certificates to entities outside of its
   administrative domain SHOULD create and publish a CPS that meets the
   requirements set forth in this CP.  Publication means that the
   entities to which the CA issues certificates MUST be able to acquire
   a copy of the CPS, and MUST be able to ascertain when the CPS
   changes.  (An organization that does not allocate or assign INRs does
   not need to create or publish a CPS.)

   An organization MAY choose to outsource publication of RPKI data --
   certificates, CRLs, and other RPKI signed objects.

   The CP will be published as an IETF-stream RFC and will be available
   from the RFC repository.

   The CPS for each CA MUST specify the following information:

   The period of time within which a certificate will be published after
   the CA issues the certificate.

   The period of time within which a CA will publish a CRL with an entry
   for a revoked certificate after it revokes that certificate.

   Expired and revoked certificates SHOULD be removed from the RPKI
   repository system, upon expiration or revocation, respectively.
   Also, please note that each CA MUST publish its CRL prior to the
   nextUpdate value in the scheduled CRL previously issued by the CA.

   Each CA or repository operator MUST implement access controls to
   prevent unauthorized persons from adding, modifying, or deleting
   repository entries.  A CA or repository operator MUST NOT
   intentionally use technical means of limiting read access to its CPS,
   certificates, CRLs, or RPKI signed objects.  This data is intended to
   be accessible to the public.

   The distinguished name for every CA and end-entity consists of a
   single CommonName (CN) attribute with a value generated by the issuer
   of the certificate.  Optionally, the serialNumber attribute MAY be
   included along with the common name (to form a terminal relative
   distinguished name set), to distinguish among successive instances of
   certificates associated with the same entity.

   The subject name in each certificate SHOULD NOT be "meaningful",
   i.e., the name is not intended to convey the identity of the subject
   to relying parties.  The rationale here is that certificates issued
   under this PKI are used for authorization in support of applications
   that make use of attestations of INR holdings.  They are not used to
   identify subjects.

   Although subject (and issuer) names need not be meaningful, and may

   explicit support for this feature is provided.

   There is no guarantee that subject names are globally unique in this
   PKI.  Each CA certifies subject names that MUST be unique among the
   certificates it issues.  Although it is desirable that these subject
   names be unique throughout the PKI, name uniqueness within the RPKI
   cannot be guaranteed.

   However, subject names in certificates SHOULD be constructed in a way
   that minimizes the chances that two entities in the RPKI will be
   assigned the same name.  The RPKI Certificate Profile [<a href="rfc6487.html" title='"A Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates"'>RFC6487</a>]
   provides an example of how to generate (meaningless) subject names in
   a way that minimizes the likelihood of collisions.

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI MUST require each
   subject to demonstrate proof of possession (PoP) of the private key
   corresponding to the public key in the certificate, prior to issuing
   the certificate.  The means by which PoP is achieved is determined by
   each CA and MUST be declared in the CPS of that CA.

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI MUST employ
   procedures to ensure that each certificate it issues accurately
   reflects its records with regard to the organization to which the CA
   has distributed the INRs identified in the certificate.  The specific
   procedures employed for this purpose MUST be described by the CPS for
   each CA.  Relying parties can expect each CA to employ procedures
   commensurate with those it already employs as a registry or ISP in
   the management of the INRs.  This authentication is solely for use by
   each CA in dealing with the organizations to which it distributes
   INRs, and thus should not be relied upon outside of this
   CA-subscriber relationship.

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI MUST employ
   procedures to ensure that an organization requesting a re-key after
   revocation is the same entity to which the revoked certificate was
   issued and is the legitimate holder of the associated INR.  The CA
   MUST require PoP of the private key corresponding to the new public
   key.  The specific procedures employed for these purposes MUST be
   described by the CPS for the CA.  With respect to authentication of
   the holder of the INRs, relying parties can expect each CA to employ
   procedures commensurate with those it already employs as a registry
   or ISP, in the management of INRs.  Note that there MAY be different
   procedures for the case where the legitimate subject still possesses
   the original private key as opposed to the case when it no longer has
   access to that key.

   Each CA operating within the context of this PKI MUST employ
   procedures to ensure that:

   o  an organization requesting revocation is the legitimate holder of
      the certificate to be revoked.

   o  each certificate it revokes accurately reflects its records with
      regard to the organization to which the CA has distributed the
      INRs identified in the certificate.

   o  an individual claiming to represent an organization for which a
      certificate is to be revoked is authorized to represent that

   Any entity that distributes INRs SHOULD acquire a certificate.  This
   includes Internet Registries and ISPs.  Additionally, entities that
   hold INRs from an Internet Registry, or that are multi-homed, MAY
   acquire a certificate under this PKI.  The (CA) certificates issued

   Existing practices employed by registries and ISPs to identify and

   issuance of certificates to these subscribers.  It is important to
   note that the Resource PKI SHOULD NOT be used to authenticate the
   identity of an organization, but rather to bind subscribers to the
   INRs they hold.  Because identity is not being vouched for by this
   PKI, certificate application procedures need not verify legal
   organization names, etc.

   Reliance on a certificate must be reasonable under the circumstances.
   If the circumstances indicate a need for additional assurances, the
   relying party must obtain such assurances in order for such reliance
   to be deemed reasonable.

   Before any act of reliance, relying parties MUST independently (1)
   verify that the certificate will be used for an appropriate purpose
   that is not prohibited or otherwise restricted by this CP (see
   <a href="#section-1.4">Section 1.4</a>), and (2) assess the status of the certificate and all
   the certificates in the chain (terminating at a trust anchor (TA)
   accepted by the RP) that issued the certificates relevant to the
   certificate in question.  If any of the certificates in the
   certificate chain have been revoked or have expired, the relying
   party is solely responsible for determining whether reliance on a
   digital signature to be verified by the certificate in question is
   acceptable.  Any such reliance is made solely at the risk of the
   relying party.

   If a relying party determines that use of the certificate is
   appropriate, the relying party must utilize appropriate software
   and/or hardware to perform digital signature verification as a
   condition of relying on the certificate.  Moreover, the relying party
   MUST validate the certificate in a manner consistent with the RPKI
   Certificate Profile [<a href="rfc6487.html" title='"A Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates"'>RFC6487</a>], which specifies the extended
   validation algorithm for RPKI certificates.

   This section describes the procedures for certificate renewal.
   Certificate renewal is the issuance of a new certificate to replace

   serial number (the field in the certificate, not the DN attribute)
   are changed.  The public key and all other information remain the

   A certificate MUST be processed for renewal based on its expiration
   date or a renewal request from the subscriber.  Prior to the
   expiration of an existing subscriber's certificate, it is the
   responsibility of the subscriber to renew the certificate to maintain
   continuity of certificate usage.  If the issuing CA initiates the
   renewal process based on the certificate expiration date, then that
   CA MUST notify the holder in advance of the renewal process.  The
   validity interval of the new (renewed) certificate SHOULD overlap
   that of the previous certificate to ensure continuity of certificate
   usage.  It is RECOMMENDED that the renewed certificate be issued and
   published at least 1 week prior to the expiration of the certificate
   it replaces.

   Certificate renewal SHOULD incorporate the same public key as the
   previous certificate, unless the private key has been reported as
   compromised.  If a new key pair is being used, the stipulations of
   <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a> apply.

   Only the certificate holder or the issuing CA may initiate the
   renewal process.  The certificate holder MAY request an early
   renewal, for example, if it expects to be unavailable to support the
   renewal process during the normal expiration period.  An issuing CA
   MAY initiate the renewal process based on the certificate expiration
   date.

   Renewal procedures MUST ensure that the person or organization
   seeking to renew a certificate is in fact the subscriber (or
   authorized by the subscriber) of the certificate and the legitimate
   holder of the INR associated with the renewed certificate.  Renewal
   processing MUST verify that the certificate in question has not been

   This section describes the procedures for certificate re-key.
   Certificate re-key is the issuance of a new certificate to replace an
   old one because the key needs to be replaced.  Unlike with
   certificate renewal, the public key is changed.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.7.1.%20%20Circumstance%20for%20Certificate%20Re-Key"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.7.1" name="section-4.7.1">4.7.1</a>.  Circumstance for Certificate Re-Key</span>

   Re-key of a certificate SHOULD be performed only when required, based
   on:

   1. knowledge or suspicion of compromise or loss of the associated
      private key, or

   2. the expiration of the cryptographic lifetime of the associated key
      pair

   A CA re-key operation has dramatic consequences, requiring the
   reissuance of all certificates issued by the re-keyed entity.  So it
   should be performed only when necessary and in a way that preserves
   the ability of relying parties to validate certificates whose
   validation path includes the re-keyed entity.  CA key rollover MUST
   follow the procedures defined in "CA Key Rollover in the RPKI"
   [<a href="rfc6489.html" title='"CA Key Rollover in the RPKI"'>RFC6489</a>].

   Note that if a certificate is revoked to replace the <a href="rfc3779.html">RFC 3779</a>
   extensions, the replacement certificate MUST incorporate the same
   public key rather than a new key.  This applies when one is adding
   INRs (revocation not required) and when one is removing INRs
   (revocation required (see <a href="#section-4.8.1">Section 4.8.1</a>)).

   If the re-key is based on a suspected compromise, then the previous
   certificate MUST be revoked.

   The holder of the certificate may request a re-key.  In addition, the
   CA that issued the certificate MAY choose to initiate a re-key based
   on a verified compromise report.

   Modification of a certificate occurs to implement changes to selected
   attribute values in a certificate.  In the context of the RPKI, the
   only changes that are accommodated by certificate modification are
   changes to the INR holdings described by the <a href="rfc3779.html">RFC 3779</a> extension(s)
   and changes to the SIA extension.

   When a certificate modification is approved, a new certificate is
   issued.  If no INR holdings are removed from the certificate, the new
   certificate MUST contain the same public key and the same expiration
   date as the original certificate, but with the SIA extension and/or
   the INR set expanded.  In this case, revocation of the previous
   certificate is not required.

   When previously distributed INRs are removed from a certificate, then
   the old certificate MUST be revoked and a new certificate MUST be
   issued, reflecting the changed INR holdings.  (The SIA extension in
   the new certificate will be unchanged, unless the affected INR holder
   supplies a new SIA value.)

   Either the certificate holder or the issuer may initiate the

   specified in a CA's CPS.

   Note:  If new INRs are being added to an organization's existing

   A subscriber MAY submit a request to the certificate issuer for a
   revocation.  This request MUST identify the certificate to be revoked
   and MUST be authenticated.  The procedures for making the request
   MUST be described in the CPS for each CA.  The RPKI provisioning
   document [<a href="rfc6492.html" title='"A Protocol for Provisioning Resource Certificates"'>RFC6492</a>] describes a protocol that MAY be used to make
   revocation requests.

   A certificate issuer MUST notify the subscriber when revoking a
   certificate.  The notification requirement is satisfied by CRL
   publication.  The CPS for a CA MUST indicate the means by which the
   CA will inform a subscriber of certificate revocation.

   In most instances, public key pairs will be generated by the subject,

   some CAs MAY offer to generate key pairs on behalf of their subjects
   at the request of the subjects, e.g., to accommodate subscribers who
   do not have the ability to perform key generation in a secure
   fashion.  (The CA has to check the quality of the keys only if it
   generates them; see <a href="#section-6.1.6">Section 6.1.6</a>.)  Since the keys used in this PKI
   are not for non-repudiation purposes, generation of key pairs by CAs
   does not inherently undermine the security of the PKI.  Each CA MUST
   describe its key pair generation procedures in its CPS.

   has not been altered during transit and that the subscriber possesses
   the private key corresponding to the transferred public key.

   CA public keys for all entities (other than trust anchors) are
   contained in certificates issued by other CAs.  These certificates
   MUST be published in the RPKI distributed repository system.  Relying
   parties download these certificates from the repositories.  Public
   key values and associated data for (putative) trust anchors are
   distributed out of band and accepted by relying parties on the basis
   of locally defined criteria.

   The certificate policy for a typical PKI defines the criteria against
   which prospective CAs are evaluated and establishes requirements that
   they must meet.  In this PKI, the CAs are already authoritative for
   the management of INRs, and the PKI simply supports verification of
   the distribution of these resources to network subscribers.
   Accordingly, whatever audit and other assessments are already used to
   ensure the security of the management of INRs is sufficient for this
   PKI.  The CPS for each CA MUST describe what audits and other
   assessments are used.

   As noted throughout this certificate policy, the organizations
   managing the distribution of INRs are authoritative in their roles as
   managers of this data.  They MUST operate this PKI to allow the
   holders of INRs to generate digitally signed data that attest to
   these distributions.  Therefore, the manner in which the

   this PKI MUST be commensurate with the way in which they already
   manage business and legal matters in their existing roles.  Since

   According to X.509, a certificate policy (CP) is "a named set of
   rules that indicates the applicability of a certificate to a
   particular community and/or class of applications with common
   security requirements." A CP may be used by a relying party to help
   in deciding whether a certificate and the binding therein are
   sufficiently trustworthy and otherwise appropriate for a particular
   application.  This document describes the CP for the Resource Public
   Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  There are separate documents (CPSs) that
   cover the factors that determine the degree to which a relying party
   can trust the binding embodied in a certificate.  The degree to which
   such a binding can be trusted depends on several factors, e.g., the
   practices followed by the CA in authenticating the subject; the CA's
   operating policy, procedures, and technical security controls,
   including the scope of the subscriber's responsibilities (for
   example, in protecting the private key), and the stated
   responsibilities and liability terms and conditions of the CA (for
   example, warranties, disclaimers of warranties, and limitations of
   liability).

   Since name uniqueness within the RPKI cannot be guaranteed, there is
   a risk that two or more CAs in the RPKI will issue certificates and
   CRLs under the same issuer name.  Path validation implementations
   that conform to the resource certification path validation algorithm
   (see [<a href="rfc6487.html" title='"A Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates"'>RFC6487</a>]) verify that the same key was used to sign both the
   target (the resource certificate) and the corresponding CRL.  So, a
   name collision will not change the result.  Use of the basic X.509
   path validation algorithm, which assumes name uniqueness, could
   result in a revoked certificate being accepted as valid or a valid
   certificate being rejected as revoked.  Relying parties must ensure
   that the software they use to validate certificates issued under this
   policy verifies that the same key was used to sign both the
   certificate and the corresponding CRL, as specified in [<a href="rfc6487.html" title='"A Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates"'>RFC6487</a>].
