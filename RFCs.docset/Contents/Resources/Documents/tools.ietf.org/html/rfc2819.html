Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing remote network
   monitoring devices.

   This memo obsoletes <a href="rfc1757.html">RFC 1757</a>. This memo extends that specification by
   documenting the RMON MIB in SMIv2 format while remaining semantically
   identical to the existing SMIv1-based MIB.

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in <a href="rfc2571.html">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>1</a>].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, <a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>2</a>], STD 16, <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>3</a>] and <a href="rfc1215.html">RFC 1215</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>4</a>]. The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a>
      [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>5</a>], <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>6</a>] and <a href="rfc2580.html">RFC 2580</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>7</a>].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>8</a>]. A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in <a href="rfc1901.html">RFC 1901</a> [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"'>9</a>] and RFC

      1906 [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>10</a>]. The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in <a href="rfc1906.html">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>10</a>], <a href="rfc2572.html">RFC 2572</a> [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>11</a>] and <a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a>
      [<a href="#ref-12" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>12</a>].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>8</a>]. A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in <a href="rfc1905.html">RFC 1905</a>
      [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>13</a>].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in <a href="rfc2573.html">RFC 2573</a> [<a href="#ref-14" title='"SNMPv3 Applications"'>14</a>] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in <a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a>
      [<a href="#ref-15" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>15</a>].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in <a href="rfc2570.html">RFC 2570</a> [<a href="#ref-22" title='"Introduction to Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>22</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   Remote network monitoring devices, often called monitors or probes,
   are instruments that exist for the purpose of managing a network.
   Often these remote probes are stand-alone devices and devote
   significant internal resources for the sole purpose of managing a
   network.  An organization may employ many of these devices, one per
   network segment, to manage its internet.  In addition, these devices
   may be used for a network management service provider to access a
   client network, often geographically remote.

   The objects defined in this document are intended as an interface
   between an RMON agent and an RMON management application and are not
   intended for direct manipulation by humans.  While some users may

   tolerate the complexity of manually manipulating objects to
   accomplish row creation.  These functions should be handled by the
   management application.

   While most of the objects in this document are suitable for the
   management of any type of network, there are some which are specific
   to managing Ethernet networks.  These are the objects in the
   etherStatsTable, the etherHistoryTable, and some attributes of the
   filterPktStatus and capturBufferPacketStatus objects.  The design of
   this MIB allows similar objects to be defined for other network
   types.  It is intended that future versions of this document and
   additional documents will define extensions for other network types.

   There are a number of companion documents to the RMON MIB. The Token
   Ring RMON MIB [<a href="#ref-19" title='"Token Ring Extensions to the Remote Network Monitoring MIB"'>19</a>] provides objects specific to managing Token Ring
   networks. The RMON-2 MIB [<a href="#ref-20" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base Version 2 using SMIv2"'>20</a>] extends RMON by providing RMON analysis
   up to the application layer. The SMON MIB [<a href="#ref-21" title='"Remote Network Monitoring MIB Extensions for Switched Networks Version 1.0"'>21</a>] extends RMON by
   providing RMON analysis for switched networks.

   o  Offline Operation
        There are sometimes conditions when a management station will
        not be in constant contact with its remote monitoring devices.
        This is sometimes by design in an attempt to lower
        communications costs (especially when communicating over a WAN
        or dialup link), or by accident as network failures affect the
        communications between the management station and the probe.

        For this reason, this MIB allows a probe to be configured to
        perform diagnostics and to collect statistics continuously, even
        when communication with the management station may not be
        possible or efficient.  The probe may then attempt to notify the
        management station when an exceptional condition occurs.  Thus,
        even in circumstances where communication between management
        station and probe is not continuous, fault, performance, and
        configuration information may be continuously accumulated and
        communicated to the management station conveniently and
        efficiently.

   o  Proactive Monitoring
        Given the resources available on the monitor, it is potentially
        helpful for it continuously to run diagnostics and to log
        network performance.  The monitor is always available at the
        onset of any failure.  It can notify the management station of
        the failure and can store historical statistical information

        about the failure.  This historical information can be played
        back by the management station in an attempt to perform further
        diagnosis into the cause of the problem.

   o  Problem Detection and Reporting
        The monitor can be configured to recognize conditions, most
        notably error conditions, and continuously to check for them.
        When one of these conditions occurs, the event may be logged,
        and management stations may be notified in a number of ways.

   o  Value Added Data
        Because a remote monitoring device represents a network resource
        dedicated exclusively to network management functions, and
        because it is located directly on the monitored portion of the
        network, the remote network monitoring device has the
        opportunity to add significant value to the data it collects.
        For instance, by highlighting those hosts on the network that
        generate the most traffic or errors, the probe can give the
        management station precisely the information it needs to solve a
        class of problems.

   o  Multiple Managers
        An organization may have multiple management stations for
        different units of the organization, for different functions
        (e.g. engineering and operations), and in an attempt to provide
        disaster recovery.  Because environments with multiple
        management stations are common, the remote network monitoring
        device has to deal with more than own management station,
        potentially using its resources concurrently.

   The objects are arranged into the following groups:

         - ethernet history

         - alarm

         - hostTopN

         - matrix

         - filter

         - packet capture

         - event

   These groups are the basic unit of conformance.  If a remote
   monitoring device implements a group, then it must implement all
   objects in that group.  For example, a managed agent that implements
   the host group must implement the hostControlTable, the hostTable and
   the hostTimeTable. While this section provides an overview of
   grouping and conformance information for this MIB, the authoritative
   reference for such information is contained in the MODULE-COMPLIANCE
   and OBJECT-GROUP macros later in this MIB.

   All groups in this MIB are optional.  Implementations of this MIB
   must also implement the system group of MIB-II [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets: MIB-II"'>16</a>] and the IF-MIB
   [<a href="#ref-17" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>17</a>].  MIB-II may also mandate the implementation of additional
   groups.

   These groups are defined to provide a means of assigning object
   identifiers, and to provide a method for implementors of managed
   agents to know which objects they must implement.

   The alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from variables
   in the probe and compares them to previously configured thresholds.
   If the monitored variable crosses a threshold, an event is generated.

   A hysteresis mechanism is implemented to limit the generation of
   alarms.  This group consists of the alarmTable and requires the
   implementation of the event group.

   The host group contains statistics associated with each host
   discovered on the network.  This group discovers hosts on the network
   by keeping a list of source and destination MAC Addresses seen in
   good packets promiscuously received from the network.  This group
   consists of the hostControlTable, the hostTable, and the
   hostTimeTable.

   The hostTopN group is used to prepare reports that describe the hosts
   that top a list ordered by one of their statistics.  The available
   statistics are samples of one of their base statistics over an
   interval specified by the management station.  Thus, these statistics
   are rate based.  The management station also selects how many such
   hosts are reported.  This group consists of the hostTopNControlTable
   and the hostTopNTable, and requires the implementation of the host
   group.

   a new entry in its tables.  This group consists of the
   matrixControlTable, the matrixSDTable and the matrixDSTable.

   Due to the complex nature of the available functions in these
   devices, the functions often need user configuration.  In many cases,
   the function requires parameters to be set up for a data collection
   operation.  The operation can proceed only after these parameters are
   fully set up.

   Many functional groups in this MIB have one or more tables in which
   to set up control parameters, and one or more data tables in which to
   place the results of the operation.  The control tables are typically
   read-write in nature, while the data tables are typically read-only.
   Because the parameters in the control table often describe resulting
   data in the data table, many of the parameters can be modified only
   when the control entry is invalid.  Thus, the method for modifying
   these parameters is to invalidate the control entry, causing its
   deletion and the deletion of any associated data entries, and then
   create a new control entry with the proper parameters.  Deleting the
   control entry also gives a convenient method for reclaiming the
   resources used by the associated data.

   Some objects in this MIB provide a mechanism to execute an action on
   the remote monitoring device.  These objects may execute an action as
   a result of a change in the state of the object.  For those objects
   in this MIB, a request to set an object to the same value as it
   currently holds would thus cause no action to occur.

   To facilitate control by multiple managers, resources have to be
   shared among the managers.  These resources are typically the memory
   and computation resources that a function requires.

   When multiple management stations wish to use functions that compete
   for a finite amount of resources on a device, a method to facilitate
   this sharing of resources is required.  Potential conflicts include:

      o  Two management stations wish to simultaneously use resources
         that together would exceed the capability of the device.
      o  A management station uses a significant amount of resources for
         a long period of time.
      o  A management station uses resources and then crashes,
         forgetting to free the resources so others may use them.

   A mechanism is provided for each management station initiated
   function in this MIB to avoid these conflicts and to help resolve
   them when they occur.  Each function has a label identifying the
   initiator (owner) of the function.  This label is set by the
   initiator to provide for the following possibilities:

      o  A management station may recognize resources it owns and no
         longer needs.
      o  A network operator can find the management station that owns
         the resource and negotiate for it to be freed.
      o  A network operator may decide to unilaterally free resources
         another network operator has reserved.
      o  Upon initialization, a management station may recognize
         resources it had reserved in the past.  With this information
         it may free the resources if it no longer needs them.

   Management stations and probes should support any format of the owner
   string dictated by the local policy of the organization.  It is
   suggested that this name contain one or more of the following: IP
   address, management station name, network manager's name, location,
   or phone number.  This information will help users to share the
   resources more effectively.

   There is often default functionality that the device or the
   administrator of the probe (often the network administrator) wishes
   to set up.  The resources associated with this functionality are then
   owned by the device itself or by the network administrator, and are
   intended to be long-lived.  In this case, the device or the
   administrator will set the relevant owner object to a string starting
   with 'monitor'.  Indiscriminate modification of the monitor-owned
   configuration by network management stations is discouraged.  In
   fact, a network management station should only modify these objects
   under the direction of the administrator of the probe.





<span class="grey">Waldbusser                  Standards Track                     [Page 9]</span></pre>

   Resources on a probe are scarce and are typically allocated when
   control rows are created by an application.  Since many applications
   may be using a probe simultaneously, indiscriminate allocation of
   resources to particular applications is very likely to cause resource
   shortages in the probe.

   When a network management station wishes to utilize a function in a
   monitor, it is encouraged to first scan the control table of that
   function to find an instance with similar parameters to share.  This
   is especially true for those instances owned by the monitor, which
   can be assumed to change infrequently.  If a management station
   decides to share an instance owned by another management station, it
   should understand that the management station that owns the instance
   may indiscriminately modify or delete it.

   It should be noted that a management application should have the most
   trust in a monitor-owned row because it should be changed very
   infrequently.  A row owned by the management application is less
   long-lived because a network administrator is more likely to re-
   assign resources from a row that is in use by one user than from a
   monitor-owned row that is potentially in use by many users.  A row
   owned by another application would be even less long-lived because
   the other application may delete or modify that row completely at its
   discretion.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Row%20Addition%20Among%20Multiple%20Management%20Stations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Row Addition Among Multiple Management Stations</span>

   The addition of new rows is achieved using the method described in
   <a href="rfc1905.html">RFC 1905</a> [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>13</a>].  In this MIB, rows are often added to a table in order
   to configure a function.  This configuration usually involves
   parameters that control the operation of the function.  The agent
   must check these parameters to make sure they are appropriate given
   restrictions defined in this MIB as well as any implementation
   specific restrictions such as lack of resources.  The agent
   implementor may be confused as to when to check these parameters and
   when to signal to the management station that the parameters are
   invalid.  There are two opportunities:

      o  When the management station sets each parameter object.

      o  When the management station sets the entry status object to
         valid.

   If the latter is chosen, it would be unclear to the management
   station which of the several parameters was invalid and caused the
   badValue error to be emitted.  Thus, wherever possible, the
   implementor should choose the former as it will provide more
   information to the management station.



<span class="grey">Waldbusser                  Standards Track                    [Page 10]</span></pre>

   A problem can arise when multiple management stations attempt to set
   configuration information simultaneously using SNMP.  When this
   involves the addition of a new conceptual row in the same control
   table, the managers may collide, attempting to create the same entry.
   To guard against these collisions, each such control entry contains a
   status object with special semantics that help to arbitrate among the
   managers.  If an attempt is made with the row addition mechanism to
   create such a status object and that object already exists, an error
   is returned.  When more than one manager simultaneously attempts to
   create the same conceptual row, only the first can succeed.  The
   others will receive an error.

   When a manager wishes to create a new control entry, it needs to
   choose an index for that row.  It may choose this index in a variety
   of ways, hopefully minimizing the chances that the index is in use by
   another manager.  If the index is in use, the mechanism mentioned
   previously will guard against collisions.  Examples of schemes to
   choose index values include random selection or scanning the control
   table looking for the first unused index.  Because index values may
   be any valid value in the range and they are chosen by the manager,
   the agent must allow a row to be created with any unused index value
   if it has the resources to create a new row.

   Some tables in this MIB reference other tables within this MIB.  When
   creating or deleting entries in these tables, it is generally
   allowable for dangling references to exist.  There is no defined
   order for creating or deleting entries in these tables.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Conventions</span>

   The following conventions are used throughout the RMON MIB and its
   companion documents.

   Good Packets

   Good packets are error-free packets that have a valid frame length.
   For example, on Ethernet, good packets are error-free packets that
   are between 64 octets long and 1518 octets long.  They follow the
   form defined in IEEE 802.3 <a href="#section-3.2">section 3.2</a>.all.

   Bad Packets

   Bad packets are packets that have proper framing and are therefore
   recognized as packets, but contain errors within the packet or have
   an invalid length.  For example, on Ethernet, bad packets have a
   valid preamble and SFD, but have a bad CRC, or are either shorter
   than 64 octets or longer than 1518 octets.

     DESCRIPTION
         "Remote network monitoring devices, often called
         monitors or probes, are instruments that exist for
         the purpose of managing a network. This MIB defines
         objects for managing remote network monitoring devices."

     DESCRIPTION
         "Bug fixes, clarifications and minor changes based on
         implementation experience, published as <a href="rfc1757.html">RFC1757</a> [<a href="#ref-18" title='"Remote Network Monitoring MIB"'>18</a>].

         Two changes were made to object definitions:

         1) A new status bit has been defined for the
         captureBufferPacketStatus object, indicating that the
         packet order within the capture buffer may not be identical to
         the packet order as received off the wire.  This bit may only

         be used for packets transmitted by the probe.  Older NMS
         applications can safely ignore this status bit, which might be
         used by newer agents.

         2) The packetMatch trap has been removed.  This trap was never
         actually 'approved' and was not added to this document along
         with the risingAlarm and fallingAlarm traps. The packetMatch
         trap could not be throttled, which could cause disruption of
         normal network traffic under some circumstances. An NMS should
         configure a risingAlarm threshold on the appropriate
         channelMatches instance if a trap is desired for a packetMatch
         event. Note that logging of packetMatch events is still
         supported--only trap generation for such events has been
         removed.

         In addition, several clarifications to individual object
         definitions have been added to assist agent and NMS
         implementors:

         - global definition of 'good packets' and 'bad packets'

         - more detailed text governing conceptual row creation and
           modification

         - instructions for probes relating to interface changes and
           disruptions

         - clarification of some ethernet counter definitions

         - recommended formula for calculating network utilization

         - clarification of channel and captureBuffer behavior for some
           unusual conditions

         - examples of proper instance naming for each table"

     DESCRIPTION
         "This data type is used to model an administratively
         assigned name of the owner of a resource. Implementations
         must accept values composed of well-formed NVT ASCII
         sequences. In addition, implementations should accept
         values composed of well-formed UTF-8 sequences.

         It is suggested that this name contain one or more of
         the following: IP address, management station name,
         network manager's name, location, or phone number.
         In some cases the agent itself will be the owner of
         an entry.  In these cases, this string shall be set
         to a string starting with 'monitor'.

         SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms
         of the contents of MIB views; access to a particular
         SNMP object instance depends only upon its presence
         or absence in a particular MIB view and never upon
         its value or the value of related object instances.
         Thus, objects of this type afford resolution of
         resource contention only among cooperating
         managers; they realize no access control function
         with respect to uncooperative parties."

 EntryStatus ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     STATUS current
     DESCRIPTION
         "The status of a table entry.

         Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the
         effect of invalidating the corresponding entry.
         That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping
         identified with said entry.
         It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether
         the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
         Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to
         receive tabular information from agents that corresponds
         to entries currently not in use.  Proper
         interpretation of such entries requires examination
         of the relevant EntryStatus object.

         An existing instance of this object cannot be set to
         createRequest(2).  This object may only be set to
         createRequest(2) when this instance is created.  When
         this object is created, the agent may wish to create
         supplemental object instances with default values
         to complete a conceptual row in this table.  Because the

         creation of these default objects is entirely at the option
         of the agent, the manager must not assume that any will be
         created, but may make use of any that are created.
         Immediately after completing the create operation, the agent
         must set this object to underCreation(3).

         When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is allowed to
         exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly inconsistent state,
         usually to allow it to be modified in multiple PDUs.  When in
         this state, an entry is not fully active.
         Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until
         the management station is finished configuring the entry
         and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this
         object to invalid(4).  If the agent determines that an
         entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for an
         abnormally long time, it may decide that the management
         station has crashed.  If the agent makes this decision,
         it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the
         entry.  A prudent agent will understand that the
         management station may need to wait for human input
         and will allow for that possibility in its
         determination of this abnormally long period.

         An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and
         consistent and fully represents the configuration or
         operation such a row is intended to represent.  For
         example, it could be a statistical function that is
         configured and active, or a filter that is available
         in the list of filters processed by the packet capture
         process.

         A manager is restricted to changing the state of an entry in
         the following ways:

              To:       valid  createRequest  underCreation  invalid
         From:
         valid             OK             NO             OK       OK
         createRequest    N/A            N/A            N/A      N/A
         underCreation     OK             NO             OK       OK
         invalid           NO             NO             NO       OK
         nonExistent       NO             OK             NO       OK

         In the table above, it is not applicable to move the state
         from the createRequest state to any other state because the
         manager will never find the variable in that state.  The
         nonExistent state is not a value of the enumeration, rather
         it means that the entryStatus variable does not exist at all.

         An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change state in
         additional ways, so long as the semantics of the states are
         followed.  This allowance is made to ease the implementation of
         the agent and is made despite the fact that managers should
         never exercise these additional state transitions."

         In order to identify a particular interface, this object

         defined in <a href="rfc2233.html">RFC 2233</a> [<a href="#ref-17" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>17</a>], for the desired interface.
         For example, if an entry were to receive data from
         interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1.

         The statistics in this group reflect all packets
         on the local network segment attached to the identified
         interface.

         An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental
         changes to the media of the interface have occurred and

         stations are transmitting simultaneously.  Thus a probe
         placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
         than a probe connected to a station on the same segment
         would.

         Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering
         10BASE-T.  14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3
         defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals
         on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
         at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
         collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
         a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
         collisions.

         Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
         ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
         more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
         802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax
         segments to which the repeater is connected."

 -- The History Control Group

 -- Implementation of the History Control group is optional.
 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative

 --
 -- The history control group controls the periodic statistical
 -- sampling of data from various types of networks.  The
 -- historyControlTable stores configuration entries that each
 -- define an interface, polling period, and other parameters.
 -- Once samples are taken, their data is stored in an entry
 -- in a media-specific table.  Each such entry defines one
 -- sample, and is associated with the historyControlEntry that
 -- caused the sample to be taken.  Each counter in the
 -- etherHistoryEntry counts the same event as its similarly-named
 -- counterpart in the etherStatsEntry, except that each value here
 -- is a cumulative sum during a sampling period.
 --
 -- If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start
 -- the first sample of the history at a time such that
 -- when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is
 -- started at that instant.  This tends to make more
 -- user-friendly reports, and enables comparison of reports
 -- from different probes that have relatively accurate time
 -- of day.
 --
 -- The probe is encouraged to add two history control entries
 -- per monitored interface upon initialization that describe a short
 -- term and a long term polling period.  Suggested parameters are 30
 -- seconds for the short term polling period and 30 minutes for
 -- the long term period.

         placed on a repeater port could record more collisions
         than a probe connected to a station on the same segment

         Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering

         on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving
         at the same time).  A 10BASE-T station can only detect
         collisions when it is transmitting.  Thus probes placed on
         a station and a repeater, should report the same number of
         collisions.

         Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should
         ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or
         more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE
         802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax

 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative

 --
 -- The Alarm group periodically takes statistical samples from
 -- variables in the probe and compares them to thresholds that have
 -- been configured.  The alarm table stores configuration
 -- entries that each define a variable, polling period, and
 -- threshold parameters.  If a sample is found to cross the
 -- threshold values, an event is generated.  Only variables that
 -- resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32,
 -- Counter32, Counter64, Gauge32, or TimeTicks) may be monitored in
 -- this way.

 -- This function has a hysteresis mechanism to limit the generation

 -- is crossed in the appropriate direction.  No more events are
 -- generated for that threshold until the opposite threshold is
 -- crossed.
 --
 -- In the case of a sampling a deltaValue, a probe may implement
 -- this mechanism with more precision if it takes a delta sample
 -- twice per period, each time comparing the sum of the latest two
 -- samples to the threshold.  This allows the detection of threshold

 -- keeps a set of statistics.  The hostControlTable controls
 -- which interfaces this function is performed on, and contains
 -- some information about the process.  On behalf of each
 -- hostControlEntry, data is collected on an interface and placed
 -- in both the hostTable and the hostTimeTable.  If the
 -- monitoring device finds itself short of resources, it may
 -- delete entries as needed.  It is suggested that the device
 -- delete the least recently used entries first.

 -- The hostTable contains entries for each address discovered on
 -- a particular interface.  Each entry contains statistical
 -- data about that host.  This table is indexed by the
 -- MAC address of the host, through which a random access
 -- may be achieved.

 -- The hostTimeTable contains data in the same format as the
 -- hostTable, and must contain the same set of hosts, but is
 -- indexed using hostTimeCreationOrder rather than hostAddress.
 -- The hostTimeCreationOrder is an integer which reflects
 -- the relative order in which a particular entry was discovered
 -- and thus inserted into the table.  As this order, and thus
 -- the index, is among those entries currently in the table,
 -- the index for a particular entry may change if an
 -- (earlier) entry is deleted.  Thus the association between
 -- hostTimeCreationOrder and hostTimeEntry may be broken at
 -- any time.

 -- The hostTimeTable has two important uses.  The first is the
 -- fast download of this potentially large table.  Because the
 -- index of this table runs from 1 to the size of the table,
 -- inclusive, its values are predictable.  This allows very
 -- efficient packing of variables into SNMP PDU's and allows
 -- a table transfer to have multiple packets outstanding.
 -- These benefits increase transfer rates tremendously.

 -- The second use of the hostTimeTable is the efficient discovery
 -- by the management station of new entries added to the table.
 -- After the management station has downloaded the entire table,
 -- it knows that new entries will be added immediately after the
 -- end of the current table.  It can thus detect new entries there
 -- and retrieve them easily.

 -- Because the association between hostTimeCreationOrder and
 -- hostTimeEntry may be broken at any time, the management
 -- station must monitor the related hostControlLastDeleteTime
 -- object.  When the management station thus detects a deletion,
 -- it must assume that any such associations have been broken,
 -- and invalidate any it has stored locally.  This includes

 -- restarting any download of the hostTimeTable that may have been
 -- in progress, as well as rediscovering the end of the

 -- particular conversation between two addresses.  As the device
 -- detects a new conversation, including those to a non-unicast
 -- address, it creates a new entry in both of the matrix tables.
 -- It must only create new entries based on information
 -- received in good packets.  If the monitoring device finds
 -- itself short of resources, it may delete entries as needed.
 -- It is suggested that the device delete the least recently used
 -- entries first.

 -- Consult the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro for the authoritative
 -- conformance information for this MIB.
 --
 -- The Filter group allows packets to be captured with an
 -- arbitrary filter expression.  A logical data and
 -- event stream or "channel" is formed by the packets
 -- that match the filter expression.
 --
 -- This filter mechanism allows the creation of an arbitrary
 -- logical expression with which to filter packets.  Each
 -- filter associated with a channel is OR'ed with the others.
 -- Within a filter, any bits checked in the data and status are
 -- AND'ed with respect to other bits in the same filter.  The
 -- NotMask also allows for checking for inequality.  Finally,
 -- the channelAcceptType object allows for inversion of the
 -- whole equation.
 --
 -- If a management station wishes to receive a trap to alert it
 -- that new packets have been captured and are available for
 -- download, it is recommended that it set up an alarm entry that
 -- monitors the value of the relevant channelMatches instance.
 --
 -- The channel can be turned on or off, and can also
 -- generate events when packets pass through it.

         The following two rules are then applied to every packet:

             the bit from the packet status is not equal to the

             corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the
             packet will fail this status match.

         (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the
             corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the
             bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding
             bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail
             this status match.

         Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches
         above have passed this status match.  In particular, a zero
         length status filter will match any packet's status.

         The value of the packet status is a sum.  This sum
         initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
         error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
         2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.
         The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent
         on the media type of the interface that this channel
         is receiving packets from.

         The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
         Ethernet interface are as follows:

             bit #    Error
                 0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
                 1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
                 2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error

         For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
         value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).

         As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object
         will have other media-specific errors defined.

         For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the
         packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object,
         this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it
         reaches the size of the packet status.

         This object may not be modified if the associated
         filterStatus object is equal to valid(1)."

 --
 -- The Event group controls the generation and notification
 -- of events from this device.  Each entry in the eventTable
 -- describes the parameters of the event that can be triggered.
 -- Each event entry is fired by an associated condition located
 -- elsewhere in the MIB.  An event entry may also be associated
 -- with a function elsewhere in the MIB that will be executed
 -- when the event is generated.  For example, a channel may
 -- be turned on or off by the firing of an event.
 --
 -- Each eventEntry may optionally specify that a log entry
 -- be created on its behalf whenever the event occurs.
 -- Each entry may also specify that notification should
 -- occur by way of SNMP trap messages.  In this case, the
 -- community for the trap message is given in the associated
 -- eventCommunity object.  The enterprise and specific trap
 -- fields of the trap are determined by the condition that
 -- triggered the event.  Two traps are defined: risingAlarm and

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   In order to implement this MIB, a probe must capture all packets on
   the locally-attached network, including packets between third
   parties.  These packets are analyzed to collect network addresses,
   protocol usage information, and conversation statistics. Data of this
   nature may be considered sensitive in some environments. In such
   environments the administrator may wish to restrict SNMP access to
   the probe.

   This MIB also includes functions for returning the contents of
   captured packets, potentially including sensitive user data or
   passwords. It is recommended that SNMP access to these functions be
   restricted.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model <a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>12</a>] and the View-based
   Access Control Model <a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="#ref-15" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>15</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
