          1.  Introduction
   
          A network management system contains: several (potentially
          many) nodes, each with a processing entity, termed an agent,
          which has access to management instrumentation; at least one
          management station; and, a management protocol, used to convey
          management information between the agents and management
          stations.  Operations of the protocol are carried out under an
          administrative framework which defines both authentication and
          authorization policies.
   
          Network management stations execute management applications
          which monitor and control network elements.  Network elements
          are devices such as hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc.,
          which are monitored and controlled through access to their
          management information.
   
          Management information is viewed as a collection of managed
          objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the
          Management Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related
          objects are defined in MIB modules.  These modules are written
          using a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
          [<a href="#ref-1" title="(December">1</a>], termed the Structure of Management Information (SMI) [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure of Management Information for version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>].
   
          When designing a MIB module, it is often useful to new define
          types similar to those defined in the SMI.  In comparison to a
          type defined in the SMI, each of these new types has a
          different name, a similar syntax, but a more precise
          semantics.  These newly defined types are termed textual
          conventions, and are used for the convenience of humans
          reading the MIB module.  It is the purpose of this document to
          define the initial set of textual conventions available to all
          MIB modules.
   
          Objects defined using a textual convention are always encoded
          by means of the rules that define their primitive type.
          However, textual conventions often have special semantics
          associated with them.  As such, an ASN.1 macro, TEXTUAL-
          CONVENTION, is used to concisely convey the syntax and
          semantics of a textual convention.
   
          For all textual conventions defined in an information module,
          the name shall be unique and mnemonic, and shall not exceed 64
          characters in length.  All names used for the textual
          conventions defined in all "standard" information modules

          1.1.  A Note on Terminology
   
          For the purpose of exposition, the original Internet-standard
          Network Management Framework, as described in RFCs 1155, 1157,
          and 1212, is termed the SNMP version 1 framework (SNMPv1).
          The current framework is termed the SNMP version 2 framework
          (SNMPv2).

                      "The RowStatus textual convention is used to
                      manage the creation and deletion of conceptual
                      rows, and is used as the value of the SYNTAX
                      clause for the status column of a conceptual row
                      (as described in Section 7.7.1 of [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure of Management Information for version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>].)
   
                      The status column has six defined values:
   
                           - 'active', which indicates that the
                           conceptual row is available for use by the
                           managed device;
   
                           - 'notInService', which indicates that the
                           conceptual row exists in the agent, but is
                           unavailable for use by the managed device
                           (see NOTE below);
   
                           - 'notReady', which indicates that the
                           conceptual row exists in the agent, but is
                           missing information necessary in order to be
                           available for use by the managed device;
   
                           - 'createAndGo', which is supplied by a
                           management station wishing to create a new
                           instance of a conceptual row and to have it
                           available for use by the managed device;
   
                           - 'createAndWait', which is supplied by a
                           management station wishing to create a new
                           instance of a conceptual row but not to have
                           it available for use by the managed device;

                           the instances associated with an existing
                           conceptual row.
   
                      Whereas five of the six values (all except
                      'notReady') may be specified in a management
                      protocol set operation, only three values will be
                      returned in response to a management protocol

                      retrieval operation: 'notReady', 'notInService' or
                      'active'.  That is, when queried, an existing

                      available for use by the managed device (the
                      status column has value 'active'); it is not
                      available for use by the managed device, though
                      the agent has sufficient information to make it so
                      (the status column has value 'notInService'); or,
                      it is not available for use by the managed device,
                      because the agent lacks sufficient information
                      (the status column has value 'notReady').

                           This textual convention may be used for a MIB

                           that table's conceptual rows are able to be
                           modified while it is active, or whether its
                           conceptual rows must be taken out of service
                           in order to be modified.  That is, it is the
                           responsibility of the DESCRIPTION clause of
                           the status column to specify whether the
                           status column must be 'notInService' in order
                           for the value of some other column of the

                      (2) if other variable bindings included in the
                      same PDU, provide values for all columns which are
                      missing but required, then return noError and goto
                      D.
   
                      (3) if other variable bindings included in the
                      same PDU, provide values for all columns which are
                      missing but required, then return noError and goto
                      C.
   
                      (4) at the discretion of the agent, either noError
                      or inconsistentValue may be returned.
   
                      NOTE: Other processing of the set request may
                      result in a response other than noError being
                      returned, e.g., wrongValue, noCreation, etc.
   
   
                                   Conceptual Row Creation
   
                      There are four potential interactions when
                      creating a conceptual row: selecting an instance-
                      identifier which is not in use; creating the
                      conceptual row; initializing any objects for which
                      the agent does not supply a default; and, making
                      the conceptual row available for use by the
                      managed device.
   
                      Interaction 1: Selecting an Instance-Identifier
   
                      The algorithm used to select an instance-
                      identifier varies for each conceptual row.  In
                      some cases, the instance-identifier is
                      semantically significant, e.g., the destination
                      address of a route, and a management station
                      selects the instance-identifier according to the
                      semantics.
   
                      In other cases, the instance-identifier is used
                      solely to distinguish conceptual rows, and a
                      management station without specific knowledge of
                      the conceptual row might examine the instances

                      present in order to determine an unused instance-
                      identifier.  (This approach may be used, but it is
                      often highly sub-optimal; however, it is also a
                      questionable practice for a naive management
                      station to attempt conceptual row creation.)
   
                      Alternately, the MIB module which defines the
                      conceptual row might provide one or more objects
                      which provide assistance in determining an unused
                      instance-identifier.  For example, if the
                      conceptual row is indexed by an integer-value,
                      then an object having an integer-valued SYNTAX
                      clause might be defined for such a purpose,
                      allowing a management station to issue a
                      management protocol retrieval operation.  In order
                      to avoid unnecessary collisions between competing
                      management stations, 'adjacent' retrievals of this
                      object should be different.
   
                      Finally, the management station could select a
                      pseudo-random number to use as the index.  In the
                      event that this index was already in use and an
                      inconsistentValue was returned in response to the
                      management protocol set operation, the management
                      station should simply select a new pseudo-random
                      number and retry the operation.
   
                      A MIB designer should choose between the two
                      latter algorithms based on the size of the table
                      (and therefore the efficiency of each algorithm).
                      For tables in which a large number of entries are
                      expected, it is recommended that a MIB object be
                      defined that returns an acceptable index for
                      creation.  For tables with small numbers of
                      entries, it is recommended that the latter
                      pseudo-random index mechanism be used.
   
                      Interaction 2: Creating the Conceptual Row
   
                      Once an unused instance-identifier has been
                      selected, the management station determines if it
                      wishes to create and activate the conceptual row
                      in one transaction or in a negotiated set of
                      interactions.

                      Interaction 2a: Creating and Activating the
                      Conceptual Row
   
                      The management station must first determine the
                      column requirements, i.e., it must determine those
                      columns for which it must or must not provide
                      values.  Depending on the complexity of the table
                      and the management station's knowledge of the
                      agent's capabilities, this determination can be
                      made locally by the management station.
                      Alternately, the management station issues a
                      management protocol get operation to examine all
                      columns in the conceptual row that it wishes to
                      create.  In response, for each column, there are
                      three possible outcomes:
   
                           - a value is returned, indicating that some
                           other management station has already created
                           this conceptual row.  We return to
                           interaction 1.
   
                           - the exception 'noSuchInstance' is returned,
                           indicating that the agent implements the
                           object-type associated with this column, and
                           that this column in at least one conceptual
                           row would be accessible in the MIB view used
                           by the retrieval were it to exist. For those
                           columns to which the agent provides read-
                           create access, the 'noSuchInstance' exception
                           tells the management station that it should
                           supply a value for this column when the
                           conceptual row is to be created.
   
                           - the exception 'noSuchObject' is returned,
                           indicating that the agent does not implement
                           the object-type associated with this column
                           or that there is no conceptual row for which
                           this column would be accessible in the MIB
                           view used by the retrieval.  As such, the
                           management station can not issue any
                           management protocol set operations to create
                           an instance of this column.
   
                      Once the column requirements have been determined,
                      a management protocol set operation is accordingly

                      issued.  This operation also sets the new instance
                      of the status column to 'createAndGo'.
   
                      When the agent processes the set operation, it
                      verifies that it has sufficient information to
                      make the conceptual row available for use by the
                      managed device.  The information available to the
                      agent is provided by two sources: the management
                      protocol set operation which creates the
                      conceptual row, and, implementation-specific
                      defaults supplied by the agent (note that an agent
                      must provide implementation-specific defaults for
                      at least those objects which it implements as
                      read-only).  If there is sufficient information
                      available, then the conceptual row is created, a
                      'noError' response is returned, the status column
                      is set to 'active', and no further interactions
                      are necessary (i.e., interactions 3 and 4 are
                      skipped).  If there is insufficient information,
                      then the conceptual row is not created, and the
                      set operation fails with an error of
                      'inconsistentValue'.  On this error, the
                      management station can issue a management protocol
                      retrieval operation to determine if this was
                      because it failed to specify a value for a
                      required column, or, because the selected instance
                      of the status column already existed.  In the
                      latter case, we return to interaction 1.  In the
                      former case, the management station can re-issue
                      the set operation with the additional information,
                      or begin interaction 2 again using 'createAndWait'
                      in order to negotiate creation of the conceptual
                      row.

                                          NOTE WELL
   
                           Regardless of the method used to determine
                           the column requirements, it is possible that
                           the management station might deem a column
                           necessary when, in fact, the agent will not
                           allow that particular columnar instance to be
                           created or written.  In this case, the
                           management protocol set operation will fail
                           with an error such as 'noCreation' or
                           'notWritable'.  In this case, the management
                           station decides whether it needs to be able
                           to set a value for that particular columnar
                           instance.  If not, the management station
                           re-issues the management protocol set
                           operation, but without setting a value for
                           that particular columnar instance; otherwise,
                           the management station aborts the row
                           creation algorithm.
   
                      Interaction 2b: Negotiating the Creation of the
                      Conceptual Row
   
                      The management station issues a management
                      protocol set operation which sets the desired
                      instance of the status column to 'createAndWait'.
                      If the agent is unwilling to process a request of
                      this sort, the set operation fails with an error
                      of 'wrongValue'.  (As a consequence, such an agent
                      must be prepared to accept a single management
                      protocol set operation, i.e., interaction 2a
                      above, containing all of the columns indicated by
                      its column requirements.) Otherwise, the
                      conceptual row is created, a 'noError' response is
                      returned, and the status column is immediately set
                      to either 'notInService' or 'notReady', depending
                      on whether it has sufficient information to make
                      the conceptual row available for use by the
                      managed device.  If there is sufficient
                      information available, then the status column is
                      set to 'notInService'; otherwise, if there is
                      insufficient information, then the status column
                      is set to 'notReady'.  Regardless, we proceed to
                      interaction 3.

                      Interaction 3: Initializing non-defaulted Objects
   
                      The management station must now determine the
                      column requirements.  It issues a management
                      protocol get operation to examine all columns in
                      the created conceptual row.  In the response, for
                      each column, there are three possible outcomes:
   
                           - a value is returned, indicating that the
                           agent implements the object-type associated
                           with this column and had sufficient
                           information to provide a value.  For those
                           columns to which the agent provides read-
                           create access, a value return tells the
                           management station that it may issue
                           additional management protocol set
                           operations, if it desires, in order to change
                           the value associated with this column.
   
                           - the exception 'noSuchInstance' is returned,
                           indicating that the agent implements the
                           object-type associated with this column, and
                           that this column in at least one conceptual
                           row would be accessible in the MIB view used
                           by the retrieval were it to exist. However,
                           the agent does not have sufficient
                           information to provide a value, and until a
                           value is provided, the conceptual row may not
                           be made available for use by the managed
                           device.  For those columns to which the agent
                           provides read-create access, the
                           'noSuchInstance' exception tells the
                           management station that it must issue
                           additional management protocol set
                           operations, in order to provide a value
                           associated with this column.
   
                           - the exception 'noSuchObject' is returned,
                           indicating that the agent does not implement
                           the object-type associated with this column
                           or that there is no conceptual row for which
                           this column would be accessible in the MIB
                           view used by the retrieval.  As such, the
                           management station can not issue any
                           management protocol set operations to create

                           an instance of this column.
   
                      If the value associated with the status column is
                      'notReady', then the management station must first
                      deal with all 'noSuchInstance' columns, if any.
                      Having done so, the value of the status column
                      becomes 'notInService', and we proceed to
                      interaction 4.
   
                      Interaction 4: Making the Conceptual Row Available
   
                      Once the management station is satisfied with the
                      values associated with the columns of the
                      conceptual row, it issues a management protocol
                      set operation to set the status column to
                      'active'.  If the agent has sufficient information
                      to make the conceptual row available for use by
                      the managed device, the management protocol set
                      operation succeeds (a 'noError' response is
                      returned).  Otherwise, the management protocol set
                      operation fails with an error of
                      'inconsistentValue'.
   
                                          NOTE WELL
   
                           A conceptual row having a status column with
                           value 'notInService' or 'notReady' is
                           unavailable to the managed device.  As such,
                           it is possible for the managed device to
                           create its own instances during the time
                           between the management protocol set operation
                           which sets the status column to
                           'createAndWait' and the management protocol
                           set operation which sets the status column to
                           'active'.  In this case, when the management
                           protocol set operation is issued to set the
                           status column to 'active', the values held in
                           the agent supersede those used by the managed
                           device.
   
                      If the management station is prevented from
                      setting the status column to 'active' (e.g., due
                      to management station or network failure) the
                      conceptual row will be left in the 'notInService'
                      or 'notReady' state, consuming resources

                      indefinitely.  The agent must detect conceptual
                      rows that have been in either state for an
                      abnormally long period of time and remove them.
                      This period of time should be long enough to allow
                      for human response time (including 'think time')
                      between the creation of the conceptual row and the
                      setting of the status to 'active'.  It is
                      suggested that this period be approximately 5
                      minutes in length.
   
   
                                  Conceptual Row Suspension
   
                      When a conceptual row is 'active', the management
                      station may issue a management protocol set
                      operation which sets the instance of the status
                      column to 'notInService'.  If the agent is
                      unwilling to do so, the set operation fails with
                      an error of 'wrongValue'.  Otherwise, the
                      conceptual row is taken out of service, and a
                      'noError' response is returned.  It is the
                      responsibility of the the DESCRIPTION clause of
                      the status column to indicate under what
                      circumstances the status column should be taken
                      out of service (e.g., in order for the value of
                      some other column of the same conceptual row to be
                      modified).
   
   
                                   Conceptual Row Deletion
   
                      For deletion of conceptual rows, a management
                      protocol set operation is issued which sets the
                      instance of the status column to 'destroy'.  This
                      request may be made regardless of the current
                      value of the status column (e.g., it is possible
                      to delete conceptual rows which are either
                      'notReady', 'notInService' or 'active'.) If the
                      operation succeeds, then all instances associated
                      with the conceptual row are immediately removed."

          3.  Mapping of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro
   
          The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro is used to convey the syntax and
          semantics associated with a textual convention.  It should be
          noted that the expansion of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro is
          something which conceptually happens during implementation and
          not during run-time.
   
          For all descriptors appearing in an information module, the
          descriptor shall be unique and mnemonic, and shall not exceed
          64 characters in length.  Further, the hyphen is not allowed
          as a character in the name of any textual convention.
   
   
          3.1.  Mapping of the DISPLAY-HINT clause
   
          The DISPLAY-HINT clause, which need not be present, gives a
          hint as to how the value of an instance of an object with the
          syntax defined using this textual convention might be
          displayed.  The DISPLAY-HINT clause may only be present when
          the syntax has an underlying primitive type of INTEGER or
          OCTET STRING.
   
          When the syntax has an underlying primitive type of INTEGER,
          the hint consists of a single character suggesting a display
          format, either: 'x' for hexadecimal, 'd' for decimal, or 'o'
          for octal, or 'b' for binary.
   
          When the syntax has an underlying primitive type of OCTET
          STRING, the hint consists of one or more octet-format
          specifications.  Each specification consists of five parts,
          with each part using and removing zero or more of the next
          octets from the value and producing the next zero or more
          characters to be displayed.  The octets within the value are
          processed in order of significance, most significant first.
   
          The five parts of a octet-format specification are:
   
          (1)  the (optional) repeat indicator; if present, this part is
               a '*', and indicates that the current octet of the value
               is to be used as the repeat count.  The repeat count is
               an unsigned integer (which may be zero) which specifies
               how many times the remainder of this octet-format
               specification should be successively applied.  If the
               repeat indicator is not present, the repeat count is one.

          (2)  the octet length: one or more decimal digits specifying
               the number of octets of the value to be used and
               formatted by this octet-specification.  Note that the
               octet length can be zero.  If less than this number of
               octets remain in the value, then the lesser number of
               octets are used.
   
          (3)  the display format, either: 'x' for hexadecimal, 'd' for
               decimal, 'o' for octal, or 'a' for ascii.  If the octet
               length part is greater than one, and the display format
               part refers to a numeric format, then network-byte
               ordering (big-endian encoding) is used interpreting the
               octets in the value.
   
          (4)  the (optional) display separator character; if present,
               this part is a single character which is produced for
               display after each application of this octet-
               specification; however, this character is not produced
               for display if it would be immediately followed by the
               display of the repeat terminator character for this
               octet-specification.  This character can be any character
               other than a decimal digit and a '*'.
   
          (5)  the (optional) repeat terminator character, which can be
               present only if the display separator character is
               present and this octet-specification begins with a repeat
               indicator; if present, this part is a single character
               which is produced after all the zero or more repeated
               applications (as given by the repeat count) of this
               octet-specification.  This character can be any character
               other than a decimal digit and a '*'.
   
          Output of a display separator character or a repeat terminator
          character is suppressed if it would occur as the last
          character of the display.
   
          If the octets of the value are exhausted before all the
          octet-format specification have been used, then the excess
          specifications are ignored.  If additional octets remain in
          the value after interpreting all the octet-format
          specifications, then the last octet-format specification is
          re-interpreted to process the additional octets, until no
          octets remain in the value.

   <span class="grey">       <a href="rfc1443.html">RFC 1443</a>        Textual Conventions for SNMPv2      April 1993</span>
   
   
          3.2.  Mapping of the STATUS clause
   
          The STATUS clause, which must be present, indicates whether
          this definition is current or historic.
   
          The values "current", and "obsolete" are self-explanatory.
          The "deprecated" value indicates that the textual convention
          is obsolete, but that an implementor may wish to support that
          object to foster interoperability with older implementations.
   
   
          3.3.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION clause
   
          The DESCRIPTION clause, which must be present, contains a
          textual definition of the textual convention, which provides
          all semantic definitions necessary for implementation, and
          should embody any information which would otherwise be
          communicated in any ASN.1 commentary annotations associated
          with the object.
   
          Note that, in order to conform to the ASN.1 syntax, the entire
          value of this clause must be enclosed in double quotation
          marks, and therefore cannot itself contain double quotation
          marks, although the value may be multi-line.
   
   
          3.4.  Mapping of the REFERENCE clause
   
          The REFERENCE clause, which need not be present, contains a
          textual cross-reference to a related item defined in some
          other published work.
   
   
          3.5.  Mapping of the SYNTAX clause
   
          The SYNTAX clause, which must be present, defines abstract
          data structure corresponding to the textual convention.  The
          data structure must be one of the alternatives defined in the
          ObjectSyntax CHOICE [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure of Management Information for version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>2</a>].
   
          Full ASN.1 sub-typing is allowed, as appropriate to the
          underingly ASN.1 type, primarily as an aid to implementors in
          understanding the meaning of the textual convention.  Of
          course, sub-typing is not allowed for textual conventions
          derived from either the Counter32 or Counter64 types, but is
