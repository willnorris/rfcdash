   The Architecture for describing Internet Management Frameworks
   [<a href="rfc2271.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2271</a>] describes that an SNMP engine is composed of:

     1) a Dispatcher
     2) a Message Processing Subsystem,
     3) a Security Subsystem, and
     4) an Access Control Subsystem.

   Applications make use of the services of these subsystems.

   It is important to understand the SNMP architecture and the
   terminology of the architecture to understand where the Security
   Model described in this document fits into the architecture and

   interacts with other subsystems within the architecture.  The reader
   is expected to have read and understood the description of the SNMP
   architecture, as defined in [<a href="rfc2271.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2271</a>].

   This memo [<a href="rfc2274.html">RFC2274</a>] describes the User-based Security Model as it is
   used within the SNMP Architecture.  The main idea is that we use the
   traditional concept of a user (identified by a userName) with which
   to associate security information.

   This memo describes the use of HMAC-MD5-96 and HMAC-SHA-96 as the
   authentication protocols and the use of CBC-DES as the privacy
   protocol. The User-based Security Model however allows for other such
   protocols to be used instead of or concurrent with these protocols.
   Therefore, the description of HMAC-MD5-96, HMAC-SHA-96 and CBC-DES
   are in separate sections to reflect their self-contained nature and
   to indicate that they can be replaced or supplemented in the future.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Threats"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Threats</span>

   Several of the classical threats to network protocols are applicable
   to the network management problem and therefore would be applicable
   to any SNMP Security Model.  Other threats are not applicable to the
   network management problem.  This section discusses principal
   threats, secondary threats, and threats which are of lesser
   importance.

   The principal threats against which this SNMP Security Model should
   provide protection are:

   - Modification of Information
     The modification threat is the danger that some unauthorized entity
     may alter in-transit SNMP messages generated on behalf of an
     authorized user in such a way as to effect unauthorized management
     operations, including falsifying the value of an object.

   - Masquerade
     The masquerade threat is the danger that management operations not
     authorized for some user may be attempted by assuming the identity
     of another user that has the appropriate authorizations.

   Two secondary threats are also identified.  The Security Model
   defined in this memo provides limited protection against:





<span class="grey">Blumenthal &amp; Wijnen         Standards Track                     [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-5" id="page-5" name="page-5"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2274.html">RFC 2274</a>                     USM for SNMPv3                 January 1998</span>


   - Disclosure
     The disclosure threat is the danger of eavesdropping on the
     exchanges between managed agents and a management station.
     Protecting against this threat may be required as a matter of local
     policy.

   - Message Stream Modification
     The SNMP protocol is typically based upon a connection-less
     transport service which may operate over any sub-network service.
     The re-ordering, delay or replay of messages can and does occur
     through the natural operation of many such sub-network services.
     The message stream modification threat is the danger that messages
     may be maliciously re-ordered, delayed or replayed to an extent
     which is greater than can occur through the natural operation of a
     sub-network service, in order to effect unauthorized management
     operations.

   There are at least two threats that an SNMP Security Model need not
   protect against.  The security protocols defined in this memo do not
   provide protection against:

   - Denial of Service
     This SNMP Security Model does not attempt to address the broad
     range of attacks by which service on behalf of authorized users is
     denied.  Indeed, such denial-of-service attacks are in many cases
     indistinguishable from the type of network failures with which any
     viable network management protocol must cope as a matter of course.
   - Traffic Analysis
     This SNMP Security Model does not attempt to address traffic
     analysis attacks.  Indeed, many traffic patterns are predictable -
     devices may be managed on a regular basis by a relatively small
     number of management applications - and therefore there is no
     significant advantage afforded by protecting against traffic
     analysis.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.%20%20Goals%20and%20Constraints"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Goals and Constraints</span>

   Based on the foregoing account of threats in the SNMP network
   management environment, the goals of this SNMP Security Model are as
   follows.

   1) Provide for verification that each received SNMP message has
      not been modified during its transmission through the network.

   2) Provide for verification of the identity of the user on whose
      behalf a received SNMP message claims to have been generated.





<span class="grey">Blumenthal &amp; Wijnen         Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>

   3) Provide for detection of received SNMP messages, which request
      or contain management information, whose time of generation was
      not recent.

   4) Provide, when necessary, that the contents of each received
      SNMP message are protected from disclosure.

   In addition to the principal goal of supporting secure network
   management, the design of this SNMP Security Model is also influenced
   by the following constraints:

   1) When the requirements of effective management in times of
      network stress are inconsistent with those of security, the design
      should prefer the former.

   2) Neither the security protocol nor its underlying security
      mechanisms should depend upon the ready availability of other
      network services (e.g., Network Time Protocol (NTP) or key
      management protocols).

   3) A security mechanism should entail no changes to the basic
      SNMP network management philosophy.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.%20%20Security%20Services"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Security Services</span>

   The security services necessary to support the goals of this SNMP
   Security Model are as follows:

   - Data Integrity
     is the provision of the property that data has not been altered or
     destroyed in an unauthorized manner, nor have data sequences been
     altered to an extent greater than can occur non-maliciously.

   - Data Origin Authentication
     is the provision of the property that the claimed identity of the
     user on whose behalf received data was originated is corroborated.

   - Data Confidentiality
     is the provision of the property that information is not made
     available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or
     processes.

   - Message timeliness and limited replay protection
     is the provision of the property that a message whose generation
     time is outside of a specified time window is not accepted.  Note
     that message reordering is not dealt with and can occur in normal
     conditions too.

   For the protocols specified in this memo, it is not possible to
   assure the specific originator of a received SNMP message; rather, it
   is the user on whose behalf the message was originated that is
   authenticated.

   For these protocols, it not possible to obtain data integrity without
   data origin authentication, nor is it possible to obtain data origin
   authentication without data integrity.  Further, there is no
   provision for data confidentiality without both data integrity and
   data origin authentication.

   The security protocols used in this memo are considered acceptably
   secure at the time of writing.  However, the procedures allow for new
   authentication and privacy methods to be specified at a future time
   if the need arises.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.4.%20%20Module%20Organization"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4" name="section-1.4">1.4</a>.  Module Organization</span>

   The security protocols defined in this memo are split in three
   different modules and each has its specific responsibilities such
   that together they realize the goals and security services described
   above:

   - The authentication module MUST provide for:

     - Data Integrity,

     - Data Origin Authentication

   - The timeliness module MUST provide for:

     - Protection against message delay or replay (to an extent
       greater than can occur through normal operation)

     The privacy module MUST provide for

     - Protection against disclosure of the message payload.

   The timeliness module is fixed for the User-based Security Model
   while there is provision for multiple authentication and/or privacy
   modules, each of which implements a specific authentication or
   privacy protocol respectively.

   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> (Elements of Procedure) uses the timeliness values in an
   SNMP message to do timeliness checking.  The timeliness check is only
   performed if authentication is applied to the message.  Since the

   complete message is checked for integrity, we can assume that the
   timeliness values in a message that passes the authentication module
   are trustworthy.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.4.2.%20%20Authentication%20Protocol"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4.2" name="section-1.4.2">1.4.2</a>.  Authentication Protocol</span>

   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> describes the HMAC-MD5-96 authentication protocol which is
   the first authentication protocol that MUST be supported with the
   User-based Security Model.  <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> describes the HMAC-SHA-96
   authentication protocol which is another authentication protocol that
   SHOULD be supported with the User-based Security Model.  In the
   future additional or replacement authentication protocols may be
   defined as new needs arise.

   The User-based Security Model prescribes that, if authentication is
   used, then the complete message is checked for integrity in the
   authentication module.

   For a message to be authenticated, it needs to pass authentication
   check by the authentication module and the timeliness check which is
   a fixed part of this User-based Security model.

   <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> describes the CBC-DES Symmetric Encryption Protocol which
   is the first privacy protocol to be used with the User-based Security
   Model.  In the future additional or replacement privacy protocols may
   be defined as new needs arise.

   The User-based Security Model prescribes that the scopedPDU is
   protected from disclosure when a message is sent with privacy.

   The User-based Security Model also prescribes that a message needs to
   be authenticated if privacy is in use.

   In order to protect against message replay, delay and redirection,
   one of the SNMP engines involved in each communication is designated
   to be the authoritative SNMP engine.  When an SNMP message contains a
   payload which expects a response (for example a Get, GetNext,
   GetBulk, Set or Inform PDU), then the receiver of such messages is
   authoritative.  When an SNMP message contains a payload which does
   not expect a response (for example an SNMPv2-Trap, Response or Report
   PDU), then the sender of such a message is authoritative.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2274.html">RFC 2274</a>                     USM for SNMPv3                 January 1998</span>


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.5.2.%20%20Mechanisms"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.5.2" name="section-1.5.2">1.5.2</a>.  Mechanisms</span>

   The following mechanisms are used:

   1) To protect against the threat of message delay or replay (to an
      extent greater than can occur through normal operation), a set of
      timeliness indicators (for the authoritative SNMP engine) are
      included in each message generated.  An SNMP engine evaluates the
      timeliness indicators to determine if a received message is
      recent.  An SNMP engine may evaluate the timeliness indicators to
      ensure that a received message is at least as recent as the last
      message it received from the same source.  A non-authoritative
      SNMP engine uses received authentic messages to advance its notion
      of the timeliness indicators at the remote authoritative source.

      An SNMP engine MUST also use a mechanism to match incoming
      Responses to outstanding Requests and it MUST drop any Responses
      that do not match an outstanding request. For example, a msgID can
      be inserted in every message to cater for this functionality.

      These mechanisms provide for the detection of authenticated
      messages whose time of generation was not recent.

      This protection against the threat of message delay or replay does
      not imply nor provide any protection against unauthorized deletion
      or suppression of messages.  Also, an SNMP engine may not be able
      to detect message reordering if all the messages involved are sent
      within the Time Window interval.  Other mechanisms defined
      independently of the security protocol can also be used to detect
      the re-ordering replay, deletion, or suppression of messages
      containing Set operations (e.g., the MIB variable snmpSetSerialNo
      [<a href="rfc1907.html" title='"Management Information Base for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1907</a>]).

   2) Verification that a message sent to/from one authoritative SNMP
      engine cannot be replayed to/as-if-from another authoritative SNMP
      engine.

      Included in each message is an identifier unique to the
      authoritative SNMP engine associated with the sender or intended
      recipient of the message.

      A Report, Response or Trap message sent by an authoritative SNMP
      engine to one non-authoritative SNMP engine can potentially be
      replayed to another non-authoritative SNMP engine. The latter
      non-authoritative SNMP engine might (if it knows about the same
      userName with the same secrets at the authoritative SNMP engine)
      as a result update its notion of timeliness indicators of the
      authoritative SNMP engine, but that is not considered a threat.



<span class="grey">Blumenthal &amp; Wijnen         Standards Track                     [Page 9]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-10" id="page-10" name="page-10"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2274.html">RFC 2274</a>                     USM for SNMPv3                 January 1998</span>


      In this case, A Report or Response message will be discarded by
      the Message Processing Model, because there should not be an
      outstanding Request message. A Trap will possibly be accepted.
      Again, that is not considered a threat, because the communication
      was authenticated and timely. It is as if the authoritative SNMP
      engine was configured to start sending Traps to the second SNMP
      engine, which theoretically can happen without the knowledge of
      the second SNMP engine anyway. Anyway, the second SNMP engine may
      not expect to receive this Trap, but is allowed to see the
      management information contained in it.

   3) Detection of messages which were not recently generated.

      A set of time indicators are included in the message, indicating
      the time of generation.  Messages without recent time indicators
      are not considered authentic.  In addition, an SNMP engine MUST
      drop any Responses that do not match an outstanding request. This
      however is the responsibility of the Message Processing Model.

   This memo allows the same user to be defined on multiple SNMP
   engines.  Each SNMP engine maintains a value, snmpEngineID, which
   uniquely identifies the SNMP engine.  This value is included in each
   message sent to/from the SNMP engine that is authoritative (see
   <a href="#section-1.5.1">section 1.5.1</a>).  On receipt of a message, an authoritative SNMP
   engine checks the value to ensure that it is the intended recipient,
   and a non-authoritative SNMP engine uses the value to ensure that the
   message is processed using the correct state information.

   Each SNMP engine maintains two values, snmpEngineBoots and
   snmpEngineTime, which taken together provide an indication of time at
   that SNMP engine.  Both of these values are included in an
   authenticated message sent to/received from that SNMP engine.  On
   receipt, the values are checked to ensure that the indicated
   timeliness value is within a Time Window of the current time.  The
   Time Window represents an administrative upper bound on acceptable
   delivery delay for protocol messages.

   For an SNMP engine to generate a message which an authoritative SNMP
   engine will accept as authentic, and to verify that a message
   received from that authoritative SNMP engine is authentic, such an
   SNMP engine must first achieve timeliness synchronization with the
   authoritative SNMP engine. See <a href="#section-2.3">section 2.3</a>.

   defined within the User-based Security Model (USM) to describe the
   conceptual interfaces between the generic USM services and the self-
   contained authentication and privacy services.

   These abstract service interfaces are defined by a set of primitives
   that define the services provided and the abstract data elements that
   must be passed when the services are invoked. This section lists the
   primitives that have been defined for the User-based Security Model.

   This section contains definitions required to realize the security
   model defined by this memo.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20User-based%20Security%20Model%20Users"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  User-based Security Model Users</span>

   Management operations using this Security Model make use of a defined
   set of user identities.  For any user on whose behalf management
   operations are authorized at a particular SNMP engine, that SNMP
   engine must have knowledge of that user.  An SNMP engine that wishes
   to communicate with another SNMP engine must also have knowledge of a
   user known to that engine, including knowledge of the applicable
   attributes of that user.

   A user and its attributes are defined as follows:

   userName
     A string representing the name of the user.

   securityName
     A human-readable string representing the user in a format that is
     Security Model independent.

   authProtocol
     An indication of whether messages sent on behalf of this user can
     be authenticated, and if so, the type of authentication protocol
     which is used.  Two such protocols are defined in this memo:
       - the HMAC-MD5-96 authentication protocol.
       - the HMAC-SHA-96 authentication protocol.

   authKey
     If messages sent on behalf of this user can be authenticated,
     the (private) authentication key for use with the authentication
     protocol.  Note that a user's authentication key will normally
     be different at different authoritative SNMP engines. The authKey
     is not accessible via SNMP. The length requirements of the authKey
     are defined by the authProtocol in use.

   authKeyChange and authOwnKeyChange
     The only way to remotely update the authentication key.  Does
     that in a secure manner, so that the update can be completed
     without the need to employ privacy protection.

   privProtocol
     An indication of whether messages sent on behalf of this user
     can be protected from disclosure, and if so, the type of privacy
     protocol which is used.  One such protocol is defined in this
     memo: the CBC-DES Symmetric Encryption Protocol.

   privKey
     If messages sent on behalf of this user can be en/decrypted,
     the (private) privacy key for use with the privacy protocol.
     Note that a user's privacy key will normally be different at
     different authoritative SNMP engines. The privKey is not
     accessible via SNMP. The length requirements of the privKey are
     defined by the privProtocol in use.

   privKeyChange and privOwnKeyChange
     The only way to remotely update the encryption key. Does that

   Each SNMP engine maintains three objects:

   - snmpEngineID, which (at least within an administrative domain)
     uniquely and unambiguously identifies an SNMP engine.

   - snmpEngineBoots, which is a count of the number of times the
     SNMP engine has re-booted/re-initialized since snmpEngineID
     was last configured; and,

   - snmpEngineTime, which is the number of seconds since the
     snmpEngineBoots counter was last incremented.

   Each SNMP engine is always authoritative with respect to these
   objects in its own SNMP entity.  It is the responsibility of a
   non-authoritative SNMP engine to synchronize with the
   authoritative SNMP engine, as appropriate.

   An authoritative SNMP engine is required to maintain the values of
   its snmpEngineID and snmpEngineBoots in non-volatile storage.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.1.%20%20msgAuthoritativeEngineID"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.1" name="section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  msgAuthoritativeEngineID</span>

   The msgAuthoritativeEngineID value contained in an authenticated
   message is used to defeat attacks in which messages from one SNMP
   engine to another SNMP engine are replayed to a different SNMP
   engine. It represents the snmpEngineID at the authoritative SNMP
   engine involved in the exchange of the message.

   When an authoritative SNMP engine is first installed, it sets its
   local value of snmpEngineID according to a enterprise-specific
   algorithm (see the definition of the Textual Convention for
   SnmpEngineID in the SNMP Architecture document [<a href="rfc2271.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2271</a>]).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.2.%20%20msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots%20and%20msgAuthoritativeEngineTime"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.2" name="section-2.2.2">2.2.2</a>.  msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots and msgAuthoritativeEngineTime</span>

   The msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots and msgAuthoritativeEngineTime
   values contained in an authenticated message are used to defeat
   attacks in which messages are replayed when they are no longer
   valid.  They represent the snmpEngineBoots and snmpEngineTime
   values at the authoritative SNMP engine involved in the exchange
   of the message.

   Through use of snmpEngineBoots and snmpEngineTime, there is no
   requirement for an SNMP engine to have a non-volatile clock which
   ticks (i.e., increases with the passage of time) even when the
   SNMP engine is powered off.  Rather, each time an SNMP engine
   re-boots, it retrieves, increments, and then stores snmpEngineBoots
   in non-volatile storage, and resets snmpEngineTime to zero.

   When an SNMP engine is first installed, it sets its local values
   of snmpEngineBoots and snmpEngineTime to zero.  If snmpEngineTime
   ever reaches its maximum value (2147483647), then snmpEngineBoots
   is incremented as if the SNMP engine has re-booted and
   snmpEngineTime is reset to zero and starts incrementing again.

   Each time an authoritative SNMP engine re-boots, any SNMP engines
   holding that authoritative SNMP engine's values of snmpEngineBoots
   and snmpEngineTime need to re-synchronize prior to sending
   correctly authenticated messages to that authoritative SNMP engine
   (see <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a> for (re-)synchronization procedures).  Note,
   however, that the procedures do provide for a notification to be
   accepted as authentic by a receiving SNMP engine, when sent by an
   authoritative SNMP engine which has re-booted since the receiving
   SNMP engine last (re-)synchronized.

   If an authoritative SNMP engine is ever unable to determine its
   latest snmpEngineBoots value, then it must set its snmpEngineBoots
   value to 2147483647.

   Whenever the local value of snmpEngineBoots has the value 2147483647
   it latches at that value and an authenticated message always causes
   an notInTimeWindow authentication failure.

   In order to reset an SNMP engine whose snmpEngineBoots value has
   reached the value 2147483647, manual intervention is required.
   The engine must be physically visited and re-configured, either

   with a new snmpEngineID value, or with new secret values for the
   authentication and privacy protocols of all users known to that
   SNMP engine. Note that even if an SNMP engine re-boots once a second
   that it would still take approximately 68 years before the max value
   of 2147483647 would be reached.

   The Time Window is a value that specifies the window of time in
   which a message generated on behalf of any user is valid.  This
   memo specifies that the same value of the Time Window, 150 seconds,
   is used for all users.

   Time synchronization, required by a non-authoritative SNMP engine
   in order to proceed with authentic communications, has occurred
   when the non-authoritative SNMP engine has obtained a local notion
   of the authoritative SNMP engine's values of snmpEngineBoots and
   snmpEngineTime from the authoritative SNMP engine.  These values
   must be (and remain) within the authoritative SNMP engine's Time
   Window.  So the local notion of the authoritative SNMP engine's
   values must be kept loosely synchronized with the values stored
   at the authoritative SNMP engine.  In addition to keeping a local
   copy of snmpEngineBoots and snmpEngineTime from the authoritative
   SNMP engine, a non-authoritative SNMP engine must also keep one
   local variable, latestReceivedEngineTime.  This value records the
   highest value of snmpEngineTime that was received by the
   non-authoritative SNMP engine from the authoritative SNMP engine
   and is used to eliminate the possibility of replaying messages
   that would prevent the non-authoritative SNMP engine's notion of
   the snmpEngineTime from advancing.

   A non-authoritative SNMP engine must keep local notions of these
   values for each authoritative SNMP engine with which it wishes to
   communicate.  Since each authoritative SNMP engine is uniquely
   and unambiguously identified by its value of snmpEngineID, the
   non-authoritative SNMP engine may use this value as a key in
   order to cache its local notions of these values.

   Time synchronization occurs as part of the procedures of receiving
   an SNMP message (<a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>, step 7b). As such, no explicit time
   synchronization procedure is required by a non-authoritative SNMP
   engine.  Note, that whenever the local value of snmpEngineID is
   changed (e.g., through discovery) or when secure communications
   are first established with an authoritative SNMP engine, the local

   values of snmpEngineBoots and latestReceivedEngineTime should be
   set to zero.  This will cause the time synchronization to occur

   The syntax of an SNMP message using this Security Model adheres
   to the message format defined in the version-specific Message
   Processing Model document (for example [<a href="rfc2272.html" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2272</a>]).

   The field msgSecurityParameters in SNMPv3 messages has a data type
   of OCTET STRING.  Its value is the BER serialization of the
   following ASN.1 sequence:

     at the authoritative SNMP engine involved in the exchange of the
     message.

   - The msgUserName specifies the user (principal) on whose behalf
     the message is being exchanged.

   This section describes the services provided by the User-based
   Security Model with their inputs and outputs.

   The services are described as primitives of an abstract service

   When the Message Processing (MP) Subsystem invokes the User-based
   Security module to secure an outgoing SNMP message, it must use the
   appropriate service as provided by the Security module.  These two
   services are provided:

   1) A service to generate a Request message. The abstract service
      primitive is:

   2) A service to generate a Response message. The abstract service
      primitive is:

        OUT  wholeMsgLength          -- length of generated message
             )

   The abstract data elements passed as parameters in the abstract
   service primitives are as follows:

    statusInformation
      An indication of whether the encoding and securing of the message
      was successful.  If not it is an indication of the problem.
     essageProcessingModel
      The SNMP version number for the message to be generated.  This
      data is not used by the User-based Security module.
    globalData
      The message header (i.e., its administrative information). This
      data is not used by the User-based Security module.
    maxMessageSize
      The maximum message size as included in the message.  This data is
      not used by the User-based Security module.
    securityParameters
      These are the security parameters. They will be filled in by the
      User-based Security module.
    securityModel
      The securityModel in use. Should be User-based Security Model.
      This data is not used by the User-based Security module.
    securityName
      Together with the snmpEngineID it identifies a row in the
      usmUserTable that is to be used for securing the message.  The
      securityName has a format that is independent of the Security
      Model. In case of a response this parameter is ignored and the
      value from the cache is used.
    securityLevel
      The Level of Security from which the User-based Security module

      The snmpEngineID of the authoritative SNMP engine to which a

   returns statusInformation. If the process was successful, the
   completed message with privacy and authentication applied if such was
   requested by the specified securityLevel is returned. If the process
   was not successful, then an errorIndication is returned.

   The abstract data elements passed as parameters in the abstract
   service primitives are as follows:

    statusInformation
      An indication of whether the process was successful or not.  If
      not, then the statusInformation includes the OID and the value of
      the error counter that was incremented.
    messageProcessingModel
      The SNMP version number as received in the message.  This data is
      not used by the User-based Security module.
    maxMessageSize
      The maximum message size as included in the message.  The User-
      based Security module uses this value to calculate the
      maxSizeResponseScopedPDU.
    securityParameters
      These are the security parameters as received in the message.
    securityModel
      The securityModel in use.  Should be the User-based Security
      Model.  This data is not used by the User-based Security module.
    securityLevel
      The Level of Security from which the User-based Security module
      determines if the message needs to be protected from disclosure
      and if the message needs to be authenticated.
    wholeMsg
      The whole message as it was received.
    wholeMsgLength
      The length of the message as it was received (wholeMsg).
    securityEngineID
      The snmpEngineID that was extracted from the field
      msgAuthoritativeEngineID and that was used to lookup the secrets
      in the usmUserTable.
    securityName
      The security name representing the user on whose behalf the
      message was received.  The securityName has a format that is
      independent of the Security Model.
    scopedPDU
      The message payload.  The data is opaque as far as the User-based
      Security Model is concerned.
    maxSizeResponseScopedPDU
      The maximum size of a scopedPDU to be included in a possible
      Response message.  The User-base Security module calculates

      A handle/reference to cachedSecurityData to be used when securing
      an outgoing Response message.  When the Message Processing
      Subsystem calls the User-based Security module to generate a
      response to this incoming message it must pass this
      handle/reference.

   Upon completion of the process, the User-based Security module
   returns statusInformation and, if the process was successful, the
   additional data elements for further processing of the message.  If
   the process was not successful, then an errorIndication, possibly
   with a OID and value pair of an error counter that was incremented.

   A localized key is a secret key shared between a user U and one
   authoritative SNMP engine E.  Even though a user may have only one
   password and therefore one key for the whole network, the actual
   secrets shared between the user and each authoritative SNMP engine
   will be different. This is achieved by key localization [Localized-
   key].

   First, if a user uses a password, then the user's password is
   converted into a key Ku using one of the two algorithms described in
   Appendices A.2.1 and A.2.2.

   To convert key Ku into a localized key Kul of user U at the
   authoritative SNMP engine E, one appends the snmpEngineID of the
   authoritative SNMP engine to the key Ku and then appends the key Ku
   to the result, thus enveloping the snmpEngineID within the two copies
   of user's key Ku. Then one runs a secure hash function (which one
   depends on the authentication protocol defined for this user U at
   authoritative SNMP engine E; this document defines two authentication
   protocols with their associated algorithms based on MD5 and SHA). The
   output of the hash-function is the localized key Kul for user U at
   the authoritative SNMP engine E.

   This section describes the procedure followed by an SNMP engine
   whenever it generates a message containing a management operation
   (like a request, a response, a notification, or a report) on behalf
   of a user, with a particular securityLevel.

   1)  a) If any securityStateReference is passed (Response message),
          then information concerning the user is extracted from the
          cachedSecurityData.  The securityEngineID and the
          securityLevel are extracted from the cachedSecurityData.  The
          cachedSecurityData can now be discarded.

          Otherwise,

       b) based on the securityName, information concerning the
          user at the destination snmpEngineID, specified by the
          securityEngineID, is extracted from the Local Configuration
          Datastore (LCD, usmUserTable). If information about the user
          is absent from the LCD, then an error indication
          (unknownSecurityName) is returned to the calling module.

   2)  If the securityLevel specifies that the message is to be
       protected from disclosure, but the user does not support both an
       authentication and a privacy protocol then the message cannot be
       sent.  An error indication (unsupportedSecurityLevel) is returned
       to the calling module.

   3)  If the securityLevel specifies that the message is to be
       authenticated, but the user does not support an authentication
       protocol, then the message cannot be sent. An error indication
       (unsupportedSecurityLevel) is returned to the calling module.

   4)  a) If the securityLevel specifies that the message is to be
          protected from disclosure, then the octet sequence
          representing the serialized scopedPDU is encrypted according
          to the user's privacy protocol. To do so a call is made to the
          privacy module that implements the user's privacy protocol
          according to the abstract primitive:

          statusInformation =       -- success or failure
            encryptData(
            IN    encryptKey        -- user's localized privKey
            IN    dataToEncrypt     -- serialized scopedPDU
            OUT   encryptedData     -- serialized encryptedPDU
            OUT   privParameters    -- serialized privacy parameters
                  )

          statusInformation
            indicates if the encryption process was successful or not.
          encryptKey
            the user's localized private privKey is the secret key that
            can be used by the encryption algorithm.
          dataToEncrypt
            the serialized scopedPDU is the data that to be encrypted.
          encryptedData
            the encryptedPDU represents the encrypted scopedPDU,
            encoded as an OCTET STRING.
          privParameters
            the privacy parameters, encoded as an OCTET STRING.

          If the privacy module returns failure, then the message cannot
          be sent and an error indication (encryptionError) is returned
          to the calling module.

          If the privacy module returns success, then the returned
          privParameters are put into the msgPrivacyParameters field of
          the securityParameters and the encryptedPDU serves as the
          payload of the message being prepared.

          Otherwise,

       b) If the securityLevel specifies that the message is not to be
          protected from disclosure, then the NULL string is encoded as
          an OCTET STRING and put into the msgPrivacyParameters field of
          the securityParameters and the plaintext scopedPDU serves as
          the payload of the message being prepared.

   5)  The snmpEngineID is encoded as an OCTET STRING into the
       msgAuthoritativeEngineID field of the securityParameters.  Note
       that an empty (zero length) snmpEngineID is OK for a Request
       message, because that will cause the remote (authoritative) SNMP
       engine to return a Report PDU with the proper snmpEngineID
       included in the msgAuthoritativeEngineID in the
       securityParameters of that returned Report PDU.

   6)  a) If the securityLevel specifies that the message is to be
          authenticated, then the current values of snmpEngineBoots and
          snmpEngineTime corresponding to the snmpEngineID from the LCD
          are used.

          Otherwise,

       b) If this is a Response message, then the current value of
          snmpEngineBoots and snmpEngineTime corresponding to the local
          snmpEngineID from the LCD are used.

          Otherwise,

       c) If this is a Request message, then a zero value is used
          for both snmpEngineBoots and snmpEngineTime. This zero value
          gets used if snmpEngineID is empty.

       The values are encoded as INTEGER respectively into the
       msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots and msgAuthoritativeEngineTime fields
       of the securityParameters.

   7)  The userName is encoded as an OCTET STRING into the msgUserName
       field of the securityParameters.

   8)  a) If the securityLevel specifies that the message is to be
          authenticated, the message is authenticated according to the
          user's authentication protocol. To do so a call is made to the
          authentication module that implements the user's
          authentication protocol according to the abstract service
          primitive:

          statusInformation =
            authenticateOutgoingMsg(
            IN  authKey               -- the user's localized authKey
            IN  wholeMsg              -- unauthenticated message
            OUT authenticatedWholeMsg -- authenticated complete message
                )

          statusInformation
            indicates if authentication was successful or not.
          authKey
            the user's localized private authKey is the secret key that
            can be used by the authentication algorithm.
          wholeMsg
            the complete serialized message to be authenticated.
          authenticatedWholeMsg
            the same as the input given to the authenticateOutgoingMsg
            service, but with msgAuthenticationParameters properly
            filled in.

          If the authentication module returns failure, then the message
          cannot be sent and an error indication (authenticationFailure)
          is returned to the calling module.

          If the authentication module returns success, then the
          msgAuthenticationParameters field is put into the
          securityParameters and the authenticatedWholeMsg represents
          the serialization of the authenticated message being prepared.

          Otherwise,

       b) If the securityLevel specifies that the message is not to
          be authenticated then the NULL string is encoded as an OCTET
          STRING into the msgAuthenticationParameters field of the
          securityParameters.  The wholeMsg is now serialized and then
          represents the unauthenticated message being prepared.

   9)  The completed message with its length is returned to the
       calling module with the statusInformation set to success.

   This section describes the procedure followed by an SNMP engine
   whenever it receives a message containing a management operation on
   behalf of a user, with a particular securityLevel.

   To simplify the elements of procedure, the release of state
   information is not always explicitly specified. As a general rule, if
   state information is available when a message gets discarded, the
   state information should also be released.  Also, when an error
   indication with an OID and value for an incremented counter is
   returned, then the available information (like
   securityStateReference) must be passed back to the caller so it can
   generate a Report PDU.

   1)  If the received securityParameters is not the serialization
       (according to the conventions of [<a href="rfc1906.html" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1906</a>]) of an OCTET STRING
       formatted according to the UsmSecurityParameters defined in
       <a href="#section-2.4">section 2.4</a>, then the snmpInASNParseErrs counter [<a href="rfc1907.html" title='"Management Information Base for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1907</a>] is
       incremented, and an error indication (parseError) is returned to
       the calling module.  Note that we return without the OID and
       value of the incremented counter, because in this case there is
       not enough information to generate a Report PDU.

   2)  The values of the security parameter fields are extracted from
       the securityParameters. The securityEngineID to be returned to
       the caller is the value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineID field.
       The cachedSecurityData is prepared and a securityStateReference
       is prepared to reference this data. Values to be cached are:

           msgUserName
           securityEngineID
           securityLevel

   3)  If the value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineID field in the
       securityParameters is unknown then:

       a) a non-authoritative SNMP engine that performs discovery may
          optionally create a new entry in its Local Configuration
          Datastore (LCD) and continue processing;

          or

       b) the usmStatsUnknownEngineIDs counter is incremented, and
          an error indication (unknownEngineID) together with the
          OID and value of the incremented counter is returned to
          the calling module.

   4)  Information about the value of the msgUserName and
       msgAuthoritativeEngineID fields is extracted from the Local
       Configuration Datastore (LCD, usmUserTable).  If no information
       is available for the user, then the usmStatsUnknownUserNames
       counter is incremented and an error indication
       (unknownSecurityName) together with the OID and value of the
       incremented counter is returned to the calling module.

   5)  If the information about the user indicates that it does not
       support the securityLevel requested by the caller, then the
       usmStatsUnsupportedSecLevels counter is incremented and an
       error indication (unsupportedSecurityLevel) together with the
       OID and value of the incremented counter is returned to the
       calling module.

   6)  If the securityLevel specifies that the message is to be
       authenticated, then the message is authenticated according to
       the user's authentication protocol. To do so a call is made
       to the authentication module that implements the user's
       authentication protocol according to the abstract service
       primitive:

       statusInformation =          -- success or failure
         authenticateIncomingMsg(
         IN   authKey               -- the user's localized authKey
         IN   authParameters        -- as received on the wire
         IN   wholeMsg              -- as received on the wire
         OUT  authenticatedWholeMsg -- checked for authentication
                 )

       statusInformation
         indicates if authentication was successful or not.
       authKey
         the user's localized private authKey is the secret key that
         can be used by the authentication algorithm.
       wholeMsg
         the complete serialized message to be authenticated.

         service, but after authentication has been checked.

       If the authentication module returns failure, then the message
              cannot be trusted, so the usmStatsWrongDigests counter is
       incremented and an error indication (authenticationFailure)
       together with the OID and value of the incremented counter is
       returned to the calling module.

       If the authentication module returns success, then the message
       is authentic and can be trusted so processing continues.

   7)  If the securityLevel indicates an authenticated message, then
       the local values of snmpEngineBoots and snmpEngineTime
       corresponding to the value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineID
       field are extracted from the Local Configuration Datastore.

       a) If the extracted value of msgAuthoritativeEngineID is the
          same as the value of snmpEngineID of the processing SNMP
          engine (meaning this is the authoritative SNMP engine),
          then if any of the following conditions is true, then the
          message is considered to be outside of the Time Window:

           - the local value of snmpEngineBoots is 2147483647;

           - the value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots field differs
             from the local value of snmpEngineBoots; or,

           - the value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineTime field differs
             from the local notion of snmpEngineTime by more than
             +/- 150 seconds.

          If the message is considered to be outside of the Time Window
          then the usmStatsNotInTimeWindows counter is incremented and
          an error indication (notInTimeWindow) together with the OID
          and value of the incremented counter is returned to the
          calling module.

       b) If the extracted value of msgAuthoritativeEngineID is not the
          same as the value snmpEngineID of the processing SNMP engine
          (meaning this is not the authoritative SNMP engine), then:

          1) if at least one of the following conditions is true:

             - the extracted value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots
               field is greater than the local notion of the value of
               snmpEngineBoots; or,

             - the extracted value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots
               field is equal to the local notion of the value of
               snmpEngineBoots, the extracted value of
               msgAuthoritativeEngineTime field is greater than the
               value of latestReceivedEngineTime,

             then the LCD entry corresponding to the extracted value
             of the msgAuthoritativeEngineID field is updated, by
             setting:

                - the local notion of the value of snmpEngineBoots to
                  the value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots field,
                - the local notion of the value of snmpEngineTime to
                  the value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineTime field,
                  and
                - the latestReceivedEngineTime to the value of the
                  value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineTime field.

          2) if any of the following conditions is true, then the
             message is considered to be outside of the Time Window:

             - the local notion of the value of snmpEngineBoots is
               2147483647;

             - the value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots field is
               less than the local notion of the value of
               snmpEngineBoots; or,

             - the value of the msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots field is
               equal to the local notion of the value of
               snmpEngineBoots and the value of the
               msgAuthoritativeEngineTime field is more than 150
               seconds less than the local notion of of the value of
               snmpEngineTime.

             If the message is considered to be outside of the Time
             Window then an error indication (notInTimeWindow) is
             returned to the calling module;

             Note that this means that a too old (possibly replayed)
             message has been detected and is deemed unauthentic.

             Note that this procedure allows for the value of
             msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots in the message to be greater
             than the local notion of the value of snmpEngineBoots to
             allow for received messages to be accepted as authentic

             when received from an authoritative SNMP engine that has
             re-booted since the receiving SNMP engine last
             (re-)synchronized.

             Note that this procedure does not allow for automatic
             time synchronization if the non-authoritative SNMP engine
             has a real out-of-sync situation whereby the authoritative
             SNMP engine is more than 150 seconds behind the
             non-authoritative SNMP engine.

   8)  a) If the securityLevel indicates that the message was protected
          from disclosure, then the OCTET STRING representing the
          encryptedPDU is decrypted according to the user's privacy
          protocol to obtain an unencrypted serialized scopedPDU value.
          To do so a call is made to the privacy module that implements
          the user's privacy protocol according to the abstract
          primitive:

          statusInformation =       -- success or failure
            decryptData(
            IN    decryptKey        -- the user's localized privKey
            IN    privParameters    -- as received on the wire
            IN    encryptedData     -- encryptedPDU as received
            OUT   decryptedData     -- serialized decrypted scopedPDU
                  )

          statusInformation
            indicates if the decryption process was successful or not.
          decryptKey
            the user's localized private privKey is the secret key that
            can be used by the decryption algorithm.
          privParameters
            the msgPrivacyParameters, encoded as an OCTET STRING.
          encryptedData
            the encryptedPDU represents the encrypted scopedPDU, encoded
            as an OCTET STRING.
          decryptedData
            the serialized scopedPDU if decryption is successful.

          If the privacy module returns failure, then the message can
          not be processed, so the usmStatsDecryptionErrors counter is
          incremented and an error indication (decryptionError) together
          with the OID and value of the incremented counter is returned
          to the calling module.

          If the privacy module returns success, then the decrypted
          scopedPDU is the message payload to be returned to the calling
          module.

          Otherwise,

       b) The scopedPDU component is assumed to be in plain text
          and is the message payload to be returned to the calling
          module.

   9)  The maxSizeResponseScopedPDU is calculated.  This is the
       maximum size allowed for a scopedPDU for a possible Response
       message.  Provision is made for a message header that allows the
       same securityLevel as the received Request.

   10) The securityName for the user is retrieved from the
       usmUserTable.

   11) The security data is cached as cachedSecurityData, so that a
       possible response to this message can and will use the same
       authentication and privacy secrets, the same securityLevel and
       the same value for msgAuthoritativeEngineID.  Information to be
       saved/cached is as follows:

          securityEngineID, securityLevel

   12) The statusInformation is set to success and a return is made to
       the calling module passing back the OUT parameters as specified
       in the processIncomingMsg primitive.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Discovery"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Discovery</span>

   The User-based Security Model requires that a discovery process
   obtains sufficient information about other SNMP engines in order to
   communicate with them.  Discovery requires an non-authoritative SNMP
   engine to learn the authoritative SNMP engine's snmpEngineID value
   before communication may proceed.  This may be accomplished by
   generating a Request message with a securityLevel of noAuthNoPriv, a
   msgUserName of "initial", a msgAuthoritativeEngineID value of zero
   length, and the varBindList left empty.  The response to this message
   will be a Report message containing the snmpEngineID of the
   authoritative SNMP engine as the value of the
   msgAuthoritativeEngineID field within the msgSecurityParameters
   field.  It contains a Report PDU with the usmStatsUnknownEngineIDs
   counter in the varBindList.

   If authenticated communication is required, then the discovery
   process should also establish time synchronization with the
   authoritative SNMP engine.  This may be accomplished by sending an

   DESCRIPTION
         "Every definition of an object with this syntax must identify
          a protocol P, a secret key K, and a hash algorithm H
          that produces output of L octets.

          The object's value is a manager-generated, partially-random
          value which, when modified, causes the value of the secret
          key K, to be modified via a one-way function.

          The value of an instance of this object is the concatenation
          of two components: first a 'random' component and then a
          'delta' component.




<span class="grey">Blumenthal &amp; Wijnen         Standards Track                    [Page 33]</span></pre>

          The lengths of the random and delta components
          are given by the corresponding value of the protocol P;
          if P requires K to be a fixed length, the length of both the
          random and delta components is that fixed length; if P
          allows the length of K to be variable up to a particular
          maximum length, the length of the random component is that
          maximum length and the length of the delta component is any
          length less than or equal to that maximum length.
          For example, usmHMACMD5AuthProtocol requires K to be a fixed
          length of 16 octets and L - of 16 octets.
          usmHMACSHAAuthProtocol requires K to be a fixed length of
          20 octets and L - of 20 octets. Other protocols may define
          other sizes, as deemed appropriate.

          When a requestor wants to change the old key K to a new
          key keyNew on a remote entity, the 'random' component is
          obtained from either a true random generator, or from a
          pseudorandom generator, and the 'delta' component is
          computed as follows:

           - a temporary variable is initialized to the existing value
             of K;
           - if the length of the keyNew is greater than L octets,
             then:
              - the random component is appended to the value of the
                temporary variable, and the result is input to the

                the temporary variable is set to this digest value;
              - the value of the temporary variable is XOR-ed with
                the first (next) L-octets (16 octets in case of MD5)
                of the keyNew to produce the first (next) L-octets
                (16 octets in case of MD5) of the 'delta' component.
              - the above two steps are repeated until the unused
                portion of the delta component is L octets or less,

             (final portion of the) 'delta' component.

           For example, using MD5 as the hash algorithm H:

   This section describes the HMAC-MD5-96 authentication protocol.  This
   authentication protocol is the first defined for the User-based
   Security Model. It uses MD5 hash-function which is described in
   [MD5], in HMAC mode described in [<a href="rfc2104.html" title='"HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication"'>RFC2104</a>], truncating the output to
   96 bits.

   This protocol is identified by usmHMACMD5AuthProtocol.

   Over time, other authentication protocols may be defined either as a
   replacement of this protocol or in addition to this protocol.

   - In support of data integrity, a message digest algorithm is
     required.  A digest is calculated over an appropriate portion of an
     SNMP message and included as part of the message sent to the
     recipient.

   - In support of data origin authentication and data integrity,
     a secret value is prepended to SNMP message prior to computing the
     digest; the calculated digest is partially inserted into the SNMP
     message prior to transmission, and the prepended value is not
     transmitted.  The secret value is shared by all SNMP engines
     authorized to originate messages on behalf of the appropriate user.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1.1.%20%20Digest%20Authentication%20Mechanism"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1.1" name="section-6.1.1">6.1.1</a>.  Digest Authentication Mechanism</span>

   The Digest Authentication Mechanism defined in this memo provides
   for:

   - verification of the integrity of a received message, i.e., the
     message received is the message sent.

     The integrity of the message is protected by computing a digest
     over an appropriate portion of the message.  The digest is computed
     by the originator of the message, transmitted with the message, and
     verified by the recipient of the message.

   - verification of the user on whose behalf the message was generated.

     A secret value known only to SNMP engines authorized to generate
     messages on behalf of a user is used in HMAC mode (see [<a href="rfc2104.html" title='"HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication"'>RFC2104</a>]).
     It also recommends the hash-function output used as Message
     Authentication Code, to be truncated.

   This protocol uses the MD5 [MD5] message digest algorithm.  A 128-bit
   MD5 digest is calculated in a special (HMAC) way over the designated
   portion of an SNMP message and the first 96 bits of this digest is
   included as part of the message sent to the recipient. The size of
   the digest carried in a message is 12 octets. The size of the private
   authentication key (the secret) is 16 octets. For the details see
   <a href="#section-6.3">section 6.3</a>.

   Authentication using this authentication protocol makes use of a
   defined set of userNames. For any user on whose behalf a message must
   be authenticated at a particular SNMP engine, that SNMP engine must
   have knowledge of that user. An SNMP engine that wishes to

   communicate with another SNMP engine must also have knowledge of a
   user known to that engine, including knowledge of the applicable
   attributes of that user.

   A user and its attributes are defined as follows:

   &lt;userName&gt;
     A string representing the name of the user.
   &lt;authKey&gt;
     A user's secret key to be used when calculating a digest.
     It MUST be 16 octets long for MD5.

   The msgAuthoritativeEngineID value contained in an authenticated
   message specifies the authoritative SNMP engine for that particular
   message (see the definition of SnmpEngineID in the SNMP Architecture
   document [<a href="rfc2271.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2271</a>]).

   The user's (private) authentication key is normally different at each
   authoritative SNMP engine and so the snmpEngineID is used to select
   the proper key for the authentication process.

   Messages using this authentication protocol carry a
   msgAuthenticationParameters field as part of the
   msgSecurityParameters.  For this protocol, the
   msgAuthenticationParameters field is the serialized OCTET STRING
   representing the first 12 octets of the HMAC-MD5-96 output done over
   the wholeMsg.

   The digest is calculated over the wholeMsg so if a message is
   authenticated, that also means that all the fields in the message are
   intact and have not been tampered with.

         b) obtain IPAD by replicating the octet 0x36 64 times;
         c) obtain K1 by XORing extendedAuthKey with IPAD;
         d) obtain OPAD by replicating the octet 0x5C 64 times;
         e) obtain K2 by XORing extendedAuthKey with OPAD.

   4) Prepend K1 to the wholeMsg and calculate MD5 digest over it
      according to [MD5].

   5) Prepend K2 to the result of the step 4 and calculate MD5 digest
      over it according to [MD5]. Take the first 12 octets of the final
      digest - this is Message Authentication Code (MAC).

   6) Replace the msgAuthenticationParameters field with MAC obtained
      in the step 5.

   This section describes the procedure followed by an SNMP engine
   whenever it must authenticate an incoming message using the
   usmHMACMD5AuthProtocol.

   1)  If the digest received in the msgAuthenticationParameters field
       is not 12 octets long, then an failure and an errorIndication
       (authenticationError) is returned to the calling module.

   2)  The MAC received in the msgAuthenticationParameters field
       is saved.

   3)  The digest in the msgAuthenticationParameters field is replaced
       by the 12 zero octets.

   4)  From the secret authKey, two keys K1 and K2 are derived:

         a) extend the authKey to 64 octets by appending 48 zero
            octets; save it as extendedAuthKey
         b) obtain IPAD by replicating the octet 0x36 64 times;
         c) obtain K1 by XORing extendedAuthKey with IPAD;
         d) obtain OPAD by replicating the octet 0x5C 64 times;
         e) obtain K2 by XORing extendedAuthKey with OPAD.

   5)  The MAC is calculated over the wholeMsg:

         a) prepend K1 to the wholeMsg and calculate the MD5 digest
            over it;
         b) prepend K2 to the result of step 5.a and calculate the
            MD5 digest over it;
         c) first 12 octets of the result of step 5.b is the MAC.

       The msgAuthenticationParameters field is replaced with the MAC
       value that was saved in step 2.

   6)  Then the newly calculated MAC is compared with the MAC
       saved in step 2. If they do not match, then an failure and an
       errorIndication (authenticationFailure) is returned to the
       calling module.

   7)  The authenticatedWholeMsg and statusInformation indicating
       success are then returned to the caller.

   This section describes the HMAC-SHA-96 authentication protocol.  This
   protocol uses the SHA hash-function which is described in [<a href="#ref-SHA-NIST" title="(April">SHA-NIST</a>],
   in HMAC mode described in [<a href="rfc2104.html" title='"HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication"'>RFC2104</a>], truncating the output to 96

   - In support of data integrity, a message digest algorithm is
     required.  A digest is calculated over an appropriate portion of an
     SNMP message and included as part of the message sent to the
     recipient.

   - In support of data origin authentication and data integrity,
     a secret value is prepended to the SNMP message prior to computing
     the digest; the calculated digest is then partially inserted into
     the message prior to transmission. The prepended secret is not
     transmitted.  The secret value is shared by all SNMP engines
     authorized to originate messages on behalf of the appropriate user.

   The Digest Authentication Mechanism defined in this memo provides
   for:

   - verification of the integrity of a received message, i.e., the
     the message received is the message sent.

     The integrity of the message is protected by computing a digest
     over an appropriate portion of the message.  The digest is computed
     by the originator of the message, transmitted with the message, and
     verified by the recipient of the message.

   - verification of the user on whose behalf the message was generated.

     A secret value known only to SNMP engines authorized to generate
     messages on behalf of a user is used in HMAC mode (see [<a href="rfc2104.html" title='"HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication"'>RFC2104</a>]).
     It also recommends the hash-function output used as Message
     Authentication Code, to be truncated.

   This mechanism uses the SHA [<a href="#ref-SHA-NIST" title="(April">SHA-NIST</a>] message digest algorithm.  A
   160-bit SHA digest is calculated in a special (HMAC) way over the
   designated portion of an SNMP message and the first 96 bits of this
   digest is included as part of the message sent to the recipient. The
   size of the digest carried in a message is 12 octets. The size of the
   private authentication key (the secret) is 20 octets. For the details

   Authentication using this authentication protocol makes use of a
   defined set of userNames.  For any user on whose behalf a message
   must be authenticated at a particular SNMP engine, that SNMP engine
   must have knowledge of that user.  An SNMP engine that wishes to
   communicate with another SNMP engine must also have knowledge of a
   user known to that engine, including knowledge of the applicable
   attributes of that user.

   A user and its attributes are defined as follows:

   &lt;userName&gt;
     A string representing the name of the user.
   &lt;authKey&gt;
     A user's secret key to be used when calculating a digest.
     It MUST be 20 octets long for SHA.

   The msgAuthoritativeEngineID value contained in an authenticated
   message specifies the authoritative SNMP engine for that particular
   message (see the definition of SnmpEngineID in the SNMP Architecture
   document [<a href="rfc2271.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2271</a>]).

   The user's (private) authentication key is normally different at each
   authoritative SNMP engine and so the snmpEngineID is used to select
   the proper key for the authentication process.

   Messages using this authentication protocol carry a
   msgAuthenticationParameters field as part of the
   msgSecurityParameters. For this protocol, the
   msgAuthenticationParameters field is the serialized OCTET STRING
   representing the first 12 octets of HMAC-SHA-96 output done over the
   wholeMsg.

   The digest is calculated over the wholeMsg so if a message is
   authenticated, that also means that all the fields in the message are
   intact and have not been tampered with.

   usmHMACSHAAuthProtocol.

   1) The msgAuthenticationParameters field is set to the
      serialization, according to the rules in [<a href="rfc1906.html" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1906</a>], of an OCTET
      STRING containing 12 zero octets.

   The Symmetric Encryption Protocol defined in this memo provides

   Two organizations have published specifications defining the DES: the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [<a href="#ref-DES-NIST" title="(January">DES-NIST</a>] and
   the American National Standards Institute [<a href="#ref-DES-ANSI" title="(December">DES-ANSI</a>].  There is a
   companion Modes of Operation specification for each definition
   ([<a href="#ref-DESO-NIST" title="(December">DESO-NIST</a>] and [<a href="#ref-DESO-ANSI" title="American National Standards Institute. ANSI X3.106-1983">DESO-ANSI</a>], respectively).

   The NIST has published three additional documents that implementors
   may find useful.

   - There is a document with guidelines for implementing and using
     the DES, including functional specifications for the DES and its
     modes of operation [<a href="#ref-DESG-NIST">DESG-NIST</a>].

   - There is a specification of a validation test suite for the DES
     [<a href="#ref-DEST-NIST">DEST-NIST</a>].  The suite is designed to test all aspects of the DES
     and is useful for pinpointing specific problems.

   - There is a specification of a maintenance test for the DES
     [<a href="#ref-DESM-NIST" title="(August">DESM-NIST</a>].  The test utilizes a minimal amount of data and
     processing to test all components of the DES.  It provides a simple

   The first 8 octets of the 16-octet secret (private privacy key) are
   used as a DES key.  Since DES uses only 56 bits, the Least
   Significant Bit in each octet is disregarded.

   The Initialization Vector for encryption is obtained using the
   following procedure.

   The last 8 octets of the 16-octet secret (private privacy key) are
   used as pre-IV.

   In order to ensure that the IV for two different packets encrypted by
   the same key, are not the same (i.e., the IV does not repeat) we need
   to "salt" the pre-IV with something unique per packet.  An 8-octet
   string is used as the "salt".  The concatenation of the generating
   SNMP engine's 32-bit snmpEngineBoots and a local 32-bit integer, that
   the encryption engine maintains, is input to the "salt".  The 32-bit
   integer is initialized to an arbitrary value at boot time.

   The 32-bit snmpEngineBoots is converted to the first 4 octets (Most
   Significant Byte first) of our "salt".  The 32-bit integer is then
   converted to the last 4 octet (Most Significant Byte first) of our
   "salt".  The resulting "salt" is then XOR-ed with the pre-IV. The 8-
   octet "salt" is then put into the privParameters field encoded as an
   OCTET STRING.  The "salt" integer is then modified.  We recommend
   that it be incremented by one and wrap when it reaches the maximum
   value.

   How exactly the value of the "salt" (and thus of the IV) varies, is
   an implementation issue, as long as the measures are taken to avoid
   producing a duplicate IV.

   The "salt" must be placed in the privParameters field to enable the
   receiving entity to compute the correct IV and to decrypt the
   message.

   The data to be encrypted is treated as sequence of octets. Its length
   should be an integral multiple of 8 - and if it is not, the data is
   padded at the end as necessary.  The actual pad value is irrelevant.

   The data is encrypted in Cipher Block Chaining mode.

   The plaintext is divided into 64-bit blocks.

   The plaintext for each block is XOR-ed with the ciphertext of the
   previous block, the result is encrypted and the output of the
   encryption is the ciphertext for the block.  This procedure is
   repeated until there are no more plaintext blocks.

   For the very first block, the Initialization Vector is used instead
   of the ciphertext of the previous block.

   Before decryption, the encrypted data length is verified.  If the
   length of the OCTET STRING to be decrypted is not an integral
   multiple of 8 octets, the decryption process is halted and an
   appropriate exception noted.  When decrypting, the padding is
   ignored.

   The first ciphertext block is decrypted, the decryption output is
   XOR-ed with the Initialization Vector, and the result is the first
   plaintext block.

   Data en/decryption using this Symmetric Encryption Protocol makes use
   of a defined set of userNames.  For any user on whose behalf a
   message must be en/decrypted at a particular SNMP engine, that SNMP
   engine must have knowledge of that user.  An SNMP engine that wishes
   to communicate with another SNMP engine must also have knowledge of a
   user known to that SNMP engine, including knowledge of the applicable
   attributes of that user.

   A user and its attributes are defined as follows:

   &lt;userName&gt;
     An octet string representing the name of the user.
   &lt;privKey&gt;
     A user's secret key to be used as input for the DES key and IV.
     The length of this key MUST be 16 octets.

   The msgAuthoritativeEngineID value contained in an authenticated
   message specifies the authoritative SNMP engine for that particular
   message (see the definition of SnmpEngineID in the SNMP Architecture
   document [<a href="rfc2271.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2271</a>]).

   The user's (private) privacy key is normally different at each
   authoritative SNMP engine and so the snmpEngineID is used to select
   the proper key for the en/decryption process.

   Messages using this privacy protocol carry a msgPrivacyParameters
   field as part of the msgSecurityParameters. For this protocol, the
   msgPrivacyParameters field is the serialized OCTET STRING
   representing the "salt" that was used to create the IV.

   This section describes practices that contribute to the secure,
   effective operation of the mechanisms defined in this memo.

   - An SNMP engine must discard SNMP Response messages that do not
     correspond to any currently outstanding Request message. It is the
     responsibility of the Message Processing module to take care of
     this. For example it can use a msgID for that.

     An SNMP Command Generator Application must discard any Response PDU
     for which there is no currently outstanding Request PDU; for
     example for SNMPv2 [<a href="rfc1905.html" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1905</a>] PDUs, the request-id component in the
     PDU can be used to correlate Responses to outstanding Requests.

     Although it would be typical for an SNMP engine and an SNMP Command
     Generator Application to do this as a matter of course, when using
     these security protocols it is significant due to the possibility
     of message duplication (malicious or otherwise).

   - If an SNMP engine uses a msgID for correlating Response messages
     to outstanding Request messages, then it MUST use different msgIDs
     in all such Request messages that it sends out during a Time Window
     (150 seconds) period.

     A Command Generator or Notification Originator Application MUST use
     different request-ids in all Request PDUs that it sends out during
     a TimeWindow (150 seconds) period.

     This must be done to protect against the possibility of message
     duplication (malicious or otherwise).

     For example, starting operations with a msgID and/or request-id
     value of zero is not a good idea.  Initializing them with an
     unpredictable number (so they do not start out the same after each
     reboot) and then incrementing by one would be acceptable.

   - An SNMP engine should perform time synchronization using
     authenticated messages in order to protect against the possibility
     of message duplication (malicious or otherwise).

   - When sending state altering messages to a managed authoritative
     SNMP engine, a Command Generator Application should delay sending
     successive messages to that managed SNMP engine until a positive
     acknowledgement is received for the previous message or until the
     previous message expires.

     No message ordering is imposed by the SNMP. Messages may be
     received in any order relative to their time of generation and each
     will be processed in the ordered received.  Note that when an
     authenticated message is sent to a managed SNMP engine, it will be
     valid for a period of time of approximately 150 seconds under
     normal circumstances, and is subject to replay during this period.
     Indeed, an SNMP engine and SNMP Command Generator Applications must
     cope with the loss and re-ordering of messages resulting from
     anomalies in the network as a matter of course.

     However, a managed object, snmpSetSerialNo [<a href="rfc1907.html" title='"Management Information Base for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1907</a>], is
     specifically defined for use with SNMP Set operations in order to
     provide a mechanism to ensure that the processing of SNMP messages
     occurs in a specific order.

   - The frequency with which the secrets of a User-based Security
     Model user should be changed is indirectly related to the frequency
     of their use.

     Protecting the secrets from disclosure is critical to the overall
     security of the protocols.  Frequent use of a secret provides a
     continued source of data that may be useful to a cryptanalyst in
     exploiting known or perceived weaknesses in an algorithm.  Frequent
     changes to the secret avoid this vulnerability.

     Changing a secret after each use is generally regarded as the most
     secure practice, but a significant amount of overhead may be
     associated with that approach.

     Note, too, in a local environment the threat of disclosure may be
     less significant, and as such the changing of secrets may be less
     frequent.  However, when public data networks are used as the
     communication paths, more caution is prudent.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.2%20%20Defining%20Users"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.2" name="section-11.2">11.2</a>  Defining Users</span>

   The mechanisms defined in this document employ the notion of users on
   whose behalf messages are sent.  How "users" are defined is subject
   to the security policy of the network administration.  For example,
   users could be individuals (e.g., "joe" or "jane"), or a particular
   role (e.g., "operator" or "administrator"), or a combination (e.g.,
   "joe-operator", "jane-operator" or "joe-admin").  Furthermore, a user
   may be a logical entity, such as an SNMP Application or a set of SNMP
   Applications, acting on behalf of an individual or role, or set of
   individuals, or set of roles, including combinations.

   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> describes an algorithm for mapping a user "password" to a
   16 octet value for use as either a user's authentication key or
   privacy key (or both).  Note however, that using the same password
   (and therefore the same key) for both authentication and privacy is
   very poor security practice and should be strongly discouraged.
   Passwords are often generated, remembered, and input by a human.
   Human-generated passwords may be less than the 16 octets required by
   the authentication and privacy protocols, and brute force attacks can
   be quite easy on a relatively short ASCII character set.  Therefore,
   the algorithm is <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> performs a transformation on the
   password.  If the <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> algorithm is used, SNMP implementations
   (and SNMP configuration applications) must ensure that passwords are
   at least 8 characters in length.

   Because the <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> algorithm uses such passwords (nearly)
   directly, it is very important that they not be easily guessed.  It
   is suggested that they be composed of mixed-case alphanumeric and
   punctuation characters that don't form words or phrases that might be
   found in a dictionary.  Longer passwords improve the security of the
   system.  Users may wish to input multiword phrases to make their
   password string longer while ensuring that it is memorable.

   Since it is infeasible for human users to maintain different
   passwords for every SNMP engine, but security requirements strongly
   discourage having the same key for more than one SNMP engine, the
   User-based Security Model employs a compromise proposed in
   [Localized-key].  It derives the user keys for the SNMP engines from

   user's password in such a way that it is practically impossible to
   either determine the user's password, or user's key for another SNMP
   engine from any combination of user's keys on SNMP engines.

   Note however, that if user's password is disclosed, then key
   localization will not help and network security may be compromised in
   this case. Therefore a user's password or non-localized key MUST NOT
   be stored on a managed device/node. Instead the localized key SHALL
   be stored (if at all) , so that, in case a device does get
   compromised, no other managed or managing devices get compromised.

   To be termed a "Secure SNMP implementation" based on the User-based
   Security Model, an SNMP implementation MUST:

   - implement one or more Authentication Protocol(s). The HMAC-MD5-96
     and HMAC-SHA-96 Authentication Protocols defined in this memo are
     examples of such protocols.

   - to the maximum extent possible, prohibit access to the secret(s)
     of each user about which it maintains information in a Local
     Configuration Datastore (LCD) under all circumstances except as
     required to generate and/or validate SNMP messages with respect to
     that user.

   - implement the key-localization mechanism.

   - implement the SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB.

   In addition, an authoritative SNMP engine SHOULD provide initial
   configuration in accordance with <a href="#appendix-A.1">Appendix A.1</a>.

   Implementation of a Privacy Protocol (the DES Symmetric Encryption
   Protocol defined in this memo is one such protocol) is optional.

APPENDIX A - Installation

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.1.%20%20SNMP%20engine%20Installation%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" name="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  SNMP engine Installation Parameters</span>

   During installation, an authoritative SNMP engine SHOULD (in the
   meaning as defined in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>]) be configured with several initial
   parameters.  These include:

   1) A security posture

      The choice of security posture determines if initial configuration
      is implemented and if so how.  One of three possible choices is
      selected:

            minimum-secure,
            semi-secure,
            very-secure (i.e., no-initial-configuration)

      In the case of a very-secure posture, there is no initial
      configuration, and so the following steps are irrelevant.

2) one or more secrets

   These are the authentication/privacy secrets for the first user to be
   configured.

   One way to accomplish this is to have the installer enter a
   "password" for each required secret. The password is then
   algorithmically converted into the required secret by:

   - forming a string of length 1,048,576 octets by repeating the
     value of the password as often as necessary, truncating
     accordingly, and using the resulting string as the input to the MD5
     algorithm [MD5].  The resulting digest, termed "digest1", is used
     in the next step.

   - a second string is formed by concatenating digest1, the SNMP
     engine's snmpEngineID value, and digest1.  This string is used as
     input to the MD5 algorithm [MD5].

     The resulting digest is the required secret (see <a href="#appendix-A.2">Appendix A.2</a>).

   With these configured parameters, the SNMP engine instantiates the
   following usmUserEntry in the usmUserTable:

   A sample code fragment (section A.2.1) demonstrates the password to
   key algorithm which can be used when mapping a password to an
   authentication or privacy key using MD5. The reference source code of
   MD5 is available in [<a href="rfc1321.html" title='"Message Digest Algorithm MD5"'>RFC1321</a>].

   Another sample code fragment (section A.2.2) demonstrates the
   password to key algorithm which can be used when mapping a password
   to an authentication or privacy key using SHA (documented in SHA-
   NIST).

   An example of the results of a correct implementation is provided
   (section A.3) which an implementor can use to check if his
   implementation produces the same result.

   The following shows a sample output of the password to key algorithm
   for a 16-octet key using MD5.

   With a password of "maplesyrup" the output of the password to key
   algorithm before the key is localized with the SNMP engine's
   snmpEngineID is:

      '9f af 32 83 88 4e 92 83 4e bc 98 47 d8 ed d9 63'H

   The msgSecurityParameters in an SNMP message are represented as an
   OCTET STRING. This OCTET STRING should be considered opaque outside a
   specific Security Model.

   The User-based Security Model defines the contents of the OCTET
   STRING as a SEQUENCE (see <a href="#section-2.4">section 2.4</a>).

   Given these two properties, the following is an example of the
   msgSecurityParameters for the User-based Security Model, encoded as
   an OCTET STRING:

     04 &lt;length&gt;
     30 &lt;length&gt;
     04 &lt;length&gt; &lt;msgAuthoritativeEngineID&gt;
     02 &lt;length&gt; &lt;msgAuthoritativeEngineBoots&gt;
     02 &lt;length&gt; &lt;msgAuthoritativeEngineTime&gt;
     04 &lt;length&gt; &lt;msgUserName&gt;
