<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5404.html">RFC 5404</a>              RTP Payload Format for G.719          January 2009</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document specifies the payload format for packetization of the
   G.719 full-band (FB) codec encoded audio signals into the Real-time
   Transport Protocol (RTP) [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  The payload format supports
   transmission of multiple channels, multiple frames per payload, and
   packet loss robustness methods using redundancy or interleaving.

   This document starts with conventions, a brief description of the
   codec, and the payload format's capabilities.  The payload format is
   specified in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  Examples can be found in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.  The
   media type and its mappings to the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   and usage in SDP offer/answer are then specified.  The document ends
   with considerations regarding congestion control and security.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Definitions%20and%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Definitions and Conventions</span>

   The term "frame-block" is used in this document to describe the time-
   synchronized set of audio frames in a multi-channel audio session.
   In particular, in an N-channel session, a frame-block will contain N
   audio frames, one from each of the channels, and all N speech frames
   represent exactly the same time period.

   This document contains depictions of bit fields.  The most
   significant bit is always leftmost in the figure on each row and has
   the lowest enumeration.  For fields that are depicted over multiple
   rows, the upper row is more significant than the next.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   The ITU-T G.719 full-band codec is a transform coder based on
   Modulated Lapped Transform (MLT).  G.719 is a low-complexity full-
   bandwidth codec for conversational speech and audio coding.  The
   encoder input and decoder output are sampled at 48 kHz.  The codec
   enables full-bandwidth from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, encoding of speech,
   music, and general audio content at rates from 32 kbit/s up to 128
   kbit/s.  The codec operates on 20-ms frames and has an algorithmic
   delay of 40 ms.

   The codec provides excellent quality for speech, music, and other
   types of audio.  Some of the applications for which this coder is
   suitable are:

   o  Real-time communications such as video conferencing and telephony

   o  Streaming audio

   o  Archival and messaging

   The encoding and decoding algorithm can change the bitrate at any
   20-ms frame boundary.  The encoder receives the audio sampled at 48
   kHz.  The support of other sampling rates is possible by re-sampling
   the input signal to the codec's sampling rate, i.e., 48 kHz; however,
   this functionality is not part of the standard.

   The encoding is performed on equally sized frames.  For each frame,
   the encoder decides between two encoding modes, a transient mode and
   a stationary mode.  The decision is based on statistics derived from
   the input signal.  The stationary mode uses a long MLT that leads to
   a spectrum of 960 coefficients, while the transient encoding mode
   uses a short MLT (higher time resolution transform) that results in 4
   spectra (4 x 240 = 960 coefficients).  The encoding of the spectrum
   is done in two steps.  First, the spectral envelope is computed,
   quantized, and Huffman encoded.  The envelope is computed on a non-
   uniform frequency subdivision.  From the coded spectral envelope, a
   weighted spectral envelope is derived and is used for bit allocation;
   this process is also repeated at the decoder.  Thus, only the
   spectral envelope is transmitted.  The output of the bit allocation
   is used in order to quantize the spectra.  In addition, for
   stationary frames, the encoder estimates the amount of noise level.
   The decoder applies the reverse operation upon reception of the bit
   stream.  The non-coded coefficients (i.e., no bits allocated) are
   replaced by entries of a noise codebook that is built based on the
   decoded coefficients.

   This payload format has a number of capabilities, and this section
   discusses them in some detail.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Multi-Rate%20Encoding%20and%20Rate%20Adaptation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Multi-Rate Encoding and Rate Adaptation</span>

   G.719 supports a multi-rate encoding capability that enables on a
   per-frame basis variation of the encoding rate.  This enables support
   for bitrate adaptation and congestion control.  The possibility to
   aggregate multiple audio frames into a single RTP payload is another
   dimension of adaptation.  The RTP and payload format overhead can
   thus be reduced by the aggregation at the cost of increased delay and
   reduced packet-loss robustness.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Support%20for%20Multi-Channel%20Sessions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Support for Multi-Channel Sessions</span>

   The RTP payload format defined in this document supports multi-
   channel audio content (e.g., stereophonic or surround audio
   sessions).  Although the G.719 codec itself does not support encoding
   of multi-channel audio content into a single bit stream, it can be
   used to separately encode and decode each of the individual channels.
   To transport (or store) the separately encoded multi-channel content,
   the audio frames for all channels that are framed and encoded for the
   same 20-ms period are logically collected in a "frame-block".

   At the session setup, out-of-band signaling must be used to indicate
   the number of channels in the payload type.  The order of the audio
   frames within the frame-block depends on the number of the channels
   and follows the definition in <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a> of the RTP/AVP profile
   [<a href="rfc3551.html" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>].  When using SDP for signaling, the number of channels is
   specified in the rtpmap attribute.

   The payload format supports several means, including forward error
   correction (FEC) and frame interleaving, to increase robustness
   against packet loss.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.1.%20%20Use%20of%20Forward%20Error%20Correction%20%28FEC%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.1" name="section-4.3.1">4.3.1</a>.  Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC)</span>

   Generic forward error correction within RTP is defined, for example,
   in <a href="rfc5109.html">RFC 5109</a> [<a href="rfc5109.html" title='"RTP Payload Format for Generic Forward Error Correction"'>RFC5109</a>].  Audio redundancy coding is defined in <a href="rfc2198.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc2198.html">2198</a> [<a href="rfc2198.html" title='"RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data"'>RFC2198</a>].  Either scheme can be used to add redundant
   information to the RTP packet stream and make it more resilient to
   packet losses, at the expense of a higher bitrate.  Please see either
   of the RFCs for a discussion of the implications of the higher
   bitrate to network congestion.

   In addition to these media-unaware mechanisms, this memo specifies a
   G.719-specific form of audio redundancy coding, which may be
   beneficial in terms of packetization overhead.  Conceptually,
   previously transmitted transport frames are aggregated together with
   new ones.  A sliding window can be used to group the frames to be
   sent in each payload.  However, irregular or non-consecutive patterns
   are also possible by inserting NO_DATA frames between primary and
   redundant transmissions.  Figure 1 below shows an example.

              Figure 1: An example of redundant transmission

   Here, each frame is retransmitted once in the following RTP payload
   packet. f(n-2)...f(n+4) denote a sequence of audio frames, and
   p(n-1)...p(n+4) a sequence of payload packets.

   The mechanism described does not really require signaling at the
   session setup.  However, signaling has been defined to allow for the
   sender to voluntarily bind the buffering and delay requirements.  If
   nothing is signaled, the use of this mechanism is allowed and
   unbounded.  For a certain timestamp, the receiver may receive
   multiple copies of a frame containing encoded audio data, even at
   different encoding rates.  The cost of this scheme is bandwidth and
   the receiver delay necessary to allow the redundant copy to arrive.

   This redundancy scheme provides a functionality similar to the one
   described in <a href="rfc2198.html">RFC 2198</a>, but it works only if both original frames and
   redundant representations are G.719 frames.  When the use of other
   media coding schemes is desirable, one has to resort to <a href="rfc2198.html">RFC 2198</a>.

   The sender is responsible for selecting an appropriate amount of
   redundancy based on feedback about the channel conditions, e.g., in
   the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] receiver reports.  The
   sender is also responsible for avoiding congestion, which may be
   exacerbated by redundancy (see <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a> for more details).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.2.%20%20Use%20of%20Frame%20Interleaving"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.2" name="section-4.3.2">4.3.2</a>.  Use of Frame Interleaving</span>

   To decrease protocol overhead, the payload design allows several
   audio transport frames to be encapsulated into a single RTP packet.
   One of the drawbacks of such an approach is that in the case of
   packet loss, several consecutive frames are lost.  Consecutive frame
   loss normally renders error concealment less efficient and usually
   causes clearly audible and annoying distortions in the reconstructed
   audio.  Interleaving of transport frames can improve the audio
   quality in such cases by distributing the consecutive losses into a
   number of isolated frame losses, which are easier to conceal.

   However, interleaving and bundling several frames per payload also
   increases end-to-end delay and sets higher buffering requirements.
   Therefore, interleaving is not appropriate for all use cases or
   devices.  Streaming applications should most likely be able to
   exploit interleaving to improve audio quality in lossy transmission
   conditions.

   Note that this payload design supports the use of frame interleaving
   as an option.  The usage of this feature needs to be negotiated in
   the session setup.

   The interleaving supported by this format is rather flexible.  For
   example, a continuous pattern can be defined, as depicted in
   Figure 2.

   --+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--
     | f(n-2) | f(n-1) |  f(n)  | f(n+1) | f(n+2) | f(n+3) | f(n+4) |

              [ p(n)   ]
     [ p(n+1) ]                 [ p(n+1) ]
                       [ p(n+2) ]                 [ p(n+2) ]
                                         [ p(n+3) ]
                                                           [ p(n+4) ]

   Figure 2: An example of interleaving pattern that has constant delay

   In Figure 2, the consecutive frames, denoted f(n-2) to f(n+4), are
   aggregated into packets p(n) to p(n+4), each packet carrying two
   frames.  This approach provides an interleaving pattern that allows
   for constant delay in both the interleaving and de-interleaving
   processes.  The de-interleaving buffer needs to have room for at
   least three frames, including the one that is ready to be consumed.
   The storage space for three frames is needed, for example, when f(n)
   is the next frame to be decoded: since frame f(n) was received in
   packet p(n+2), which also carried frame f(n+3), both these frames are
   stored in the buffer.  Furthermore, frame f(n+1) received in the
   previous packet, p(n+1), is also in the de-interleaving buffer.  Note
   also that in this example the buffer occupancy varies: when frame
   f(n+1) is the next one to be decoded, there are only two frames,
   f(n+1) and f(n+3), in the buffer.

   The main purpose of the payload design for G.719 is to maximize the
   potential of the codec to its fullest degree with as minimal overhead
   as possible.  In the design, both basic and interleaved modes have




<span class="grey">Westerlund &amp; Johansson      Standards Track                     [Page 7]</span></pre>

   been included, as the codec is suitable both for conversational and
   other low-delay applications as well as streaming, where more delay
   is acceptable.

   The main structural difference between the basic and interleaved
   modes is the extension of the table of contents entries with frame
   displacement fields in the interleaved mode.  The basic mode supports
   aggregation of multiple consecutive frames in a payload.  The
   interleaved mode supports aggregation of multiple frames that are
   non-consecutive in time.  In both modes, it is possible to have
   frames encoded with different frame types in the same payload.

   The payload format also supports the usage of G.719 for carrying
   multi-channel content using one discrete encoder per channel all
   using the same bitrate.  In this case, a complete frame-block with
   data from all channels is included in the RTP payload.  The data is
   the concatenation of all the encoded audio frames in the order
   specified for that number of included channels.  Also, interleaving
   is done on complete frame-blocks rather than on individual audio
   frames.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20RTP%20Header%20Usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  RTP Header Usage</span>

   The RTP timestamp corresponds to the sampling instant of the first
   sample encoded for the first frame-block in the packet.  The
   timestamp clock frequency SHALL be 48000 Hz.  The timestamp is also
   used to recover the correct decoding order of the frame-blocks.

   The RTP header marker bit (M) SHALL be set to 1 whenever the first
   frame-block carried in the packet is the first frame-block in a
   talkspurt (see definition of the talkspurt in <a href="rfc3551.html#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of
   [RFC3551]</a>).  For all other packets, the marker bit SHALL be set to
   zero (M=0).

   The assignment of an RTP payload type for the format defined in this
   memo is outside the scope of this document.  The RTP profiles in use
   currently mandate binding the payload type dynamically for this
   payload format.  This is basically necessary because the payload type
   expresses the configuration of the payload itself, i.e., basic or
   interleaved mode, and the number of channels carried.

   The remaining RTP header fields are used as specified in [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].

      relative to the preceding frame-block in the payload, in units of
      20-ms long audio frame-blocks).  The 4-bit unsigned integer
      displacement values may be between zero and 15 indicating the
      number of audio frame-blocks in decoding order between the
      (i-1):th and the i:th frame in the payload.  Note that for the
      first ToC entry of the payload, the value of DIS1 is meaningless.
      It SHALL be set to zero by a sender and SHALL be ignored by a
      receiver.  This frame-block's location in the decoding order is
      uniquely defined by the RTP timestamp.  Note that for subsequent
      ToC entries DIS1 indicates the number of frames between the last
      frame of the previous group and the first frame of this group.

   Padd (4 bits):  To ensure octet alignment, 4 padding bits SHALL be
      included at the end of the ToC entry in case there is an odd
      number of frame-blocks in the group referenced by this ToC entry.
      These bits SHALL be set to zero and SHALL be ignored by the
      receiver.  If a group containing an even number of frames is
      referenced by this ToC entry, these padding bits SHALL NOT be
      included in the payload.

   The audio data part follows the table of contents.  All the octets
   comprising an audio frame SHALL be appended to the payload as a unit.
   For each frame-block, the audio frames are concatenated in the order
   indicated by the table in <a href="rfc3551.html#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of [RFC3551]</a> for the number of
   channels configured for the payload type in use.  So the first
   channel (leftmost) indicated comes first followed by the next
   channel.  The audio frame-blocks are packetized in increasing
   timestamp order within each group of frame-blocks (per ToC entry),
   i.e., oldest frame-block first.  The groups of frame-blocks are
   packetized in the same order as their corresponding ToC entries.

   The audio frames are specified in ITU recommendation [<a href="#ref-ITU-T-G719" title='"Specification : ITU-T G.719 extension for 20 kHz fullband audio"'>ITU-T-G719</a>].

   The G.719 bit stream is split into a sequence of octets and
   transmitted in order from the leftmost (most significant (MSB)) bit
   to the rightmost (least significant (LSB)) bit.

   An application implementing this payload format MUST understand all
   the payload parameters specified in this specification.  Any mapping
   of the parameters to a signaling protocol MUST support all
   parameters.  So an implementation of this payload format in an
   application using SDP is required to understand all the payload
   parameters in their SDP-mapped form.  This requirement ensures that
   an implementation always can decide whether it is capable of
   communicating when the communicating entities support this version of
   the specification.

   Basic mode SHALL be implemented and the interleaved mode SHOULD be
   implemented.  The implementation burden of both is rather small, and
   supporting both ensures interoperability.  However, interleaving is
   not mandated as it has limited applicability for conversational
   applications that require tight delay boundaries.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.6.1.%20%20Receiving%20Redundant%20Frames"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.6.1" name="section-5.6.1">5.6.1</a>.  Receiving Redundant Frames</span>

   The reception of redundant audio frames, i.e., more than one audio
   frame from the same source for the same time slot, MUST be supported
   by the implementation.  In the case that the receiver gets multiple
   audio frames in different bitrates for the same time slot, it is
   RECOMMENDED that the receiver keeps the one with the highest bitrate.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.6.2.%20%20Interleaving"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.6.2" name="section-5.6.2">5.6.2</a>.  Interleaving</span>

   The use of interleaving requires further considerations.  As
   presented in the example in <a href="#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</a>, a given interleaving
   pattern requires a certain amount of the de-interleaving buffer.
   This buffer space, expressed in a number of transport frame slots, is
   indicated by the "interleaving" media type parameter.  The number of
   frame slots needed can be converted into actual memory requirements
   by considering the 320 bytes per frame used by the highest bitrate of
   G.719.

   The information about the frame buffer size is not always sufficient
   to determine when it is appropriate to start consuming frames from
   the interleaving buffer.  Additional information is needed when the
   interleaving pattern changes.  The "int-delay" media type parameter
   is defined to convey this information.  It allows a sender to
   indicate the minimal media time that needs to be present in the
   buffer before the decoder can start consuming frames from the buffer.
   Because the sender has full control over the interleaving pattern, it
   can calculate this value.  In certain cases (for example, if joining
   a multicast session with interleaving mid-session), a receiver may
   initially receive only part of the packets in the interleaving

   pattern.  This initial partial reception (in frame sequence order) of
   frames can yield too few frames for acceptable quality from the audio
   decoding.  This problem also arises when using encryption for access
   control, and the receiver does not have the previous key.  Although
   the G.719 is robust and thus tolerant to a high random frame erasure
   rate, it would have difficulties handling consecutive frame losses at
   startup.  Thus, some special implementation considerations are
   described.

   In order to handle this type of startup efficiently, decoding can
   start provided that:

   1.  There are at least two consecutive frames available.

   2.  More than or equal to half the frames are available in the time
       period from where decoding was planned to start and the most
       forward received decoding.

   After receiving a number of packets, in the worst case as many
   packets as the interleaving pattern covers, the previously described
   effects disappear and normal decoding is resumed.  Similar issues
   arise when a receiver leaves a session or has lost access to the
   stream.  If the receiver leaves the session, this would be a minor
   issue since playout is normally stopped.  The sender can avoid this
   type of problem in many sessions by starting and ending interleaving
   patterns correctly when risks of losses occur.  One such example is a
   key-change done for access control to encrypted streams.  If only
   some keys are provided to clients and there is a risk they will
   receive content for which they do not have the key, it is recommended
   that interleaving patterns do not overlap key changes.

   If the receiver finds a mismatch between the size of a received
   payload and the size indicated by the ToC of the payload, the
   receiver SHOULD discard the packet.  This is recommended because
   decoding a frame parsed from a payload based on erroneous ToC data
   could severely degrade the audio quality.

   The second example is a payload consisting of 2 stereo frames that

      needed to avoid underrun in the de-interleaving buffer before
      starting decoding, i.e., the difference in RTP timestamp ticks
      between the earliest and latest audio frame present in the de-
      interleaving buffer expressed in milliseconds.  The value is a
      stream property and provided per source.  The allowed values are
      zero to the largest value expressible by an unsigned 16-bit
      integer (65535).  Please note that in practice, the largest value
      that can be used is equal to the declared size of the interleaving
      buffer of the receiver.  If the value for some reason is larger
      than the receiver buffer declared by or for the receiver, this
      value defaults to the size of the receiver buffer.  For sources
      for which this value hasn't been provided, the value defaults to
      the size of the receiver buffer.  The format is a comma-separated
      list of synchronization source (SSRC) ":" delay in ms pairs, which
      in ABNF [<a href="rfc5234.html" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>] is expressed as:

         int-delay = "int-delay:" source-delay *("," source-delay)

         source-delay = SSRC ":" delay-value

         SSRC = 1*8HEXDIG ; The 32-bit SSRC encoded in hex format

         delay-value = 1*5DIGIT ; The delay value in milliseconds

         Example: int-delay=ABCD1234:1000,4321DCB:640

         NOTE: No white space allowed in the parameter before the end of
         all the value pairs

   max-red:  The maximum duration in milliseconds that elapses between
      the primary (first) transmission of a frame and any redundant
      transmission that the sender will use.  This parameter allows a
      receiver to have a bounded delay when redundancy is used.  Allowed
      values are between zero (no redundancy will be used) and 65535.
      If the parameter is omitted, no limitation on the use of
      redundancy is present.

   channels:  The number of audio channels.  The possible values (1-6)
      and their respective channel order is specified in <a href="rfc3551.html#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of
      [RFC3551]</a>.  If omitted, it has the default value of 1.

   CBR:  Constant Bitrate (CBR) indicates the exact codec bitrate in
      bits per second (not including the overhead from packetization,
      RTP header, or lower layers) that the codec MUST use.  "CBR" is to
      be used when the dynamic rate cannot be supported (one case is,
      e.g., gateway to H.320).  "CBR" is mostly used for gateways to
      circuit switch networks.  Therefore, the "CBR" is the rate not
      including any FEC as specified in <a href="#section-4.3.1">Section 4.3.1</a>.  If FEC is to be
      used, the "b=" parameter MUST be used to allow the extra bitrate
      needed to send the redundant information.  It is RECOMMENDED that
      this parameter is only used when necessary to establish a working
      communication.  The usage of this parameter has implications for
      congestion control that need to be considered; see <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>.

   ptime:  see [<a href="rfc4566.html" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>].

   maxptime:  see [<a href="rfc4566.html" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>].

   Encoding considerations:  This media type is framed and binary; see

   Security considerations:  See <a href="rfc5404.html#section-10">Section 10 of RFC 5404</a>.

   Interoperability considerations:  The support of the Interleaving

   Change controller:  IETF Audio/Video Transport working group
      delegated from the IESG.

   Additionally, note that file storage of G.719-encoded audio in ISO
   base media file format is specified in Annex A of [<a href="#ref-ITU-T-G719" title='"Specification : ITU-T G.719 extension for 20 kHz fullband audio"'>ITU-T-G719</a>].
   Thus, media file formats such as MP4 (audio/mp4 or video/mp4)
   [<a href="rfc4337.html" title='"MIME Type Registration for MPEG-4"'>RFC4337</a>] and 3GP (audio/3GPP and video/3GPP) [<a href="rfc3839.html" title='"MIME Type Registrations for 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Multimedia files"'>RFC3839</a>] can contain
   G.719-encoded audio.

   The information carried in the media type specification has a
   specific mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [<a href="rfc4566.html" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>], which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP
   is used to specify sessions employing the G.719 codec, the mapping is
   as follows:

   o  The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The media subtype (payload format name) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as
      the encoding name.  The RTP clock rate in "a=rtpmap" MUST be
      48000, and the encoding parameter "channels" (<a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>) MUST
      either be explicitly set to N or omitted, implying a default value
      of 1.  The values of N that are allowed are specified in <a href="rfc3551.html#section-4.1">Section</a>
      <a href="rfc3551.html#section-4.1">4.1 in [RFC3551]</a>.

   o  The parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP "a=ptime" and
      "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively.

   o  Any remaining parameters go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
      copying them directly from the media type parameter string as a
      semicolon-separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   The following considerations apply when using SDP offer/answer
   procedures to negotiate the use of G.719 payload in RTP:

   o  Each combination of the RTP payload transport format configuration
      parameters ("interleaving" and "channels") is unique in its bit
      pattern and not compatible with any other combination.  When
      creating an offer in an application desiring to use the more
      advanced features (interleaving or more than one channel), the
      offerer is RECOMMENDED to also offer a payload type containing



<span class="grey">Westerlund &amp; Johansson      Standards Track                    [Page 19]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-20" id="page-20" name="page-20"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5404.html">RFC 5404</a>              RTP Payload Format for G.719          January 2009</span>


      only the configuration with a single channel.  If multiple
      configurations are of interest to the application, they may all be
      offered; however, care should be taken not to offer too many
      payload types.  An SDP answerer MUST include, in the SDP answer
      for a payload type, the following parameters unmodified from the
      SDP offer (unless it removes the payload type): "interleaving" and
      "channels".  However, the value of the "interleaving" parameter
      MAY be changed.  The SDP offerer and answerer MUST generate G.719
      packets as described by these parameters.

   o  The "interleaving" and "int-delay" parameters' values have a
      specific relationship that needs to be considered.  It also
      depends on the directionality of the streams and their delivery
      method.  The high-level explanation that can be understood from
      the definition is that the value of "interleaving" declares the
      size of the receiver buffer, while "int-delay" is a stream
      property provided by the sender to inform how much buffer space it
      in practice is using for the stream it sends.

      *  For media streams that are sent over multicast, the value of
         "interleaving" SHALL NOT be changed by the answerer.  It shall
         either be accepted or the payload type deleted.  The value of
         the "int-delay" parameter is a stream property and provided by
         the offer/answer agent that intends to send media with this
         payload type, and for each stream coming from that agent (one
         or more).  The value MUST be between zero and what corresponds
         to the buffer size declared by the value of the "interleaving"
         parameter.

      *  For unicast streams that the offerer declares as send-only, the
         value of the "interleaving" parameter is the size that the
         answerer is RECOMMENDED to use by the offerer.  The answerer
         MAY change it to any allowed value.  The "int-delay" parameter
         value will be the one the offerer intends to use unless the
         answerer reduces the value of the "interleaving" parameter
         below what is needed for that "int-delay" value.  If the
         "interleaving" value in the answer is smaller than the offer's
         "int-delay" value, the "int-delay" value is per default reduced
         to be corresponding to the "interleaving" value.  If the
         offerer is not satisfied with this, he will need to perform
         another round of offer/answer.  As the answerer will not send
         any media, it doesn't include any "int-delay" in the answer.

      *  For unicast streams that the offerer declares as recvonly, the
         value of "interleaving" in the offer will be the offerer's size
         of the interleaving buffer.  The answerer indicates its
         preferred size of the interleaving buffer for any future round
         of offer/answer.  The offerer will not provide any "int-delay"

         parameter as it is not sending any media.  The answerer is
         recommended to include in its answer an "int-delay" parameter
         to declare what the property is for the stream it is going to
         send.  The answer is expected to be capable of selecting a
         valid parameter value that is between zero and the declared
         maximum number of slots in the de-interleaving buffer.

      *  For unicast streams that the offer declares as sendrecv
         streams, the value of the "interleaving" parameter in the offer
         will be the offerer's size of the interleaving buffer.  The
         answerer will in the answer indicate the size of its actual
         interleaving buffer.  It is recommended that this value is at
         least as big as the offer's.  The offerer is recommended to
         include an "int-delay" parameter that is selected based on the
         answerer having at least as much interleaving space as the
         offerer unless nothing else is known.  As the offerer's
         interleaving buffer size is not yet known, this may fail, in
         which case the default rule is to downgrade the value of the
         "int-delay" to correspond to the full size of the answerer's
         interleaving buffer.  If the offerer isn't satisfied with this,
         it will need to initiate another round of offer/answer.  The
         answerer is recommended in its answer to include an "int-delay"
         parameter to declare what the property is for the stream(s) it
         is going to send.  The answer is expected to be capable of
         selecting a valid parameter value that is between zero and the
         declared maximum number of slots in the de-interleaving buffer.

   o  In most cases, the parameters "maxptime" and "ptime" will not
      affect interoperability; however, the setting of the parameters
      can affect the performance of the application.  The SDP offer/
      answer handling of the "ptime" parameter is described in
      [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>].  The "maxptime" parameter MUST be handled in the same
      way.

   o  The parameter "max-red" is a stream property parameter.  For
      sendonly or sendrecv unicast media streams, the parameter declares
      the limitation on redundancy that the stream sender will use.  For
      recvonly streams, it indicates the desired value for the stream
      sent to the receiver.  The answerer MAY change the value, but is
      RECOMMENDED to use the same limitation as the offer declares.  In
      the case of multicast, the offerer MAY declare a limitation; this
      SHALL be answered using the same value.  A media sender using this
      payload format is RECOMMENDED to always include the "max-red"
      parameter.  This information is likely to simplify the media
      stream handling in the receiver.  This is especially true if no
      redundancy will be used, in which case "max-red" is set to zero.

   o  Any unknown parameter in an offer SHALL be removed in the answer.

   o  The "b=" SDP parameter SHOULD be used to negotiate the maximum
      bandwidth to be used for the audio stream.  The offerer may offer
      a maximum rate and the answer may contain a lower rate.  If no
      "b=" parameter is present in the offer or answer, it implies a
      rate up to 128 kbps.

   o  The parameter "CBR" is a receiver capability; i.e., only receivers
      that really require a constant bitrate should use it.  Usage of
      this parameter has a negative impact on the possibility to perform
      congestion control; see <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>.  For recvonly and sendrecv
      streams, it indicates the desired constant bitrate that the
      receiver wants to accept.  A sender MUST be able to send a
      constant bitrate stream since it is a subset of the variable
      bitrate capability.  If the offer includes this parameter, the
      answerer MUST send G.719 audio at the constant bitrate if it is
      within the allowed session bitrate ("b=" parameter).  If the
      answerer cannot support the stated CBR, this payload type must be
      refused in the answer.  The answerer SHOULD only include this
      parameter if the answerer itself requires to receive at a constant
      bitrate, even if the offer did not include the "CBR" parameter.
      In this case, the offerer SHALL send at the constant bitrate, but
      SHALL be able to accept media at a variable bitrate.  An answerer
      is RECOMMEND to use the same CBR as in the offer, as symmetric
      usage is more likely to work.  If both sides require a particular
      CBR, there is the possibility of communication failure when one or
      both sides can't transmit the requested rate.  In this case, the
      agent detecting this issue will have to perform a second round of
      offer/answer to try to find another working configuration or end
      the established session.  In case the offer contained a "CBR"
      parameter but the answer does not, then the offerer is free to
      transmit at any rate to the answerer, but the answerer is
      restricted to the declared rate.

   In declarative usage, like SDP in the Real Time Streaming Protocol
   (RTSP) [<a href="rfc2326.html" title='"Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)"'>RFC2326</a>] or the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [<a href="rfc2974.html" title='"Session Announcement Protocol"'>RFC2974</a>], the parameters SHALL be interpreted as follows:

   o  The payload format configuration parameters ("interleaving" and
      "channels") are all declarative, and a participant MUST use the
      configuration(s) that is provided for the session.  More than one
      configuration may be provided if necessary by declaring multiple
      RTP payload types; however, the number of types should be kept
      small.

   o  It might not be possible to know the SSRC values that are going to
      be used by the sources at the time of sending the SDP.  This is
      not a major issue as the size of the interleaving buffer can be
      tailored towards the values that are actually going to be used,
      thus ensuring that the default values for "int-delay" are not
      resulting in too much extra buffering.

   o  Any "maxptime" and "ptime" values should be selected with care to
      ensure that the session's participants can achieve reasonable
      performance.

   o  The parameter "CBR" if included applies to all RTP streams using
      that payload type for which a particular CBR is declared.  Usage
      of this parameter has a negative impact on the possibility to
      perform congestion control; see <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>.

   One media type (audio/G719) has been defined and registered in the
   media types registry; see <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20%20Congestion%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>.  Congestion Control</span>

   The general congestion control considerations for transporting RTP
   data apply; see RTP [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and any applicable RTP profile like AVP
   [<a href="rfc3551.html" title='"RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control"'>RFC3551</a>].  However, the multi-rate capability of G.719 audio coding
   provides a mechanism that may help to control congestion, since the
   bandwidth demand can be adjusted (within the limits of the codec) by
   selecting a different encoding bitrate.

   The number of frames encapsulated in each RTP payload highly
   influences the overall bandwidth of the RTP stream due to header
   overhead constraints.  Packetizing more frames in each RTP payload
   can reduce the number of packets sent and hence the header overhead,
   at the expense of increased delay and reduced error robustness.  If
   forward error correction (FEC) is used, the amount of FEC-induced
   redundancy needs to be regulated such that the use of FEC itself does
   not cause a congestion problem.  In other words, a sender SHALL NOT
   increase the total bitrate when adding redundancy in response to
   packet loss, and needs instead to adjust it down in accordance to the
   congestion control algorithm being run.  Thus, when adding
   redundancy, the media bitrate will need to be reduced to provide room
   for the redundancy.

   The "CBR" signaling parameter allows a receiver to lock down an RTP
   payload type to use a single encoding rate.  As this prevents the
   codec rate from being lowered when congestion is experienced, the
   sender is constrained to either change the packetization or abort the

   transmission.  Since these responses to congestion are severely
   limited, implementations SHOULD NOT use the "CBR" parameter unless
   they are interacting with a device that cannot support a variable
   bitrate (e.g., a gateway to H.320 systems).  When using CBR mode, a
   receiver MUST monitor the packet loss rate to ensure congestion is
   not caused, following the guidelines in <a href="rfc3551.html#section-2">Section 2 of RFC 3551</a>.

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and in any applicable RTP profile.  The main
   security considerations for the RTP packet carrying the RTP payload
   format defined within this memo are confidentiality, integrity, and
   source authenticity.  Confidentiality is achieved by encryption of
   the RTP payload.  Integrity of the RTP packets is achieved through a
   suitable cryptographic integrity protection mechanism.  Such a
   cryptographic system may also allow the authentication of the source
   of the payload.  A suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload
   format should provide confidentiality, integrity protection, and at
   least source authentication capable of determining if an RTP packet
   is from a member of the RTP session.

   Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security to RTP and
   payloads following this memo may vary.  It is dependent on the
   application, the transport, and the signaling protocol employed.
   Therefore, a single mechanism is not sufficient, although if
   suitable, usage of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
   [<a href="rfc3711.html" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>] is recommended.  Other mechanisms that may be used are
   IPsec [<a href="rfc4301.html" title='"Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol"'>RFC4301</a>] and Transport Layer Security (TLS) [<a href="rfc5246.html" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>] (RTP
   over TCP); other alternatives may exist.

   The use of interleaving in conjunction with encryption can have a
   negative impact on confidentiality for a short period of time.
   Consider the following packets (in brackets) containing frame numbers
   as indicated: {10, 14, 18}, {13, 17, 21}, {16, 20, 24} (a popular
   continuous diagonal interleaving pattern).  The originator wishes to
   deny some participants the ability to hear material starting at time
   16.  Simply changing the key on the packet with the timestamp at or
   after 16, and denying that new key to those participants, does not
   achieve this; frames 17, 18, and 21 have been supplied in prior
   packets under the prior key, and error concealment may make the audio
   intelligible at least as far as frame 18 or 19, and possibly further.

   This RTP payload format and its media decoder do not exhibit any
   significant non-uniformity in the receiver-side computational
   complexity for packet processing, and thus are unlikely to pose a
   denial-of-service threat due to the receipt of pathological data.
   Nor does the RTP payload format contain any active content.
