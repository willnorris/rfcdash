   Many applications on mobile and embedded devices require continuous
   access to network communications so that real-time events -- such as
   incoming calls or messages -- can be delivered (or "pushed") in a
   timely fashion.  These devices typically have limited power reserves,
   so finding more efficient ways to serve application requirements
   greatly benefits the application ecosystem.

   One significant contributor to power usage is the radio.  Radio
   communications consume a significant portion of the energy budget on
   a wireless device.

   Uncoordinated use of persistent connections or sessions from multiple
   applications can contribute to unnecessary use of the device radio,
   since each independent session can incur its own overhead.  In
   particular, keep-alive traffic used to ensure that middleboxes do not
   prematurely time out sessions can result in significant waste.
   Maintenance traffic tends to dominate over the long term, since
   events are relatively rare.

   Consolidating all real-time events into a single session ensures more
   efficient use of network and radio resources.  A single service
   consolidates all events, distributing those events to applications as
   they arrive.  This requires just one session, avoiding duplicated
   overhead costs.

   The W3C Push API [<a href="#ref-API" title='"Push API"'>API</a>] describes an API that enables the use of a
   consolidated push service from web applications.  This document
   expands on that work by describing a protocol that can be used to:

   o  request the delivery of a push message to a user agent,

   o  create new push message delivery subscriptions, and

   o  monitor for new push messages.

   A standardized method of event delivery is particularly important for
   the W3C Push API, where application servers might need to use
   multiple push services.  The subscription, management, and monitoring
   functions are currently fulfilled by proprietary protocols; these are
   adequate, but do not offer any of the advantages that standardization
   affords.

   This document intentionally does not describe how a push service is
   discovered.  Discovery of push services is left for future efforts,
   if it turns out to be necessary at all.  User agents are expected to
   be configured with a URL for a push service.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   This document defines the following terms:

   application:  Both the sender and the ultimate consumer of push
      messages.  Many applications have components that are run on a
      user agent and other components that run on servers.

   application server:  The component of an application that usually
      runs on a server and requests the delivery of a push message.

   push message subscription:  A message delivery context that is
      established between the user agent and the push service, and
      shared with the application server.  All push messages are
      associated with a push message subscription.

   push message subscription set:  A message delivery context that is
      established between the user agent and the push service that
      collects multiple push message subscriptions into a set.

   push message:  A message sent from an application server to a user
      agent via a push service.

   push message receipt:  A message delivery confirmation sent from the
      push service to the application server.

   push service:  A service that delivers push messages to user agents.

   user agent:  A device and software that is the recipient of push
      messages.

   Examples in this document use the HTTP/1.1 message format [<a href="rfc7230.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>].
   Many of the exchanges can be completed using HTTP/1.1:

   o  Subscribing for Push Messages (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>)

   o  Requesting Push Message Delivery (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>)

   o  Replacing Push Messages (<a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>)

   o  Acknowledging Push Messages (<a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>)

   When an example depends on HTTP/2 server push, the more verbose frame
   format from [<a href="rfc7540.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)"'>RFC7540</a>] is used:

   o  Receiving Push Messages for a Subscription (<a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>)

   o  Receiving Push Messages for a Subscription Set (<a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>)

   o  Receiving Push Message Receipts (<a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>)

   All examples use HTTPS over the default port (443) rather than the
   registered port (1001).  A push service deployment might prefer this
   configuration to maximize chances for user agents to reach the
   service.  A push service might use HTTP alternative services to
   redirect a user agent to the registered port (1001) to gain the
   benefits of the standardized HTTPS port without sacrificing
   reachability (see <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>).  This would only be apparent in the
   examples through the inclusion of the Alt-Used header field [<a href="rfc7838.html" title='"HTTP Alternative Services"'>RFC7838</a>]
   in requests from the user agent to the push service.

   Examples do not include specific methods for push message encryption
   or application server authentication because the protocol does not
   define a mandatory system.  The examples in Voluntary Application
   Server Identification [<a href="#ref-VAPID" title='"Voluntary Application Server Identification for Web Push"'>VAPID</a>] and Message Encryption for WebPush
   [<a href="#ref-ENCRYPT" title='"Message Encryption for Web Push"'>ENCRYPT</a>] demonstrate the approach adopted by the W3C Push API [<a href="#ref-API" title='"Push API"'>API</a>]
   for its requirements.

   A general model for push services includes three basic actors: a user
   agent, a push service, and an application (server).

                      Figure 1: WebPush Architecture

   At the very beginning of the process, a new message subscription is
   created by the user agent and then distributed to its application
   server.  This subscription is the basis of all future interactions
   between the actors.  A subscription is used by the application server
   to send messages to the push service for delivery to the user agent.
   The user agent uses the subscription to monitor the push service for
   any incoming message.

   To offer more control for authorization, a message subscription is
   modeled as two resources with different capabilities:

   o  A subscription resource is used to receive messages from a
      subscription and to delete a subscription.  It is private to the
      user agent.

   o  A push resource is used to send messages to a subscription.  It is
      public and shared by the user agent with its application server.

   It is expected that a unique subscription will be distributed to each
   application; however, there are no inherent cardinality constraints
   in the protocol.  Multiple subscriptions might be created for the

   same application, or multiple applications could use the same
   subscription.  Note, however, that sharing subscriptions has security
   and privacy implications.

   Subscriptions have a limited lifetime.  They can also be terminated
   by either the push service or the user agent at any time.  User
   agents and application servers must be prepared to manage changes in
   the subscription state.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20HTTP%20Resources"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  HTTP Resources</span>

   This protocol uses HTTP resources [<a href="rfc7230.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>] and link relations
   [<a href="rfc5988.html" title='"Web Linking"'>RFC5988</a>].  The following resources are defined:

   push service:  This resource is used to create push message
      subscriptions (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>).  A URL for the push service is
      configured into user agents.

   push message subscription:  This resource provides read and delete
      access for a message subscription.  A user agent receives push
      messages (<a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>) using a push message subscription.  Every
      push message subscription has exactly one push resource associated
      with it.

   push message subscription set:  This resource provides read and
      delete access for a collection of push message subscriptions.  A
      user agent receives push messages (<a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>) for all the push
      message subscriptions in the set.  A link relation of type
      "urn:ietf:params:push:set" identifies a push message subscription
      set.

   push:  An application server requests the delivery (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>) of a
      push message using a push resource.  A link relation of type
      "urn:ietf:params:push" identifies a push resource.

   push message:  The push service creates a push message resource to
      identify push messages that have been accepted for delivery
      (<a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>).  The push message resource is also deleted by the
      user agent to acknowledge receipt (<a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>) of a push message.

   receipt subscription:  An application server receives delivery
      confirmations (<a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>) for push messages using a receipt
      subscription.  A link relation of type
      "urn:ietf:params:push:receipt" identifies a receipt subscription.

   The push service MUST use HTTP over Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [<a href="rfc2818.html" title='"HTTP Over TLS"'>RFC2818</a>] following the recommendations in [<a href="rfc7525.html" title='"Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)"'>RFC7525</a>].  The push
   service shares the same default port number (443/TCP) with HTTPS, but
   MAY also advertise the IANA-allocated TCP System Port (1001) using
   HTTP alternative services [<a href="rfc7838.html" title='"HTTP Alternative Services"'>RFC7838</a>].

   While the default port (443) offers broad reachability
   characteristics, it is most often used for web-browsing scenarios
   with a lower idle timeout than other ports configured in middleboxes.
   For WebPush scenarios, this would contribute to unnecessary radio
   communications to maintain the connection on battery-powered devices.

   Advertising the alternate port (1001) allows middleboxes to optimize
   idle timeouts for connections specific to push scenarios with the
   expectation that data exchange will be infrequent.

   Middleboxes SHOULD comply with REQ-5 in [<a href="rfc5382.html" title='"NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP"'>RFC5382</a>], which states that
   "the value of the 'established connection idle-timeout' MUST NOT be
   less than 2 hours 4 minutes".

   A user agent sends a POST request to its configured push service
   resource to create a new subscription.

   POST /subscribe HTTP/1.1
   Host: push.example.net

   A 201 (Created) response indicates that the push subscription was
   created.  A URI for the push message subscription resource that was
   created in response to the request MUST be returned in the Location
   header field.

   The push service MUST provide a URI for the push resource
   corresponding to the push message subscription in a link relation of
   type "urn:ietf:params:push".

   An application-specific method is used to distribute the push URI to
   the application server.  Confidentiality protection and application
   server authentication MUST be used to ensure that this URI is not
   disclosed to unauthorized recipients (<a href="#section-8.3">Section 8.3</a>).

   Collecting multiple push message subscriptions into a subscription
   set can represent a significant efficiency improvement for push
   services and user agents.  The push service MAY provide a URI for a
   subscription set resource in a link relation of type
   "urn:ietf:params:push:set".

   When a subscription set is returned in a push message subscription
   response, the user agent SHOULD include this subscription set in a
   link relation of type "urn:ietf:params:push:set" in subsequent
   requests to create new push message subscriptions.

   A user agent MAY omit the subscription set if it is unable to receive
   push messages in an aggregated way for the lifetime of the
   subscription.  This might be necessary if the user agent is
   monitoring subscriptions on behalf of other push message receivers.

   POST /subscribe HTTP/1.1

   MAY return a 429 (Too Many Requests) status code [<a href="rfc6585.html" title='"Additional HTTP Status Codes"'>RFC6585</a>] to reject
   requests that omit a subscription set.

   How a push service detects that requests originate from the same user
   agent is implementation-specific but could take ambient information
   into consideration, such as the TLS connection, source IP address,
   and port.  Implementers are reminded that some heuristics can produce
   false positives and hence, cause requests to be rejected incorrectly.

   An application server requests the delivery of a push message by
   sending an HTTP POST request to a push resource distributed to the
   application server by a user agent.  The content of the push message
   is included in the body of the request.

   For subsequent receipt requests to the same origin [<a href="rfc6454.html" title='"The Web Origin Concept"'>RFC6454</a>], the
   application server SHOULD include the returned receipt subscription
   in a link relation of type "urn:ietf:params:push:receipt".  This
   gives the push service the option to aggregate the receipts.  The
   push service SHOULD return the same receipt subscription in its

   unable to reuse the one provided by the application server.

   An application server MAY omit the receipt subscription if it is
   unable to receive receipts in an aggregated way for the lifetime of
   the receipt subscription.  This might be necessary if the application

   A push service can improve the reliability of push message delivery
   considerably by storing push messages for a period.  User agents are
   often only intermittently connected, and so benefit from having
   short-term message storage at the push service.

   Delaying delivery might also be used to batch communication with the
   user agent, thereby conserving radio resources.

   Some push messages are not useful once a certain period of time
   elapses.  Delivery of messages after they have ceased to be relevant
   is wasteful.  For example, if the push message contains a call
   notification, receiving a message after the caller has abandoned the

   call is of no value; the application at the user agent is forced to
   suppress the message so that it does not generate a useless alert.

   An application server MUST include the TTL (Time-To-Live) header
   field in its request for push message delivery.  The TTL header field
   contains a value in seconds that suggests how long a push message is
   retained by the push service.

   The TTL rule specifies a non-negative integer, representing time in
   seconds.  A recipient parsing and converting a TTL value to binary
   form SHOULD use an arithmetic type of at least 31 bits of non-
   negative integer range.  If a recipient receives a TTL value greater
   than the greatest integer it can represent, or if any of its
   subsequent calculations overflows, it MUST consider the value to be
   2147483648 (2^31).

   TTL = 1*DIGIT

   A push service MUST return a 400 (Bad Request) status code in
   response to requests that omit the TTL header field.

   A push service MAY retain a push message for a shorter duration than
   requested.  It indicates this by returning a TTL header field in its
   response with the actual TTL.  This TTL value MUST be less than or
   equal to the value provided by the application server.

   Once the TTL period elapses, the push service MUST NOT attempt to
   deliver the push message to the user agent.  A push service might
   adjust the TTL value to account for time accounting errors in
   processing.  For instance, distributing a push message within a
   server cluster might accrue errors due to clock skew or propagation
   delays.

   A push service is not obligated to account for time spent by the
   application server in sending a push message to the push service, or
   delays incurred while sending a push message to the user agent.  An
   application server needs to account for transit delays in selecting a
   TTL header field value.

   A Push message with a zero TTL is immediately delivered if the user
   agent is available to receive the message.  After delivery, the push
   service is permitted to immediately remove a push message with a zero
   TTL.  This might occur before the user agent acknowledges receipt of
   the message by performing an HTTP DELETE on the push message
   resource.  Consequently, an application server cannot rely on
   receiving acknowledgement receipts for zero TTL push messages.

   If the user agent is unavailable, a push message with a zero TTL
   expires and is never delivered.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.%20%20Push%20Message%20Urgency"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" name="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  Push Message Urgency</span>

   For a device that is battery-powered, it is often critical that it
   remains dormant for extended periods.  Radio communication in
   particular consumes significant power and limits the length of time
   that the device can operate.

   To avoid consuming resources to receive trivial messages, it is
   helpful if an application server can communicate the urgency of a
   message and if the user agent can request that the push server only
   forwards messages of a specific urgency.

   An application server MAY include an Urgency header field in its
   request for push message delivery.  This header field indicates the
   message urgency.  The push service MUST NOT forward the Urgency
   header field to the user agent.  A push message without the Urgency
   header field defaults to a value of "normal".

   A user agent MAY include the Urgency header field when monitoring for
   push messages to indicate the lowest urgency of push messages that it
   is willing to receive.  A push service MUST NOT deliver push messages
   with lower urgency than the value indicated by the user agent in its
   monitoring request.  Push messages of any urgency are delivered to a
   user agent that does not include an Urgency header field when
   monitoring for messages.

   The grammar for the Urgency header field is as follows:

   Urgency = urgency-option
   urgency-option = ("very-low" / "low" / "normal" / "high")

   In order of increasing urgency:

   +----------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
   | Urgency  | Device State                | Example Application      |
   |          |                             | Scenario                 |
   +----------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
   | very-low | On power and Wi-Fi          | Advertisements           |
   | low      | On either power or Wi-Fi    | Topic updates            |
   | normal   | On neither power nor Wi-Fi  | Chat or Calendar Message |
   | high     | Low battery                 | Incoming phone call or   |
   |          |                             | time-sensitive alert     |

   Multiple values for the Urgency header field MUST NOT be included in
   requests; otherwise, the push service MUST return a 400 (Bad Request)
   status code.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.4.%20%20Replacing%20Push%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.4" name="section-5.4">5.4</a>.  Replacing Push Messages</span>

   A push message that has been stored by the push service can be
   replaced with new content.  If the user agent is offline during the
   time that the push messages are sent, updating a push message avoids
   the situation where outdated or redundant messages are sent to the
   user agent.

   Only push messages that have been assigned a topic can be replaced.
   A push message with a topic replaces any outstanding push message
   with an identical topic.

   A push message topic is a string carried in a Topic header field.  A
   topic is used to correlate push messages sent to the same
   subscription and does not convey any other semantics.

   The grammar for the Topic header field uses the "token" rule defined
   in [<a href="rfc7230.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>].

   Topic = token

   For use with this protocol, the Topic header field MUST be restricted
   to no more than 32 characters from the URL and a filename-safe Base
   64 alphabet [<a href="rfc4648.html" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>RFC4648</a>].  A push service that receives a request with a
   Topic header field that does not meet these constraints MUST return a
   400 (Bad Request) status code to the application server.

   A push message replacement request creates a new push message
   resource and simultaneously deletes any existing message resource
   that has a matching topic.  If an attempt was made to deliver the
   deleted push message, an acknowledgment could arrive at the push
   service after the push message has been replaced.  Delivery receipts
   for such deleted messages SHOULD be suppressed.

   The replacement request also replaces the stored TTL, Urgency, and
   any receipt subscription associated with the previous message in the
   matching topic.

   A push message with a topic that is not shared by an outstanding
   message to the same subscription is stored or delivered as normal.

   For example, the following message could cause an existing message to
   be replaced:

   POST /push/JzLQ3raZJfFBR0aqvOMsLrt54w4rJUsV HTTP/1.1

   Topic: upd
   Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf8
   Content-Length: 36

   ZuHSZPKa2b1jtOKLGpWrcrn8cNqt0iVQyroF

   If the push service identifies an outstanding push message with a
   topic of "upd", then that message resource is deleted.  A 201
   (Created) response indicates that the push message replacement was
   accepted.  A URI for the new push message resource that was created
   in response to the request is included in the Location header field.

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Date: Thu, 11 Dec 2014 23:57:02 GMT
   Location: https://push.example.net/message/qDIYHNcfAIPP_5ITvURr-d6BGt

   The value of the Topic header field MUST NOT be forwarded to user
   agents.  Its value is neither encrypted nor authenticated.

   A user agent requests the delivery of new push messages by making a
   GET request to a push message subscription resource.  The push
   service does not respond to this request; instead, it uses HTTP/2
   server push [<a href="rfc7540.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)"'>RFC7540</a>] to send the contents of push messages as they
   are sent by application servers.

   A user agent MAY include an Urgency header field in its request.  The
   push service MUST NOT deliver messages with lower urgency than the
   value of the header field as defined in Table 1 (Illustrative Urgency
   Values).

   Each push message is pushed as the response to a synthesized GET
   request sent in a PUSH_PROMISE.  This GET request is made to the push
   message resource that was created by the push service when the
   application server requested message delivery.  The response headers
   SHOULD provide a URI for the push resource corresponding to the push
   message subscription in a link relation of type
   "urn:ietf:params:push".  The response body is the entity body from
   the most recent request sent to the push resource by the application
   server.

   the server push includes the push message.

   [<a href="rfc7240.html" title='"Prefer Header for HTTP"'>RFC7240</a>] with a "wait" preference set to "0".  In response to this
   request, the push service MUST generate a server push for all push

   A 204 (No Content) status code with no associated server pushes
   indicates that no messages are presently available.  This could be

   There are minor differences between receiving push messages for a
   subscription and a subscription set.  If a subscription set is
   available, the user agent SHOULD use the subscription set to monitor
   for push messages rather than individual push message subscriptions.

   A user agent requests the delivery of new push messages for a
   collection of push message subscriptions by making a GET request to a
   push message subscription set resource.  The push service does not
   respond to this request; instead, it uses HTTP/2 server push
   [<a href="rfc7540.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)"'>RFC7540</a>] to send the contents of push messages as they are sent by
   application servers.

   A user agent MAY include an Urgency header field in its request.  The
   push service MUST NOT deliver messages with lower urgency than the
   value of the header field as defined in Table 1 (Illustrative Urgency
   Values).

   Each push message is pushed as the response to a synthesized GET
   request sent in a PUSH_PROMISE.  This GET request is made to the push
   message resource that was created by the push service when the
   application server requested message delivery.  The synthetic request
   MUST provide a URI for the push resource corresponding to the push
   message subscription in a link relation of type
   "urn:ietf:params:push".  This enables the user agent to differentiate
   the source of the message.  The response body is the entity body from
   the most recent request sent to the push resource by an application
   server.

   The following example request is made over HTTP/2.

   HEADERS      [stream 7] +END_STREAM +END_HEADERS
     :method        = GET

   The push service permits the request to remain outstanding.  When a

   To ensure that a push message is properly delivered to the user agent
   at least once, the user agent MUST acknowledge receipt of the message
   by performing an HTTP DELETE on the push message resource.

   DELETE /message/qDIYHNcfAIPP_5ITvURr-d6BGt HTTP/1.1

   If the push service receives the acknowledgement and the application
   has requested a delivery receipt, the push service MUST return a 204
   (No Content) response to the application server monitoring the
   receipt subscription.

   If the push service does not receive the acknowledgement within a
   reasonable amount of time, then the message is considered to be not
   yet delivered.  The push service SHOULD continue to retry delivery of
   the message until its advertised expiration.

   The push service MAY cease to retry delivery of the message prior to
   its advertised expiration due to scenarios such as an unresponsive
   user agent or operational constraints.  If the application has

   subscription.

   The application server requests the delivery of receipts from the
   push service by making an HTTP GET request to the receipt
   subscription resource.  The push service does not respond to this
   request; instead, it uses HTTP/2 server push [<a href="rfc7540.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)"'>RFC7540</a>] to send push
   receipts when messages are acknowledged (<a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>) by the user
   agent.

   Each receipt is pushed as the response to a synthesized GET request
   sent in a PUSH_PROMISE.  This GET request is made to the same push
   message resource that was created by the push service when the
   application server requested message delivery.  The response includes
   a status code indicating the result of the message delivery and
   carries no data.

   The following example request is made over HTTP/2.

   HEADERS      [stream 13] +END_STREAM +END_HEADERS
     :method        = GET
     :path          = /receipt-subscription/3ZtI4YVNBnUUZhuoChl6omUvG4ZM
     :authority     = push.example.net

   The push service permits the request to remain outstanding.  When the
   user agent acknowledges the message, the push service pushes a
   delivery receipt to the application server.  A 204 (No Content)
   status code confirms that the message was delivered and acknowledged.

   PUSH_PROMISE [stream 13; promised stream 82] +END_HEADERS
     :method        = GET
     :path          = /message/qDIYHNcfAIPP_5ITvURr-d6BGt
     :authority     = push.example.net

   HEADERS      [stream 82] +END_STREAM

     :status        = 204
     date           = Thu, 11 Dec 2014 23:56:56 GMT

   If the user agent fails to acknowledge the receipt of the push
   message and the push service ceases to retry delivery of the message
   prior to its advertised expiration, then the push service MUST push a
   failure response with a status code of 410 (Gone).

   A push service is likely to have to maintain a very large number of
   open TCP connections.  Effective management of those connections can
   depend on being able to move connections between server instances.

   A user agent MUST support the 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code
   [<a href="rfc7231.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content"'>RFC7231</a>], which can be used by a push service to redistribute load
   at the time that a new subscription is requested.

   A server that wishes to redistribute load can do so using HTTP
   alternative services [<a href="rfc7838.html" title='"HTTP Alternative Services"'>RFC7838</a>].  HTTP alternative services allows for
   redistribution of load while maintaining the same URIs for various
   resources.  A user agent can ensure a graceful transition by using
   the GOAWAY frame once it has established a replacement connection.

   Storage of push messages based on the TTL header field comprises a
   potentially significant amount of storage for a push service.  A push
   service is not obligated to store messages indefinitely.  A push
   service is able to indicate how long it intends to retain a message
   to an application server using the TTL header field (<a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>).

   A user agent that does not actively monitor for push messages will
   not receive messages that expire during that interval.

   Push messages that are stored and have not been delivered to a user
   agent are delivered when the user agent recommences monitoring.
   Stored push messages SHOULD include a Last-Modified header field
   (<a href="rfc7232.html#section-2.2">SectionÂ 2.2 of [RFC7232]</a>) indicating when delivery was requested by
   an application server.

   A GET request to a push message subscription resource with only
   expired messages results in a response as though no push message was
   ever sent.

   Push services might need to limit the size and number of stored push
   messages to avoid overloading.  To limit the size of messages, the
   push service MAY return a 413 (Payload Too Large) status code
   [<a href="rfc7231.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content"'>RFC7231</a>] in response to requests that include an entity body that is
   too large.  Push services MUST NOT return a 413 status code in
   responses to an entity body that is 4096 bytes or less in size.

   To limit the number of stored push messages, the push service MAY
   respond with a shorter Time-To-Live than proposed by the application
   server in its request for push message delivery (<a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>).  Once
   a message has been accepted, the push service MAY later expire the

   failure response (<a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>).

   In some cases, it may be necessary to terminate subscriptions so that
   they can be refreshed.  This applies to both push message
   subscriptions and receipt subscriptions.

   A push service MAY expire a subscription at any time.  If there are
   outstanding requests to an expired push message subscription resource
   (<a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>) from a user agent or to an expired receipt subscription
   resource (<a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>) from an application server, this MUST be
   signaled by returning a 404 (Not Found) status code.

   A push service MUST return a 404 (Not Found) status code if an
   application server attempts to send a push message to an expired push
   message subscription.

   A user agent can remove its push message subscription by sending a
   DELETE request to the corresponding URI.  An application server can
   remove its receipt subscription by sending a DELETE request to the
   corresponding URI.

   A push service MAY expire a subscription set at any time and MUST
   also expire all push message subscriptions in the set.  If a user
   agent has an outstanding request to a push subscription set
   (<a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>), this MUST be signaled by returning a 404 (Not Found)
   status code.

   A user agent can request that a subscription set be removed by
   sending a DELETE request to the subscription set URI.  This MUST also
   remove all push message subscriptions in the set.

   If a specific push message subscription that is a member of a
   subscription set is expired or removed, then it MUST also be removed
   from its subscription set.

   A push service that does not support reliable delivery over
   intermittent network connections or failing applications on devices,
   forces the device to acknowledge receipt directly to the application
   server, incurring additional power drain in order to establish and
   maintain (usually secure) connections to the individual application
   servers.

   Push message reliability can be important if messages contain
   information critical to the state of an application.  Repairing the
   state can be expensive, particularly for devices with limited
   communications capacity.  Knowing that a push message has been
   correctly received avoids retransmissions, polling, and state
   resynchronization.

   The availability of push message delivery receipts ensures that the
   application developer is not tempted to create alternative mechanisms
   for message delivery in case the push service fails to deliver a
   critical message.  Setting up a polling mechanism or a backup
   messaging channel in order to compensate for these shortcomings
   negates almost all of the advantages a push service provides.

   However, reliability might not be necessary for messages that are
   transient (e.g., an incoming call) or messages that are quickly
   superseded (e.g., the current number of unread emails).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.5.%20%20Subscription%20Sets%20and%20Concurrent%20HTTP%2F2%20Streams"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.5" name="section-7.5">7.5</a>.  Subscription Sets and Concurrent HTTP/2 Streams</span>

   If the push service requires that the user agent use push message
   subscription sets, then it MAY limit the number of concurrently
   active streams with the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameter
   within an HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame [<a href="rfc7540.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)"'>RFC7540</a>].  The user agent MAY be
   limited to one concurrent stream to manage push message subscriptions
   and one concurrent stream for each subscription set returned by the
   push service.  This could force the user agent to serialize
   subscription requests to the push service.

   This protocol MUST use HTTP over TLS [<a href="rfc2818.html" title='"HTTP Over TLS"'>RFC2818</a>] following the
   recommendations in [<a href="rfc7525.html" title='"Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)"'>RFC7525</a>].  This includes any communications
   between the user agent and the push service, plus communications
   between the application server and the push service.  All URIs
   therefore use the "https" scheme.  This provides confidentiality and
   integrity protection for subscriptions and push messages from
   external parties.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1.%20%20Confidentiality%20from%20Push%20Service%20Access"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" name="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Confidentiality from Push Service Access</span>

   The protection afforded by TLS does not protect content from the push
   service.  Without additional safeguards, a push service can inspect
   and modify the message content.

   Applications using this protocol MUST use mechanisms that provide
   end-to-end confidentiality, integrity, and data origin
   authentication.  The application server sending the push message and
   the application on the user agent that receives it are frequently
   just different instances of the same application, so no standardized
   protocol is needed to establish a proper security context.  The
   distribution of subscription information from the user agent to its
   application server also offers a convenient medium for key agreement.

   For this requirement, the W3C Push API [<a href="#ref-API" title='"Push API"'>API</a>] has adopted Message
   Encryption for WebPush [<a href="#ref-ENCRYPT" title='"Message Encryption for Web Push"'>ENCRYPT</a>] to secure the content of messages
   from the push service.  Other scenarios can be addressed by similar
   policies.

   The Topic header field exposes information that allows more granular
   correlation of push messages on the same subject.  This might be used
   to aid traffic analysis of push messages by the push service.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.2.%20%20Privacy%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" name="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Privacy Considerations</span>

   Push message confidentiality does not ensure that the identity of who
   is communicating and when they are communicating is protected.
   However, the amount of information that is exposed can be limited.

   The URIs provided for push resources MUST NOT provide any basis to
   correlate communications for a given user agent.  It MUST NOT be
   possible to correlate any two push resource URIs based solely on
   their contents.  This allows a user agent to control correlation
   across different applications or over time.  Of course, this does not
   prevent correlation using other information that a user agent might
   expose.

   Similarly, the URIs provided by the push service to identify a push
   message MUST NOT provide any information that allows for correlation
   across subscriptions.  Push message URIs for the same subscription
   MAY contain information that would allow correlation with the
   associated subscription or other push messages for that subscription.

   User and device information MUST NOT be exposed through a push or
   push message URI.

   In addition, push URIs established by the same user agent or push
   message URIs for the same subscription MUST NOT include any
   information that allows them to be correlated with the user agent.

   Note:  This need not be perfect as long as the resulting anonymity
      set (<a href="rfc6973.html#section-6.1.1">[RFC6973], SectionÂ 6.1.1</a>) is sufficiently large.  A push URI
      necessarily identifies a push service or a single server instance.
      It is also possible that traffic analysis could be used to
      correlate subscriptions.

   A user agent MUST be able to create new subscriptions with new
   identifiers at any time.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.3.%20%20Authorization"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.3" name="section-8.3">8.3</a>.  Authorization</span>

   This protocol does not define how a push service establishes whether
   a user agent is permitted to create a subscription, or whether push
   messages can be delivered to the user agent.  A push service MAY
   choose to authorize requests based on any HTTP-compatible
   authorization method available, of which there are multiple options
   (including experimental options) with varying levels of security.
   The authorization process and any associated credentials are expected
   to be configured in the user agent along with the URI for the push
   service.

   Authorization is managed using capability URLs for the push message
   subscription, push, and receipt subscription resources ([<a href="#ref-CAP-URI" title='"Good Practices for Capability URLs"'>CAP-URI</a>]).
   A capability URL grants access to a resource based solely on
   knowledge of the URL.

   Capability URLs are used for their "easy onward sharing" and "easy
   client API" properties.  These properties make it possible to avoid
   relying on prearranged relationships or additional protocols between
   push services and application servers.

   Capability URLs act as bearer tokens.  Knowledge of a push message
   subscription URI implies authorization to either receive push
   messages or delete the subscription.  Knowledge of a push URI implies
   authorization to send push messages.  Knowledge of a push message URI
   allows for reading and acknowledging that specific message.
   Knowledge of a receipt subscription URI implies authorization to
   receive push receipts.

   Encoding a large amount of random entropy (at least 120 bits) in the
   path component ensures that it is difficult to successfully guess a
   valid capability URL.

   A user agent can control where valid push messages originate by
   limiting the distribution of push URIs to authorized application
   servers.  Ensuring that push URIs are hard to guess ensures that only
   application servers that have received a push URI can use it.

   Push messages that are not successfully authenticated by the user
   agent will not be delivered, but this can present a denial-of-service
   risk.  Even a relatively small volume of push messages can cause
   battery-powered devices to exhaust power reserves.

   To address this case, the W3C Push API [<a href="#ref-API" title='"Push API"'>API</a>] has adopted Voluntary
   Application Server Identification [<a href="#ref-VAPID" title='"Voluntary Application Server Identification for Web Push"'>VAPID</a>], which allows a user agent
   to restrict a subscription to a specific application server.  The
   push service can then identify and reject unwanted messages without
   contacting the user agent.

   A malicious application with a valid push URI could use the greater
   resources of a push service to mount a denial-of-service attack on a
   user agent.  Push services SHOULD limit the rate at which push
   messages are sent to individual user agents.

   A push service MAY return a 429 (Too Many Requests) status code
   [<a href="rfc6585.html" title='"Additional HTTP Status Codes"'>RFC6585</a>] when an application server has exceeded its rate limit for
   push message delivery to a push resource.  The push service SHOULD
   also include a Retry-After header [<a href="rfc7231.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content"'>RFC7231</a>] to indicate how long the
   application server is requested to wait before it makes another
   request to the push resource.

   A push service or user agent MAY also terminate subscriptions
   (<a href="#section-7.3">Section 7.3</a>) that receive too many push messages.

   A push service is also able to deny service to user agents.
   Intentional failure to deliver messages is difficult to distinguish
   from faults, which might occur due to transient network errors,
   interruptions in user agent availability, or genuine service outages.

   Server request logs can reveal subscription-related URIs or
   relationships between subscription-related URIs for the same user
   agent.  Limitations on log retention and strong access control
   mechanisms can ensure that URIs are not revealed to unauthorized
   entities.
