   This document describes an extension to the Internet Printing
   Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics [<a href="rfc2911.html">RFC 2911</a>], [<a href="rfc2910.html">RFC 2910</a>].  This
   document specifies the 'ippget' Pull Delivery Method for use with the
   "Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and
   Subscriptions" specification [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>].  This IPPGET Delivery Method
   is REQUIRED for all clients and Printers that support [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>].  The
   Notification Recipient, acting as a client, fetches (pulls) Event
   Notifications by using the Get-Notifications operation defined in
   this document.  For a description of the base IPP documents, see
   <a href="#section-21">section 21</a> of this document.  For a description of the IPP Event
   Notification Model, see [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>].

   With this Pull Delivery Method, when an Event occurs, the Printer
   saves the Event Notification for a period of time called the Event
   Life.  The Notification Recipient fetches (pulls) the Event
   Notifications by using the Get-Notifications operation.  This
   operation causes the Printer to return all Event Notifications held
   for the specified Subscription object(s).  If the Notification
   Recipient has selected the Event Wait Mode option to wait for
   additional Event Notifications, the Printer MAY continue to return
   Event Notifications to the Notification Recipient as asynchronous
   Get-Notification responses as Events occur using the transaction
   originated by the Notification Recipient.

   The Notification Recipient can terminate Event Wait Mode (without
   closing the connection) by supplying the "notify-wait" (boolean)
   attribute with a 'false' value in a subsequent Get-Notifications
   request.  Similarly, the Printer can terminate Event Wait Mode
   (without closing the connection) by returning the "notify-get-
   interval" (integer) operation attribute in a Get-Notifications
   response that tells the Notification Recipient how long to wait
   before trying again.

   Capitalized terms such as MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD
   NOT, MAY, NEED NOT, and OPTIONAL have special meaning relating to
   conformance as defined in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] and <a href="rfc2911.html#section-12.1">[RFC2911], section 12.1</a>.  If
   an implementation supports the extension defined in this document,
   then these terms apply; otherwise, they do not.  These terms define
   conformance to this document only; they do not affect conformance to
   other documents, unless it is explicitly stated otherwise.

   This document uses the same terminology as [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>], including
   "client", "Printer", "Job", "attribute", "attribute value",
   "keyword", "operation", "request", "response", and "support", with
   the same meanings.  This document also uses terminology defined in
   [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>], such as "Subscription (object)", "Notification Recipient",
   "Event", "Event Notification", "Compound Event Notification", "Event
   Life", and "Event Notification Attribute Group", with the same
   meanings.  In addition, this document defines the following terms for
   use in this document:

   Event Wait Mode: The mode requested by a Notification Recipient
       client in its Get-Notifications Request and granted by a Printer
       to keep the connection open while the Printer sends subsequent
       Get-Notification operation responses to the Notification
       Recipient in the form of Event Notifications as they occur.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Model%20and%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Model and Operation</span>

   In a Subscription Creation Operation, when the "notify-pull-method"
   attribute is present and has the "ippget" keyword value, the client
   is requesting that the Printer use the "ippget" Pull Delivery Method
   for the Event Notifications associated with the new Subscription
   Object.

   When an Event occurs, the Printer MUST generate an Event Notification
   and MUST assign it the Event Life.  The Printer MUST hold an Event
   Notification for its assigned Event Life.

   When a Notification Recipient wants to receive Event Notifications
   for a Subscription object, it performs the Get-Notifications
   operation supplying the Subscription object's subscription-id, which
   causes the Printer to return all un-expired Event Notifications held
   for that Subscription object.  If the Notification Recipient has
   selected the Event Wait Mode option to wait for additional Event
   Notifications, the response to the Get-Notifications request
   continues indefinitely as the Printer continues to send Event

   Notifications in the response as Events occur for that Subscription
   object.

   When the Notification Recipient requests Event Notifications for
   Per-Job Subscription Objects, the Notification Recipient typically
   performs the Get-Notifications operation within a second of
   performing the Subscription Creation operation.  Because the Printer
   MUST save Event Notifications for at least 15 seconds (see <a href="#section-8.1">section</a>
   <a href="#section-8.1">8.1</a>), the Notification Recipient is unlikely to miss any Event
   Notifications that occur between the Subscription Creation and the
   Get-Notifications operation.

   The 'ippget' Delivery Method is designed primarily for (1) a client
   that wants to get Events (from the job's Per-Job Subscription object)
   for a job that it has submitted and (2) a privileged client that
   wants to get all job or printer Events from a Per-Printer
   Subscription object.

   This operation is issued by a client acting in the role of a
   Notification Recipient requesting the Printer to return all Event
   Notifications held for the identified Subscription object(s).

   A Printer MUST support this operation, MUST accept the request in any
   state (see [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>] "printer-state" and "printer-state-reasons"
   attributes), and MUST remain in the same state with the same
   "printer-state-reasons" values.

   When a Printer performs this operation, it MUST return all and only
   those Event Notifications

   1.  whose associated Subscription Object's "notify-subscription-id"
       Subscription Description attribute equals one of the values of
       the "notify-subscription-ids" (1setOf integer(1:MAX)) operation
       attribute AND

   2.  whose associated Subscription Object contains the "notify-pull-
       method" attribute and it has the 'ippget' keyword value, AND

   3.  whose "notify-sequence-number" is equal to or greater than the
       corresponding value of the "notify-sequence-numbers" (1setOf
       integer(1:MAX)) operation attribute if supplied AND

   4.  whose Event Life has not yet expired AND

   5.  where the Notification Recipient client has read-access rights to
       the identified Subscription Object (see Access Rights paragraph
       below).

   The Notification Recipient client MUST either (a) request Event Wait
   Mode by supplying the "notify-wait" operation attribute with a 'true'
   value or (b) suppress Event Wait Mode by omitting the "notify-wait"
   operation attribute or by supplying it with a 'false' value.  To
   terminate Event Wait Mode subsequently, the Notification Recipient
   client MUST close the connection.  To terminate Event Wait Mode, the
   Printer MUST either (a) return the "notify-get-interval" operation

   attribute in a Get-Notifications response (RECOMMENDED behavior) or
   (b) close the connection.  The "notify-get-interval" operation
   attributes tell the Notification Recipient how long to wait before
   trying a subsequent Get-Notifications request.

   Access Rights: The authenticated user (see <a href="rfc2911.html#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section 8.3</a>)
   performing this operation MUST be (1) the owner of each Subscription
   Object identified by the "notify-subscription-ids" operation
   attribute (see <a href="#section-5.1.1">section 5.1.1</a>), (2) an operator or administrator of
   the Printer (see [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>], sections <a href="#section-1">1</a> and <a href="#section-8.5">8.5</a>), or (3) otherwise
   authorized by the Printer's administrator-configured security policy
   to request Event Notifications from the target Subscription
   Object(s).  Otherwise, the IPP Printer MUST reject the operation and
   return: 'client-error-forbidden', 'client-error-not-authenticated',
   or 'client-error-not-authorized' status code, as appropriate.
   Furthermore, the Printer's security policy MAY limit the attributes
   returned by the Get-Notifications operation, in a manner similar to
   that of the Get-Job-Attributes operation (see [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>], end of
   <a href="#section-3.3.4.2">section 3.3.4.2</a>).

   The following groups of attributes are part of the Get-Notifications
   Request:

   Group 1: Operation Attributes

      Natural Language and Character Set:
         The "attributes-charset" and "attributes-natural-language"
         attributes, as described in <a href="rfc2911.html#section-3.1.4.1">[RFC2911], section 3.1.4.1</a>.

      Target:
         The "printer-uri" (uri) operation attribute that is the target
         for this operation as described in <a href="rfc2911.html#section-3.1.5">[RFC2911], section 3.1.5</a>.

      Requesting User Name:
         The "requesting-user-name" (name(MAX)) attribute SHOULD be
         supplied by the client as described in <a href="rfc2911.html#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section 8.3</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.1.%20%20notify-subscription-ids%20%281setOf%20integer%281%3AMAX%29%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.1" name="section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a>.  notify-subscription-ids (1setOf integer(1:MAX))</span>

   This attribute identifies one or more Subscription objects for which
   Events are requested.  The client MUST supply this attribute with at
   least one value.  The Printer object MUST support this attribute with
   multiple values.

   If no Subscription Object exists with the supplied identifier, or if
   the identified Subscription Object does not contain the "notify-

   pull-method" attribute with the 'ippget' keyword value, the Printer
   MUST return the 'client-error-not-found' status code.

         Note:  The name of both the "notify-subscription-ids" and
         "notify-sequence-numbers" end in 's', as they are multi-valued.
         However, there are other occurrences of these attribute names
         without the 's' that are single valued.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.2.%20%20notify-sequence-numbers%20%281setOf%20integer%281%3AMAX%29%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.2" name="section-5.1.2">5.1.2</a>.  notify-sequence-numbers (1setOf integer(1:MAX))</span>

   This attribute specifies one or more of the lowest Event Notification
   sequence number values for the Subscription objects identified by the
   corresponding values of the "notify-subscription-ids" operation
   attribute.  The Notification Recipient SHOULD supply this attribute,
   and the number of values SHOULD be the same as that of the "notify-
   subscriptions-ids" attribute.  The Printer MUST support this
   attribute with multiple values.

   The Printer MUST NOT return Notification Events with lower sequence
   numbers for the corresponding Subscription object.  Therefore, by
   supplying the proper values for this attribute the Notification
   Recipient can prevent getting the same Event Notifications from a
   Subscription object that were returned on a previous Get-
   Notifications request.  The Notification Recipient SHOULD remember
   the highest "notify-sequence-number" value returned for each
   Subscription object requested and SHOULD pass that value for each
   requested Subscription object on the next Get-Notifications request.

   If the Notification Recipient supplies fewer values for this
   attribute (including omitting this attribute) than it does for the
   "notify-subscription-ids" operation attribute, the Printer assumes a
   '1' value for each missing value.  A value of '1' causes the Printer
   to return any un-expired Event Notification for that Subscription
   object, as '1' is the lowest possible sequence number.  If the
   Notification Recipient supplies more values for this attribute than
   the number of values for the "notify-subscription-ids" operation
   attribute, the Printer ignores the extra values.

   Note: If a Notification Recipient performs two consecutive Get-
   Notifications operations with the same value for "notify-sequence-
   number" (or omits the attribute), the time stamp value of the first
   Event Notification in the second Get-Notifications Response may be
   less than that of the time stamp of the last Event Notification in
   the first Get-Notification Response.  This happens because the
   Printer sends all unexpired Event Notifications with an equal or
   higher sequence number according to the ordering specified in
   [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>], and some Event Notifications from the first Get-

   This value indicates whether the Notification Recipient wants Event
   Wait Mode.  The client MAY supply this attribute.  The Printer object
   MUST support both values of this attribute.

   If the client supplies the 'false' value or omits this attribute, the
   client is not requesting Event Wait Mode.  If the value is 'true',
   the client is requesting Event Wait Mode.  See the beginning of

   The Printer has the following options for responding to a Get-
   Notifications Request:

   1.  The Printer can reject the request and return the 'server-error-
       busy' status code if the Printer is too busy to accept this
       operation at this time.  In this case, the Printer MUST return
       the "get-notify-interval" operation attribute to indicate when
       the client SHOULD try again.

   2.  If the Notification Recipient did not request Event Wait Mode
       ("notify-wait-mode" = 'false' or omitted), the Printer MUST
       immediately return whatever Event Notifications it currently
       holds in the requested Subscription object(s) and MUST return the
       "notify-get-interval" operation attribute with the number of
       seconds from now, at which the Notification Recipient SHOULD
       repeat the Get-Notifications Request to get future Event
       Notifications.

   3.  If the Notification Recipient requested Event Wait Mode
       ("notify-wait-mode" = 'true'), the Printer MUST immediately
       return whatever Event Notifications it currently holds in the
       requested Subscription object(s) and MUST continue to return
       Event Notifications as they occur until all the requested
       Subscription Objects are canceled.  A Subscription Object is
       canceled either via the Cancel-Subscription operation or by the
       Printer (e.g., the Subscription Object is canceled when the
       associated Job completes and is no longer in the Job Retention or
       Job History phase; see the "ippget-event-life (integer(15:MAX))"
       attribute discussion in <a href="#section-8.1">section 8.1</a>).

       However, the Printer MAY decide to terminate Event Wait Mode at
       any time, including in the first response.  In this case, the

       Printer MUST return the "notify-get-interval" operation
       attribute.  This attribute indicates that the Printer wishes to
       leave Event Wait Mode and the number of seconds in the future
       that the Notification Recipient SHOULD try the Get-Notifications
       operation again.  The Notification Recipient MUST accept this
       response and MUST disconnect.  If the Notification Recipient does
       not disconnect, the Printer SHOULD do so.

   From the Notification Recipient's view, the response appears as an
   initial burst of data, which includes the Operation Attributes Group
   and one Event Notification Attributes Group per Event Notification
   that the Printer is holding.  After the initial burst of data, if the
   Notification Recipient has selected the Event Wait Mode option to
   wait for additional Event Notifications, the Notification Recipient
   receives occasional Event Notification Attribute Groups.  Proxy
   servers may delay some Event Notifications or cause time-outs to
   occur.  The client MUST be prepared to perform the Get-Notifications
   operation again when time-outs occur.

   Each attribute is encoded by using the IPP rules for encoding
   attributes [<a href="rfc2910.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport"'>RFC2910</a>] and MAY be encoded in any order.  Note:  the
   Get-Jobs response in [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>] acts as a model for encoding multiple
   groups of attributes.  See <a href="#section-11">section 11</a> for the encoding and transport
   rules.

   The following groups of attributes are part of the Get-Notifications
   Response:

   Group 1: Operation Attributes

      Status Message:  In addition to the REQUIRED status code returned
         in every response, the response OPTIONALLY includes a "status-
         message" (text(255)) and/or a "detailed-status-message"
         (text(MAX)) operation attribute, as described in [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>],
         sections <a href="#section-13">13</a> and <a href="#section-3.1.6">3.1.6</a>.

         The Printer can return any status codes defined in [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>].
         If the status code is not 'successful-xxx', the Printer MUST
         NOT return any Event Notification Attribute groups.  The
         following are descriptions of the important status codes:

            successful-ok: The response contains all Event Notification
               associated with the specified subscription-ids that had
               been supplied in the "notify-subscription-ids" operation
               attribute in the request.  If the requested Subscription
               Objects have no associated Event Notification, the
               response MUST contain zero Event Notifications.

            successful-ok-events-complete:  Indicates when this return
               is the last return for all Subscription objects that
               match the request, whether or not Event Notifications are
               returned.  This condition occurs for Event Wait Mode with
               Notification Recipients waiting for responses when (1)
               the Subscription Object is canceled with a Cancel-
               Subscription operation, (2) the Subscription Object is
               deleted, when the Per-Printer Subscription lease time
               expires, or (3) the 'job-completed' event occurs for a
               Per-Job Subscription.  This condition also occurs for a
               Get-Notifications request that a Notification Recipient
               makes after the job completes, but before the Event Life
               expires.  See <a href="#section-10.1">section 10.1</a>.
            client-error-not-found: The Printer has no Subscription
               Objects whose "notify-subscription-id" attribute equals
               any of the values of the "notify-subscription-ids"
               operation attribute supplied, or the identified
               Subscription Object does not contain the "notify-pull-
               method" attribute with the 'ippget' keyword value.
            server-error-busy: The Printer is too busy to accept this
               operation.  The Printer SHOULD return the "notify-get-
               interval" operation attribute in the Operation Attributes
               of the response; then the Notification Recipient SHOULD
               wait for the number of seconds specified by the "notify-
               get-interval" operation attribute before performing this
               operation again.  If the "notify-get-interval" Operation
               Attribute is not present, the Notification Recipient
               SHOULD use the normal network back-off algorithms to
               determine when to perform this operation again.

      Natural Language and Character Set:
         The "attributes-charset" and "attributes-natural-language"
         attributes, as described in <a href="rfc2911.html#section-3.1.4.2">[RFC2911], section 3.1.4.2</a>.

         The Printer MUST use the values of "notify-charset" and
         "notify-natural-language", respectively, from one Subscription
         Object associated with the Event Notifications in this
         response.

         Normally, there is only one matched Subscription Object, or the
         value of the "notify-charset" and "notify-natural-language"
         attributes is the same in all Subscription Objects.  If not,
         the Printer MUST pick one Subscription Object from which to
         obtain the value of these attributes.  The algorithm for
         picking the Subscription Object is implementation dependent.
         The choice of natural language is not critical, because 'text'
         and 'name' values can override the "attributes-natural-
         language" operation attribute.  The Printer's choice of charset



<span class="grey">Herriot, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 12]</span></pre>

         is critical because a bad choice may leave it unable to send
         some 'text' and 'name' values accurately.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.1.%20%20notify-get-interval%20%28integer%280%3AMAX%29%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.1" name="section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a>.  notify-get-interval (integer(0:MAX))</span>

   The value of this operation attribute is the number of seconds that
   the Notification Recipient SHOULD wait before trying the Get-
   Notifications operation again.  The Printer MUST return this
   operation attribute if (1) it is too busy to return events, (2) the
   Notification Recipient client did not request Event Wait Mode, or (3)
   the Printer is terminating Event Wait Mode.  The client MUST accept
   this attribute and SHOULD reissue the Get-Notifications operation
   (with or without "notify-wait" = 'true') at the indicated number of
   seconds in the future in order to get more Event Notifications  This
   value is intended to help the client be a good network citizen.

   The value of this attribute MUST be at least as large as that of the
   Printer's "ippget-event-life" Printer Description attribute (see
   <a href="#section-8.1">section 8.1</a>).  The Printer MAY return a value that is larger than
   that of the "ippget-event-life" Printer Description attribute
   provided that the Printer increases the Event Life for this
   Subscription object so that Notification Recipients taking account of
   the larger value and polling with a longer interval will not miss
   events.  Note:  Implementing such an algorithm requires some hidden
   attributes in the Subscription object that are IMPLEMENTATION
   DEPENDENT.

   If the Printer wants to remain in Event Wait Mode, then the Printer
   MUST NOT return this attribute in the response.

   Here is a complete table of combinations of "notify-wait", "status-
   code", "notify-get-interval", and Event Notification Attributes
   Groups for Get-Notification initial (Wait and No Wait) Responses and
   subsequent Event Wait Mode Responses (which may stay in Event Wait
   Mode or may request the Notification Recipient to leave Event Wait

         * 'false' or client omits the "notify-wait" attribute.

         Explanation:

         1-4:  Client does not request Event Wait Mode.
         5-9:  Client requests Event Wait Mode.
         2,7:  Subscription object not found, or was canceled earlier;
               client should NOT try again.
         3,8:  Server busy, tells client to try later; client should try
               again in N seconds.
         4:    Client polled after job completed, but before Event Life
               expired, and got the 'job-completed' event, so the client
               shouldn't bother trying again; client should NOT try
               again later.
         5:    Printer returns one or more Event Notifications and is OK
               to stay in Event Wait Mode; the client waits for more
               Event Notifications to be returned.
         6:    Printer wants to leave Event Wait mode.  Can happen on
               the first response (with or without Event Notifications)
               or happen on a subsequent response with or without Event
               Notifications; the client SHOULD try again in N seconds.
         9:    Either (1) the printer returns 'job-completed' event, or
               (2) the Subscription Object was canceled by either a
               Cancel-Job or a Per-Printer Subscription expired without
               being renewed.  For case (1), at least one Event
               Notification MUST be returned; for case (2), it is
               unlikely that any Event Notifications are returned, and
               the client should NOT try again.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.2.%20%20printer-up-time%20%28integer%281%3AMAX%29%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.2" name="section-5.2.2">5.2.2</a>.  printer-up-time (integer(1:MAX))</span>

   The value of this attribute is the Printer's "printer-up-time"
   attribute at the time when the Printer sends this response.  The
   Printer MUST return this attribute.  Because each Event Notification
   also contains the value of this attribute when the event occurred,
   the value of this attribute lets a Notification Recipient know when
   each Event Notification occurred relative to the time of this
   response.

   Group 2: Unsupported Attributes
         See <a href="rfc2911.html#section-3.1.7">[RFC2911], section 3.1.7</a>, for details on returning
         Unsupported Attributes.

   Group 3 through N: Event Notification Attributes
         The Printer responds with one Event Notification Attributes
         Group per matched Event Notification.  The entire response is
         considered a single Compound Event Notification (see
         [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>]).  The matched Event Notifications are all un-expired
         Event Notifications associated with the matched Subscription
         Objects and MUST follow the "Event Notification Ordering"
         requirements for Event Notifications within a Compound Event
         Notification specified in <a href="rfc3995.html#section-9">[RFC3995] section 9</a>.  In other words,
         the Printer MUST order these Event Notification groups in
         ascending time stamp (and sequence number) order for a
         Subscription object.  If Event Notifications for multiple
         Subscription objects are being returned, the Notification
         Events for the next Subscription object follow in ascending
         time stamp order, etc.

         Each Event Notification Group MUST contain all of attributes
         specified in <a href="#section-9.1">section 9.1</a> ("Content of Machine Consumable Event
         Notifications") of [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>], with exceptions denoted by
         asterisks in the tables below.

         The tables below are identical to those in <a href="#section-9.1">section 9.1</a>
         ("Content of Machine Consumable Event Notifications") of
         [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>], except that each cell in the "Sends" column is a
         "MUST".

         If more than one Event Notification is being returned and the
         status of each is not the same, then the Printer MUST return a
         "notify-status-code" attribute in each Event Notification
         Attributes group to indicate the differing status values.

         For an Event Notification for all Events, the Printer includes
         the attributes shown in Table 3.

      which the Event Notification was sent.

      ** The Printer MUST send the "printer-current-time" attribute

   The 'ippget' Delivery Method does not define any addition
   Subscription Template attributes and has the conformance requirements
   for Subscription Template attributes defined in [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>].  This

   This Subscription Template attribute identifies the Pull Delivery
   Method to be used for the Subscription Object (see [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>]).  To
   support the 'ippget' Pull Delivery Method defined in this document,
   the Printer MUST support this attribute with the following keyword
   value:

     'ippget':  Indicates that the 'ippget' Pull Delivery Method is to
       be used for this Subscription Object.

   The 'ippget' Delivery Method has the conformance requirements for
   Subscription Description attributes defined in [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>].  The
   'ippget' Delivery Method does not define any addition Subscription
   Description attributes.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.%20%20Additional%20Printer%20Description%20Attributes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" name="section-8">8</a>.  Additional Printer Description Attributes</span>

   This section defines additional Printer Description attributes for
   use with the 'ippget' Delivery Method.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1.%20%20ippget-event-life%20%28integer%2815%3AMAX%29%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1" name="section-8.1">8.1</a>.  ippget-event-life (integer(15:MAX))</span>

   This Printer Description attribute specifies the Event Life value
   that the Printer assigns to each Event; i.e., the number of seconds
   after an Event occurs during which a Printer will return that Event
   in an Event Notification in a Get-Notifications response.  After the
   Event Life expires for the Event, the Printer MAY no longer return an
   Event Notification for that Event in a Get-Notifications response.

   The Printer MUST support this attribute if it supports the 'ippget'
   Delivery Method.  The value MUST be 15 or more (at least 15 seconds),
   and 60 (seconds) is the RECOMMENDED value to align with the PWG Job
   Monitoring MIB [<a href="rfc2707.html" title='"Job Monitoring MIB - V1.0"'>RFC2707</a>] jmGeneralJobPersistence and
   jmGeneralAttributePersistence objects.

   For example, assume the following:

   1.  A client performs a Job Creation operation that creates a
       Subscription Object associated with the 'ippget' Delivery Method;

   2.  An Event associated with the new Job occurs immediately after the
       Subscription Object is created;

   3.  the same client or some other client performs a Get-Notifications
       operation so that the client is connected N seconds after the Job
       Creation operation.

   Then, if N is less than the value of this attribute, the client(s)
   performing the Get-Notifications operations can expect not to miss
   any Event-Notifications, barring some unforeseen lack of memory space
   in the Printer.  Note:  The client MUST initiate the Get-
   Notifications at a time that is sufficiently less that N seconds to
   account for network latency so that it is connected to the Printer
   before N seconds elapses.

   If a Printer supports the 'ippget' Delivery Method, it MUST keep
   'completed', 'canceled', or 'aborted' Job objects in the Job
   Retention and/or Job History phases for at least as long as this
   attribute's value.  The Printer MAY retain jobs longer that this
   value.  See <a href="rfc2911.html#section-4.3.7.1">[RFC2911], section 4.3.7.1</a>, and the discussion in
   [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>] (regarding the 'job-completed' event).  The latter explains
   that a Notification Recipient can query the Job after receiving a
   'job-completed' Event Notification in order to find out other
   information about the job that is 'completed', 'aborted', or
   'canceled'.  However, this attribute has no effect on the Cancel-
   Subscription operation, which deletes the Subscription object
   immediately whether or not it contains the "notify-pull-method"
   attribute with the 'ippget' keyword value.  Immediately thereafter,
   subsequent Get-Notifications Responses MUST NOT contain Event
   Notifications associated with the canceled Subscription object.

   The Printer MUST return the 'successful-ok-events-complete' status
   code to indicate when this Get-Notifications response is the last
   response for a Subscription object, whether or not there are Event
   Notifications being returned.  This condition occurs for Event Wait
   Mode with Notification Recipients waiting for responses when (1) the
   Subscription Object is canceled with a Cancel-Subscription operation,
   (2) the Subscription object is deleted, when the Per-Printer
   Subscription lease time expires, or (3) the 'job-completed' event
   occurs for a Per-Job Subscription.  This condition also occurs for a
   Get-Notifications request that a Notification Recipient makes after
   the job completes, but before the Event Life expires.

   This section defines the encoding and transport considerations for
   this Delivery Method based on [<a href="rfc2910.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport"'>RFC2910</a>].

   The encoding of a Get-Notifications Response is modeled after the
   Get-Jobs Response (see [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>]).  In a Get-Notifications Response,
   each Event Notification Attributes Group MUST start with an 'event-
   notification-attributes-tag' (see the section "Encodings of
   Additional Attribute Tags" in [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>]), and end with an 'end-of-
   attributes-tag'.  In addition, for Event Wait Mode the multi-
   part/related is used to separate each multiple response (in time) to
   a single Get-Notifications Request.

   The Printer returns Get-Notification Response as follows:

   1.  If the Notification Recipient client did not request Event Wait
       Mode ("notify-wait" = 'false' or omitted), the Printer ends the
       response with an 'end-of-attributes-tag' (see [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>], Get-Jobs
       encoding), as with any operation response.

   2.  If the Notification Recipient client requests Event Wait Mode
       ("notify-wait" = 'true') and the Printer wishes to honor the
       request, the Printer MUST return the response as an
       application/ipp part inside a multi-part/related MIME media type.
       When one or more additional Events occur, the Printer returns
       each as an additional Event Notification Group using a separate
       application/ipp part under the multi-part/related type.

   3.  If the client requested Event Wait Mode ("notify-wait" = 'true'),
       but the Printer does not wish to honor the request in the initial
       response and wants the client explicitly polled for Event
       Notifications, the Printer MUST return the "notify-get-interval"
       operation attribute (see <a href="#section-5.2.1">section 5.2.1</a>).  The Printer returns the

       response as an application/ipp part that MAY be inside an multi-
       part/related type.  The client MUST accept this response and
       reissue the Get-Notifications request in the future indicated by
       the value of the "notify-get-interval" attribute value.

   4.  If the client requested Event Wait Mode ("notify-wait" = 'true'),
       and the Printer initially honored the request but later wishes to
       leave Event Wait Mode,  the Printer MUST return the "notify-get-
       interval" operation attribute (see <a href="#section-5.2.1">section 5.2.1</a>).  The Printer
       returns the response as an application/ipp part that MUST be
       inside an multi-part/related type.

   NOTE:  If a Notification Recipient fails to receive a response, it
   can ask the Printer for the same Event Notifications again.  The
   Notification Recipient will receive the same Event Notifications that
   it should have received the first time, except for those Event
   Notifications that have expired in the meantime.

   The Printer MAY chunk the responses, but this has no significance to
   the IPP semantics.

   This notification delivery method uses the IPP transport and encoding
   [<a href="rfc2910.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport"'>RFC2910</a>] for the Get-Notifications operation with the following
   extension, allocated in [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>]:

   In addition, when the client receives the Get-Notifications response,
   it is expected to localize the attributes that have the 'keyword'
   attribute syntax according to the charset and natural language
   requested in the Get-Notifications request.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/17.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-17" name="section-17">17</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The IPP Model and Semantics document [RFC2911, <a href="#section-8">section 8</a>] discusses
   high-level security requirements (Client Authentication, Server
   Authentication and Operation Privacy).  The IPP Transport and
   Encoding document [RFC2910, <a href="#section-8">section 8</a>] discusses the security
   requirements for the IPP protocol.  Client Authentication is the
   mechanism by which the client proves its identity to the server in a
   secure manner.  Server Authentication is the mechanism by which the
   server proves its identity to the client in a secure manner.
   Operation Privacy is defined as a mechanism for protecting operations
   from eavesdropping.

   The 'ippget' Delivery Method with its Get-Notifications operations
   leverages the security mechanism that are used in IPP/1.1 [RFC2910
   and <a href="rfc2911.html">RFC2911</a>] without adding any additional security mechanisms in
   order to maintain the same security support as IPP/1.1.

   The access control model for the Get-Notifications operation defined
   in this document is the same as the access control model for the
   Get-Job-Attributes operation (see <a href="rfc2911.html#section-3.2.6">[RFC2911], section 3.2.6</a>).  The
   primary difference is that a Get-Notifications operation is directed
   at Subscription Objects rather than at Job objects, and a returned
   attribute group contains Event Notification attributes rather than
   Job object attributes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/17.1.%20%20Notification%20Recipient%20Client%20Access%20Rights"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-17.1" name="section-17.1">17.1</a>.  Notification Recipient Client Access Rights</span>

   The Notification Recipient client MUST have the following access
   rights to the Subscription object(s) targeted by the Get-
   Notifications operation request:

      The authenticated user (see <a href="rfc2911.html#section-8.3">[RFC2911], section 8.3</a>) performing
      this operation MUST be (1) the owner of each Subscription Object
      identified by the "notify-subscription-ids" operation attribute
      (see <a href="#section-5.1.1">section 5.1.1</a>), (2) an operator or administrator of the
      Printer (see [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>], sections <a href="#section-1">1</a> and <a href="#section-8.5">8.5</a>), or (3) otherwise
      authorized by the Printer's administrator-configured security
      policy to request Event Notifications from the target Subscription
      Object(s).  Furthermore, the Printer's security policy MAY limit

      the attributes returned by the Get-Notifications operation, in a
      manner similar to that of the Get-Job-Attributes operation (see
      [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>], end of <a href="#section-3.3.4.2">section 3.3.4.2</a>).

   Because the Get-Notifications operation is sent in the same direction
   as are Job Creation operations, usually by the same client, this
   Event Notification Delivery Method poses no additional
   authentication, authorization, privacy, firewall, or port assignment
   issues above those for the IPP Get-Job-Attributes and Get-Printer-
   Attributes operations (see [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>], sections <a href="#section-3.2.6">3.2.6</a> and <a href="#section-3.2.5">3.2.5</a>).

   Unwanted Events Notifications (spam):  Unlike Push Event Notification
   Delivery Methods in which the IPP Printer initiates the Event
   Notification, with the Pull Delivery Method defined in this document,
   the Notification Recipient is the client that initiates the Get-
   Notifications operation (see <a href="#section-5">section 5</a>).  Therefore, with this method
   there is no chance of "spam" notifications.

   Note:  When a client stays connected to a Printer by using the Event
   Wait Mode (see <a href="#section-5.1.3">section 5.1.3</a>) in order to receive Event Notifications
   as they occur, it can close down the IPP connection at any time and
   so can avoid future unwanted Event Notifications at any time.

   It is true that the client has control over whether to ask for Event
   Notifications.  However, if the client subscribes to an event and
   does a Get-Notifications request, it gets all events for the
   Subscription Object in the sequence number range (see <a href="#section-5.1.2">section 5.1.2</a>),
   not just those it wants.  If a client subscribes to a Per-Printer
   Subscription job event, such as 'job-completed', and someone then
   starts and cancels thousands of jobs, the client would have to
   receive these events in addition to those it is interested in.  A
   client can protect itself better by subscribing to its own jobs by
   using a Per-Job Subscription, rather than create a Per-Printer
   subscription whose Job events apply to all jobs.

   For the Get-Notifications operation defined in this document, the
   same Printer conformance requirements apply for supporting and using
   Client Authentication, Server Authentication and Operation Privacy as
   stated in <a href="rfc2910.html#section-8">[RFC2910] section 8</a> for all IPP operations.

   The base set of IPP documents includes the following:

     Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol [<a href="rfc2567.html" title='"Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol"'>RFC2567</a>]
     Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the Internet
       Printing Protocol [<a href="rfc2568.html" title='"Rationale for the Structure of the Model and Protocol for the Internet Printing Protocol"'>RFC2568</a>]
     Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>]

     Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols [<a href="rfc2569.html" title='"Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols"'>RFC2569</a>]

   "Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol" takes a broad look
   at distributed printing functionality, and it enumerates real-life
   scenarios that help clarify the features that need to be included in
   a printing protocol for the Internet.  It identifies requirements for
   three types of users: end users, operators, and administrators.  It
   calls out a subset of end user requirements that are satisfied in
   IPP/1.0 [RFC2566, <a href="rfc2565.html">RFC2565</a>].  A few OPTIONAL operator operations have
   been added to IPP/1.1.

   "Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the Internet
   Printing Protocol" describes IPP from a high-level view, defines a
   roadmap for the various documents that form the suite of IPP
   specification documents, and gives background and rationale for the
   IETF working group's major decisions.

   "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics" describes a
   simplified model with abstract objects, their attributes, and their
   operations that are independent of encoding and transport.  It
   introduces a Printer and a Job object.  The Job object optionally
   supports multiple documents per Job.  It also addresses security,
   internationalization, and directory issues.

   "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport" is a formal
   mapping of the abstract operations and attributes defined in the
   model document onto HTTP/1.1 [<a href="rfc2616.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"'>RFC2616</a>].  It defines the encoding
   rules for a new Internet MIME media type called "application/ipp".
   This document also defines the rules for transporting over HTTP a
   message body whose Content-Type is "application/ipp".  This document
   defines the 'ipp' scheme for identifying IPP printers and jobs.

   "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer's Guide" gives insight
   and advice to implementers of IPP clients and IPP objects.  It is
   intended to help them understand IPP/1.1 and some of the
   considerations that may assist them in the design of their client
   and/or IPP object implementations.  For example, a typical order of
   processing requests is given, including error checking.  Motivation
   for some of the specification decisions is also included.

   "Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols" gives some advice to
   implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer Daemon)
   implementations.

   Carl Kugler and Harry Lewis contributed the basic idea of in-band
   "smart polling" coupled with multiple responses for a single
   operation on the same connection, with one response for each event as
   it occurs.  Without their continual persuasion, we would not have
   arrived at this Delivery Method specification and would not have been
   able to agree on a single REQUIRED Delivery Method for IPP.
