Abstract

   There are many networking glossaries in existence.  This glossary
   concentrates on terms which are specific to the Internet.  Naturally,
   there are entries for some basic terms and acronyms because other
   entries refer to them.


Acknowledgements

   This document is the work of the User Glossary Working Group of the
   User Services Area of the Internet Engineering Task Force.  I would
   especially like to thank Ryan Moats/InterNIC for his careful review
   and many contributions to this document.

Glossary

   10Base2
      A physical layer communications specification for 10Mbps, baseband
      data transmission over a coaxial cable (Thinnet) with a maximum
      cable segment length of 200 meters.

   10Base5
      A physical layer communications specification for 10Mbps, baseband
      data transmission over a coaxial cable (Thicknet) with a maximum
      cable segment length of 500 meters.

   10BaseF
      A physical layer communications specification for 10Mbps, baseband
      data transmission over a fiber-optic cable.

   10BaseT
      A physical layer communications specification for 10Mbps, baseband
      data transmission over a twisted-pair copper wire.

   802.x
      The set of IEEE standards for the definition of LAN protocols.
      See also: IEEE.

   822
      See: <a href="rfc822.html">RFC 822</a>

   :-)
      This odd symbol is one of the ways a person can portray "mood" in
      the very flat medium of computers--by using "smiley faces".  This
      is "metacommunication", and there are literally hundreds of such
      symbols, from the obvious to the obscure.  This particular example
      expresses "happiness".  Don't see it?  Tilt your head to the left
      90 degrees.  Smiles are also used to denote sarcasm.
      [Source: ZEN]

   abstract syntax
      A description of a data structure that is independent of machine-
      oriented structures and encodings.
      [Source: <a href="rfc1208.html">RFC1208</a>]

   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
      The language used by the OSI protocols for describing abstract
      syntax.  This language is also used to encode SNMP packets.  ASN.1
      is defined in ISO documents 8824.2 and 8825.2.  See also: Basic
      Encoding Rules.

   Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
      Many transit networks have policies which restrict the use to
      which the network may be put.  For example, some networks may only
      be used for non-commercial purposes.  Some AUPs limit the type of
      material which can be made available to the public (e.g.,
      pornographic material).  Enforcement of AUPs varies with the
      network.  See also: netiquette.

   Access Control List (ACL)
      Most network security systems operate by allowing selective use of
      services.  An Access Control List is the usual means by which
      access to, and denial of, services is controlled.  It is simply a
      list of the services available, each with a list of the hosts
      permitted to use the service.

   ACK
      See: Acknowledgment

   acknowledgment (ACK)
      A type of message sent to indicate that a block of data arrived at
      its destination without error.  See also: Negative
      Acknowledgement.
      [Source: NNSC]

   ACL
      See: Access Control List

   AD
      See: Administrative Domain

   address
      There are four types of addresses in common use within the
      Internet.  They are email address; IP, internet or Internet
      address; hardware or MAC address; and URL.  See also: email
      address, IP address, internet address, MAC address, Uniform
      Resource Locator.

   address mask
      A bit mask used to identify which bits in an IP address correspond
      to the network and subnet portions of the address.  This mask is
      often referred to as the subnet mask because the network portion
      of the address (i.e., the network mask) can be determined by the
      encoding inherent in an IP address.  See also: Classless Inter-
      domain Routing.

   address resolution
      Conversion of a network-layer address (e.g. IP address) into the
      corresponding physical address (e.g., MAC address).  See also: IP
      address, MAC address.

   Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
      Used to dynamically discover the low level physical network
      hardware address that corresponds to the high level IP address for
      a given host.  ARP is limited to physical network systems that
      support broadcast packets that can be heard by all hosts on the
      network.  See also: proxy ARP, Reverse Address Resolution
      Protocol.

   Administrative Domain (AD)
      A collection of hosts and routers, and the interconnecting
      network(s), managed by a single administrative authority.

   Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)
      An agency of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for the
      development of new technology for use by the military.  ARPA
      (formerly known as DARPA, nee ARPA) was responsible for funding
      much of the development of the Internet we know today, including
      the Berkeley version of Unix and TCP/IP.
      [Source: NNSC]

   Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)
      A pioneering longhaul network funded by ARPA.  Now retired, it
      served as the basis for early networking research as well as a
      central backbone during the development of the Internet.  The
      ARPANET consisted of individual packet switching computers
      interconnected by leased lines.  See also: Advanced Research
      Projects Agency.
      [Source: FYI4]

   agent
      In the client-server model, the part of the system that performs
      information preparation and exchange on behalf of a client or
      server application.
      [Source: <a href="rfc1208.html">RFC1208</a>]

   alias
      A name, usually short and easy to remember, that is translated
      into another name, usually long and difficult to remember.

   American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
      This organization is responsible for approving U.S. standards in
      many areas, including computers and communications.  Standards
      approved by this organization are often called ANSI standards

   anonymous FTP
      Anonymous FTP allows a user to retrieve documents, files,
      programs, and other archived data from anywhere in the Internet
      without having to establish a userid and password.  By using the
      special userid of "anonymous" the network user will bypass local
      security checks and will have access to publicly accessible files
      on the remote system.  See also: archive site, File Transfer
      Protocol, World Wide Web.

   application
      A program that performs a function directly for a user.  FTP, mail
      and Telnet clients are examples of network applications.

   application layer
      The top layer of the network protocol stack.  The application
      layer is concerned with the semantics of work (e.g. formatting
      electronic mail messages).  How to represent that data and how to
      reach the foreign node are issues for lower layers of the network.

   distributed database
      A collection of several different data repositories that looks
      like a single database to the user.  A prime example in the
      Internet is the Domain Name System.

   DIX Ethernet
      See: Ethernet

   DNS
      See: Domain Name System

   domain
      "Domain" is a heavily overused term in the Internet.  It can be
      used in the Administrative Domain context, or the Domain Name
      context.  See also: Administrative Domain, Domain Name System.

   Domain Name System (DNS)
      The DNS is a general purpose distributed, replicated, data query
      service.  The principal use is the lookup of host IP addresses
      based on host names.  The style of host names now used in the
      Internet is called "domain name", because they are the style of
      names used to look up anything in the DNS.  Some important domains
      are: .COM (commercial), .EDU (educational), .NET (network
      operations), .GOV (U.S. government), and .MIL (U.S. military).
      Most countries also have a domain.  The country domain names are
      based on ISO 3166.  For example, .US (United States), .UK (United
      Kingdom), .AU (Australia).  See also: Fully Qualified Domain Name,
      Mail Exchange Record.

   dot address (dotted decimal notation)
      Dot address refers to the common notation for IP addresses of the

   encapsulation
      The technique used by layered protocols in which a layer adds
      header information to the protocol data unit (PDU) from the layer
      above.  For example, in Internet terminology, a packet would
      contain a header from the physical layer, followed by a header
      from the datalink layer (e.g.  Ethernet), followed by a header
      from the network layer (IP), followed by a header from the
      transport layer (e.g. TCP), followed by the application protocol
      data.

      of "gateway".  Currently, a gateway is a communications
      device/program which passes data between networks having similar
      functions but dissimilar implementations.  This should not be
      confused with a protocol converter.  By this definition, a router

   hierarchical routing
      The complex problem of routing on large networks can be simplified
      by reducing the size of the networks.  This is accomplished by
      breaking a network into a hierarchy of networks, where each level
      is responsible for its own routing.  The Internet has, basically,
      three levels: the backbones, the mid-levels, and the stub
      networks.  The backbones know how to route between the mid-levels,
      the mid-levels know how to route between the sites, and each site
      (being an autonomous system) knows how to route internally.  See
      also: Autonomous System, Exterior Gateway Protocol, Interior
      Gateway Protocol, stub network, transit network.

   Internet Protocol (IP, IPv4)
      The Internet Protocol (version 4), defined in <a href="rfc791.html">RFC 791</a>, is the
      network layer for the TCP/IP Protocol Suite.  It is a
      connectionless, best-effort packet switching protocol.  See also:
      packet switching, TCP/IP Protocol Suite, Internet Protocol Version
      6.

   Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPng, IPv6)
      IPv6 (version 5 is a stream protocol used for special
      applications) is a new version of the Internet Protocol which is
      designed to be an evolutionary step from its predecessor, version
      4.  There are many RFCs defining various portions of the protocol,
      its auxiliary protocols, and the transition plan from IPv4.  The
      core RFCs are 1883 through 1886.  The name IPng (IP next
      generation) is a nod to STNG (Star Trek Next Generation).

   Internet Registry (IR)
      The IANA has the discretionary authority to delegate portions of
      its responsibility and, with respect to network address and
      Autonomous System identifiers, has lodged this responsibility with
      an IR.  The IR function is performed by the DDN NIC.  See also:

   layer
      Communication networks for computers may be organized as a set of
      more or less independent protocols, each in a different layer
      (also called level).  The lowest layer governs direct host-to-host
      communication between the hardware at different hosts; the highest
      consists of user applications.  Each layer builds on the layer
      beneath it.  For each layer, programs at different hosts use
      protocols appropriate to the layer to communicate with each other.
      TCP/IP has five layers of protocols; OSI has seven.  The
      advantages of different layers of protocols is that the methods of
      passing information from one layer to another are specified
      clearly as part of the protocol suite, and changes within a
      protocol layer are prevented from affecting the other layers.
      This greatly simplifies the task of designing and maintaining
      communication programs.  See also: Open Systems Interconnection,

   Lycos
      Lycos, Inc. is a new venture formed in late June 1995, to develop
      and market the Lycos technology originally developed under the
      direction of Dr. Michael ("Fuzzy") Mauldin at Carnegie Mellon
      University.  The part of Lycos you see when you do a search is the
      search engine.  "Lycos" comes from Lycosidae, a cosmopolitan
      family of relatively large active ground spiders (Wolf Spiders)
      that catch their prey by pursuit, rather than in a web.

   mail gateway
      A machine that connects two or more electronic mail systems
      (including dissimilar mail systems) and transfers messages between
      them.  Sometimes the mapping and translation can be quite complex,
      and it generally requires a store-and-forward scheme whereby the
      message is received from one system completely before it is
      transmitted to the next system, after suitable translations.  See
      also: Electronic Mail.
      [Source: <a href="rfc1208.html">RFC1208</a>]

   mailing list
      A list of email addresses, used by a mail exploder, to forward
      messages to groups of people.  Generally, a mailing list is used
      to discuss certain set of topics, and different mailing lists
      discuss different topics.  A mailing list may be moderated.  This
      means that messages sent to the list are actually sent to a
      moderator who determines whether or not to send the messages on to
      everyone else.  Requests to subscribe to, or leave, a mailing list
      should ALWAYS be sent to the list's "-request" address (e.g.
      ietf-request@cnri.reston.va.us for the IETF mailing list) or
      majordomo server.  See also: Electronic Mail, mail exploder, email
      address, moderator, majordomo.

      throughout the world.  At the following meeting, in Cambridge, the
      name mbone was adopted.  Since then the audiocast has become full
      two-way audio/video conferencing using two video channels, four
      audio channels, and involving hundreds of remote users.  See also:

   TTL
      See: Time to Live

   tunnelling
      Tunnelling refers to encapsulation of protocol A within protocol
      B, such that A treats B as though it were a datalink layer.
      Tunnelling is used to get data between administrative domains
      which use a protocol that is not supported by the internet
      connecting those domains.  See also: Administrative Domain.

   twisted pair
      A type of cable in which pairs of conductors are twisted together
      to produce certain electrical properties.

      An address which only one host will recognize.  See also:
      broadcast, multicast.

   Uniform Resource Locators (URL)
      A URL is a compact (most of the time) string representation for a
      resource available on the Internet.  URLs are primarily used to
      retrieve information using WWW.  The syntax and semantics for URLs
      are defined in <a href="rfc1738.html">RFC 1738</a>.  See also: World Wide Web.

   Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)
      This is Greenwich Mean Time.

   UNIX-to-UNIX CoPy (UUCP)
      This was initially a program run under the UNIX operating system
      that allowed one UNIX system to send files to another UNIX system
      via dial-up phone lines.  Today, the term is more commonly used to
      describe the large international network which uses the UUCP
      protocol to pass news and electronic mail.  See also: Electronic
      Mail, Usenet.

   urban legend
      A story, which may have started with a grain of truth, that has
      been embroidered and retold until it has passed into the realm of
      myth.  It is an interesting phenonmenon that these stories get
      spread so far, so fast and so often.  Urban legends never die,
      they just end up on the Internet!  Some legends that periodically
      make their rounds include "The Infamous Modem Tax," "Craig
      Shergold/Brain Tumor/Get Well Cards," and "The $250 Cookie
      Recipe."

   Usenet
      A collection of thousands of topically named newsgroups, the
      computers which run the protocols, and the people who read and
      submit Usenet news.  Not all Internet hosts subscribe to Usenet
      and not all Usenet hosts are on the Internet.  See also: Network

   User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
      An Internet Standard transport layer protocol defined in <a href="rfc768.html">RFC 768</a>.
      It is a connectionless protocol which adds a level of reliability
      and multiplexing to IP.  See also: connectionless, Transmission
      Control Protocol.

   uudecode
      A program which reverses the effect of uuencode.  See also:
      uuencode.

   uuencode
      A program which reversibly converts a binary file in ASCII.  It is
      used to send binary files via email, which generally does not
      allow (or garbles) the transmission of binary information.  The
      original binary can be restored with uudecode.  The encoding
      process generally creates an ASCII file larger than the original
      binary, so compressing the binary before running uuencode is
      highly recommended.

   Veronica
      A Gopher utility which effectively searches Gopher servers based
      on a user's list of keywords.  The name was chosen to be a "mate"
      to another utility named "Archie."  It later became an acronym for
      Very Easy Rodent Oriented Netwide Index to Computer Archives.  See
      also: archie, Gopher.

   white pages
      The Internet supports several databases that contain basic
      information about users, such as e-mail addresses, telephone
      numbers, and postal addresses.  These databases can be searched to
      get information about particular individuals.  Because they serve
      a function akin to the telephone book, these databases are often
      referred to as "white pages."  See also: Knowbot, netfind, whois,
      X.500, InterNIC.

   whois
      An Internet program which allows users to query a database of
      people and other Internet entities, such as domains, networks, and
      hosts.  The primary database is kept at the InterNIC.  The

      information stored includes a person's company name, address,
      phone number and email address.  The latest version of the
      protocol, WHOIS++, is defined in RFCs 1834 and 1835.  See also:
      InterNIC, white pages, Knowbot, netfind, X.500.

   Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS)
      A distributed information service which offers simple natural
      language input, indexed searching for fast retrieval, and a
      "relevance feedback" mechanism which allows the results of initial
      searches to influence future searches.  Public domain
      implementations are available.  See also: archie, Gopher,
      Prospero.

   Wide Area Network (WAN)
      A network, usually constructed with serial lines, which covers a
      large geographic area.  See also: Local Area Network, Metropolitan
      Area Network.

   Working Group (WG)
      A working group, within the IETF, is a group of people who work
      under a charter to achieve a certain goal.  That goal may be the
      creation of an Informational document, the creation of a protocol
      specification, or the resolution of problems in the Internet.
      Most working groups have a finite lifetime.  That is, once a
      working group has achieved its goal, it disbands.  There is no
      official membership for a working group.  Unofficially, a working
      group member is somebody who is on that working group's mailing
      list; however, anyone may attend a working group meeting.  See
      also: Internet Engineering Task Force, Birds Of a Feather.

   World Wide Web (WWW, W3)
      A hypertext-based, distributed information system created by
      researchers at CERN in Switzerland.  Users may create, edit or
      browse hypertext documents.  The clients and servers are freely
      available.

   worm
      A computer program which replicates itself and is self-
      propagating.  Worms, as opposed to viruses, are meant to spawn in
      network environments.  Network worms were first defined by Shoch &amp;
      Hupp of Xerox in ACM Communications (March 1982).  The Internet
      worm of November 1988 is perhaps the most famous; it successfully
      propagated itself on over 6,000 systems across the Internet.  See
      also: Trojan Horse, virus.

   Xerox Network System (XNS)
      A protocol suite developed by Xerox Corporation to run on LAN and
      WAN networks, where the LANs are typically Ethernet.
      Implementations exist for both Xerox's workstations and 4.3BSD,
      and 4.3BSD-derived, systems.  XNS denotes not only the protocol
      stack, but also an architecture of standard programming
      interfaces, conventions, and service functions for authentication,
      directory, filing, email, and remote procedure call.  XNS is also
      the name of Xerox's implementation.  See also: Ethernet, Berkeley
      Software Distribution, Local Area Network, Wide Area Network.
