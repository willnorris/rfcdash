Abstract

   This document describes how to use a Generic Security Service
   Application Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism in the Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.  This is done by
   defining a new SASL mechanism family, called GS2.  This mechanism
   family offers a number of improvements over the previous "SASL/
   GSSAPI" mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages for the
   authentication phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of
   channel binding.  Only GSS-API mechanisms that support channel
   binding and mutual authentication are supported.

   Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
   [<a href="rfc2743.html" title='"Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2, Update 1"'>RFC2743</a>] is a framework that provides security services to
   applications using a variety of authentication mechanisms.  Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [<a href="rfc4422.html" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>] is a framework to
   provide authentication and security layers for connection-based
   protocols, also using a variety of mechanisms.  This document
   describes how to use a GSS-API mechanism as though it were a SASL
   mechanism.  This facility is called GS2 -- a moniker that indicates
   that this is the second GSS-API-&gt;SASL mechanism bridge.  The original
   GSS-API-&gt;SASL mechanism bridge was specified by [<a href="rfc2222.html" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC2222</a>], now
   [<a href="rfc4752.html" title='"The Kerberos V5 ("'>RFC4752</a>]; we shall sometimes refer to the original bridge as GS1 in
   this document.

   All GSS-API mechanisms are implicitly registered for use within SASL
   by this specification.  The SASL mechanisms defined in this document
   are known as the GS2 family of mechanisms.

   The GS1 bridge failed to gain wide deployment for any GSS-API
   mechanism other than "The Kerberos Version 5 GSS-API Mechanism"
   [<a href="rfc1964.html" title='"The Kerberos Version 5 GSS-API Mechanism"'>RFC1964</a>] [<a href="rfc4121.html" title='"The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2"'>RFC4121</a>], and has a number of problems that led us to
   desire a new bridge.  Specifically, a) GS1 was not round-trip
   optimized and b) GS1 did not support channel binding [<a href="rfc5056.html" title='"On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure Channels"'>RFC5056</a>].
   These problems and the opportunity to create the next SASL password-
   based mechanism, "Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism
   (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms" [<a href="rfc5802.html" title='"Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms"'>RFC5802</a>], as a GSS-API
   mechanism used by SASL applications via GS2, provide the motivation
   for GS2.

   In particular, the current consensus of the SASL community appears to
   be that SASL "security layers" (i.e., confidentiality and integrity
   protection of application data after authentication) are too complex
   and redundant because SASL applications tend to have an option to run
   over a Transport Layer Security (TLS) [<a href="rfc5246.html" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>] channel.  Use of SASL
   security layers is best replaced with channel binding to a TLS
   channel.

   GS2 is designed to be as simple as possible.  It adds to GSS-API
   security context token exchanges only the bare minimum to support
   SASL semantics and negotiation of use of channel binding.
   Specifically, GS2 adds a small header (a few bytes plus the length of
   the client-requested SASL authorization identity) to the initial GSS-
   API context token and to the application channel binding data.  GS2
   uses SASL mechanism negotiation to implement channel binding
   negotiation.  Security-relevant GS2 plaintext is protected via the
   use of GSS-API channel binding.  Additionally, to simplify the

   channel over which all SASL and application plaintext is sent will
   cause all that plaintext to be authenticated.

   There are two SASL mechanism names for any GSS-API mechanism used
   through this facility.  One denotes that the server supports channel
   binding.  The other denotes that it does not.

   The SASL mechanism name for a GSS-API mechanism is that which is
   provided by that mechanism when it was specified, if one was
   specified.  This name denotes that the server does not support
   channel binding.  Add the suffix "-PLUS" and the resulting name
   denotes that the server does support channel binding.  SASL
   implementations can use the GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech call (see
   below) to query for the SASL mechanism name of a GSS-API mechanism.

   If the GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech interface is not used, the GS2
   implementation needs some other mechanism to map mechanism Object
   Identifiers (OIDs) to SASL names internally.  In this case, the
   implementation can only support the mechanisms for which it knows the
   SASL name.  If GSS_Inquire_SASLname_for_mech() fails and the GS2
   implementation cannot map the OID to a SASL mechanism name via some
   other means, then the GS2 implementation MUST NOT use the given GSS-
   API mechanism.

   For GSS-API mechanisms whose SASL names are not defined together with
   the GSS-API mechanism or in this document, the SASL mechanism name is
   concatenation of the string "GS2-" and the Base32 encoding [<a href="rfc4648.html" title='"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings"'>RFC4648</a>]

   characters and characters outside of the Base32 alphabet are not
   relevant to this use of Base32.  If any padding or non-alphabet
   characters are encountered, the name is not a GS2 family mechanism
   name.  This name denotes that the server does not support channel
   binding.  Add the suffix "-PLUS" and the resulting name denotes that
   the server does support channel binding.

   A GS2 mechanism that has a non-OID-derived SASL mechanism name is
   said to have a "user-friendly SASL mechanism name".

   The hash-derived GS2 SASL mechanism name may be computed manually.
   This is useful when the set of supported GSS-API mechanisms is known
   in advance.  This eliminates the need to implement Base32, SHA-1, and
   DER in the SASL mechanism.  The computed mechanism name can be used
   directly in the implementation, and the implementation need not be
   concerned if the mechanism is part of a mechanism family.

   During the SASL authentication exchange for GS2, a number of messages
   following the following format are sent between the client and
   server.  On success, this number is the same as the number of context
   tokens that the GSS-API mechanism would normally require in order to
   establish a security context.  On failures, the exchange can be
   terminated early by any party.

   When using a GS2 mechanism the SASL client is always a GSS-API
   initiator and the SASL server is always a GSS-API acceptor.  The
   client calls GSS_Init_sec_context and the server calls
   GSS_Accept_sec_context.

   All the SASL authentication messages exchanged are exactly the same
   as the security context tokens of the GSS-API mechanism, except for
   the initial security context token.

   The client and server MAY send GSS-API error tokens (tokens output by
   GSS_Init_sec_context() or GSS_Accept_sec_context() when the major
   status code is other than GSS_S_COMPLETE or GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED).
   As this indicates an error condition, after sending the token, the
   sending side should fail the authentication.

   The initial security context token is modified as follows:

   o  The initial context token header (see <a href="rfc2743.html#section-3.1">Section 3.1 of [RFC2743]</a>)
      MUST be removed if present.  If the header is not present, the
      client MUST send a "gs2-nonstd-flag" flag (see below).  On the
      server side, this header MUST be recomputed and restored prior to
      passing the token to GSS_Accept_sec_context, except when the "gs2-
      nonstd-flag" is sent.

   o  A GS2 header MUST be prefixed to the resulting initial context
      token.  This header has the form "gs2-header" given below in ABNF
      [<a href="rfc5234.html" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>RFC5234</a>].

   The figure below describes the permissible attributes, their use, and
   the format of their values.  All attribute names are single US-ASCII
   letters and are case sensitive.

   returned by GSS_Init_sec_context.  This signals to the server that it
   MUST NOT re-add the data that is normally removed by the client.

   The "gs2-cb-flag" signals the channel binding mode.  One of "p", "n",
   or "y" is used.  A "p" means the client supports and used a channel
   binding, and the name of the channel binding type is indicated.  An
   "n" means that the client does not support channel binding.  A "y"
   means the client supports channel binding, but believes the server
   does not support it, so it did not use a channel binding.  See the
   next section for more details.

   The "gs2-authzid" holds the SASL authorization identity.  It is

   GS2 supports channel binding to external secure channels, such as
   TLS.  Clients and servers may or may not support channel binding;
   therefore, the use of channel binding is negotiable.  However, GS2
   does not provide security layers; therefore, it is imperative that
   GS2 provide integrity protection for the negotiation of channel
   binding.

   Use of channel binding is negotiated as follows:

   o  Servers that support the use of channel binding SHOULD advertise
      both the non-PLUS and PLUS-variant of each GS2 mechanism name.  If
      the server cannot support channel binding, it SHOULD advertise
      only the non-PLUS-variant.  If the server would never succeed in
      the authentication of the non-PLUS-variant due to policy reasons,
      it MUST advertise only the PLUS-variant.

   o  If the client supports channel binding and the server does not
      appear to (i.e., the client did not see the -PLUS name advertised
      by the server), then the client MUST NOT use an "n" gs2-cb-flag.

   o  Clients that support mechanism negotiation and channel binding
      MUST use a "p" gs2-cb-flag when the server offers the PLUS-variant
      of the desired GS2 mechanism.

   o  If the client does not support channel binding, then it MUST use
      an "n" gs2-cb-flag.  Conversely, if the client requires the use of
      channel binding then it MUST use a "p" gs2-cb-flag.  Clients that
      do not support mechanism negotiation never use a "y" gs2-cb-flag,
      they use either "p" or "n" according to whether they require and
      support the use of channel binding or whether they do not,
      respectively.

   o  The client generates the chan_bindings input parameter for
      GSS_Init_sec_context as described below.

   o  Upon receipt of the initial authentication message, the server
      checks the gs2-cb-flag in the GS2 header and constructs a
      chan_bindings parameter for GSS_Accept_sec_context as described
      below.  If the client channel binding flag was "y" and the server
      did advertise support for channel bindings (by advertising the

      server MUST fail authentication.  If the client channel binding

   A default channel binding type agreement process for all SASL
   application protocols that do not provide their own channel binding
   type agreement is provided as follows.

   'tls-unique' is the default channel binding type for any application
   that doesn't specify one.

   Servers MUST implement the "tls-unique" [<a href="rfc5929.html" title='"Channel Bindings for TLS"'>RFC5929</a>] channel binding
   type, if they implement any channel binding.  Clients SHOULD
   implement the "tls-unique" channel binding type, if they implement
   any channel binding.  Clients and servers SHOULD choose the highest-
   layer/innermost end-to-end TLS channel as the channel to which to
   bind.

   Servers MUST choose the channel binding type indicated by the client,
   or fail authentication if they don't support it.

   GSS-API authentication is always initiated by the client.  The SASL
   framework allows either the client or the server to initiate
   authentication.  In GS2, the server will send an initial empty
   challenge (zero-byte string) if it has not yet received a token from
   the client.  See <a href="rfc4422.html#section-3">Section 3 of [RFC4422]</a>.

   Authentication MUST NOT succeed if any one of the following
   conditions are true:

   o  If GSS_Init/Accept_sec_context returns anything other than
      GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED or GSS_S_COMPLETE.

   o  If the client's initial GS2 header does not match the ABNF.

   o  In particular, if the initial character of the client message is
      anything except "F", "p", "n", or "y".

   o  If the client's GS2 channel binding flag was "y" and the server
      supports channel bindings.

   o  If the client's GS2 channel binding flag was "p" and the server
      does not support the indicated channel binding.

   o  If the client requires use of channel binding and the server did
      not advertise support for channel binding.

   o  If authorization of client principal (i.e., src_name in
      GSS_Accept_sec_context) to requested authzid failed.

   o  If the client is not authorized to the requested authzid or an
      authzid could not be derived from the client's initiator principal
      name.

   GS2 does not use any GSS-API per-message tokens.  Therefore, the per-
   message token ret_flags from GSS_Init_sec_context() and
   GSS_Accept_sec_context() are irrelevant; implementations SHOULD NOT
   set the per-message req_flags.

   The mutual_req_flag MUST be set.  Clients MUST check that the
   corresponding ret_flag is set when the context is fully established,
   else authentication MUST fail.

   Use or non-use of deleg_req_flag and anon_req_flag is an
   implementation-specific detail.  SASL and GS2 implementors are
   encouraged to provide programming interfaces by which clients may
   choose to delegate credentials and by which servers may receive them.
   SASL and GS2 implementors are encouraged to provide programming
   interfaces that provide a good mapping of GSS-API naming options.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20%20Naming"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>.  Naming</span>

   There is no requirement that any particular GSS-API name-types be
   used.  However, typically, SASL servers will have host-based acceptor
   principal names (see <a href="rfc2743.html#section-4.1">[RFC2743], Section 4.1</a>) and clients will
   typically have username initiator principal names (see <a href="rfc2743.html#section-4.2">[RFC2743],
   Section 4.2</a>).  When a host-based acceptor principal name is used
   ("service@hostname"), "service" is the service name specified in the
   protocol's profile and "hostname" is the fully qualified host name of
   the server.

   GS2 does not support SASL security layers.  Applications that need
   integrity or confidentiality protection can use either channel
   binding to a secure external channel or another SASL mechanism that
   does provide security layers.

   The Kerberos V5 GSS-API [<a href="rfc1964.html" title='"The Kerberos Version 5 GSS-API Mechanism"'>RFC1964</a>] mechanism is currently used in SASL
   under the name GSSAPI, see [<a href="rfc4752.html" title='"The Kerberos V5 ("'>RFC4752</a>].  The Kerberos V5 mechanism may
   also be used with the GS2 family.  This causes an interoperability
   problem, which is discussed and resolved below.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/13.1.%20%20The%20Interoperability%20Problem"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-13.1" name="section-13.1">13.1</a>.  The Interoperability Problem</span>

   The SASL "GSSAPI" mechanism is not wire compatible with the Kerberos
   V GSS-API mechanism used as a SASL GS2 mechanism.

   If a client (or server) only support Kerberos V5 under the "GSSAPI"
   name, and the server (or client) only support Kerberos V5 under the
   GS2 family, the mechanism negotiation will fail.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/13.2.%20%20Resolving%20the%20Problem"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-13.2" name="section-13.2">13.2</a>.  Resolving the Problem</span>

   If the Kerberos V5 mechanism is supported under GS2 in a server, the
   server SHOULD also support Kerberos V5 through the "GSSAPI"
   mechanism, to avoid interoperability problems with older clients.

   Reasons for violating this recommendation may include security
   considerations regarding the absent features in the GS2 mechanism.
   The SASL "GSSAPI" mechanism lacks support for channel bindings, which
   means that using an external secure channel may not be sufficient
   protection against active attackers (see [<a href="rfc5056.html" title='"On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure Channels"'>RFC5056</a>] and [<a href="#ref-MITM" title='"Man-in-the-Middle in Tunnelled Authentication"'>MITM</a>]).

   If the application requires SASL security layers, then it MUST use
   the SASL "GSSAPI" mechanism [<a href="rfc4752.html" title='"The Kerberos V5 ("'>RFC4752</a>] instead of "GS2-KRB5" or "GS2-
   KRB5-PLUS".

   If the application can use channel binding to an external channel,
   then it is RECOMMENDED that it select Kerberos V5 through the GS2
   mechanism rather than the "GSSAPI" mechanism.

   A GSS-API mechanism that negotiates other mechanisms will interact
   badly with the SASL mechanism negotiation.  There are two problems.
   The first is an interoperability problem and the second is a security
   concern.  The problems are described and resolved below.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/14.1.%20%20The%20Interoperability%20Problem"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-14.1" name="section-14.1">14.1</a>.  The Interoperability Problem</span>

   If a client implements GSS-API mechanism X, potentially negotiated
   through a GSS-API mechanism Y, and the server also implements GSS-API
   mechanism X negotiated through a GSS-API mechanism Z, the
   authentication negotiation will fail.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/14.2.%20%20Security%20Problem"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-14.2" name="section-14.2">14.2</a>.  Security Problem</span>

   If a client's policy is to first prefer GSSAPI mechanism X, then non-
   GSSAPI mechanism Y, then GSSAPI mechanism Z, and if a server supports
   mechanisms Y and Z but not X, then if the client attempts to
   negotiate mechanism X by using a GSS-API mechanism that negotiates
   other mechanisms (such as Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation
   (SPNEGO) [<a href="rfc4178.html" title='"The Simple and Protected Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Negotiation Mechanism"'>RFC4178</a>]), it may end up using mechanism Z when it ideally
   should have used mechanism Y.  For this reason, the use of GSS-API
   mechanisms that negotiate other mechanisms is disallowed under GS2.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/14.3.%20%20Resolving%20the%20Problems"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-14.3" name="section-14.3">14.3</a>.  Resolving the Problems</span>

   GSS-API mechanisms that negotiate other mechanisms MUST NOT be used
   with the GS2 SASL mechanism.  Specifically, SPNEGO [<a href="rfc4178.html" title='"The Simple and Protected Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Negotiation Mechanism"'>RFC4178</a>] MUST NOT
   be used as a GS2 mechanism.  To make this easier for SASL
   implementations, we assign a symbolic SASL mechanism name to the
   SPNEGO GSS-API mechanism, "SPNEGO".  SASL client implementations MUST
   NOT choose the SPNEGO mechanism under any circumstances.

   The GSS_C_MA_MECH_NEGO attribute of GSS_Inquire_attrs_for_mech
   [<a href="rfc5587.html" title='"Extended Generic Security Service Mechanism Inquiry APIs"'>RFC5587</a>] can be used to identify such mechanisms.

   The IANA has registered a SASL mechanism family as per [<a href="rfc4422.html" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>]
   using the following information.

     Subject: Registration of SASL mechanism family GS2-*

     Note: Compare with the GSSAPI and GSS-SPNEGO mechanisms.

   The IANA is advised that SASL mechanism names starting with "GS2-"
   are reserved for SASL mechanisms that conform to this document.  The
   IANA has placed a statement to that effect in the SASL Mechanisms
   registry.

   The IANA is further advised that GS2 SASL mechanism names MUST NOT
   end in "-PLUS" except as a version of another mechanism name simply
   suffixed with "-PLUS".

   The SASL names for the Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism [<a href="rfc4121.html" title='"The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2"'>RFC4121</a>]
   [<a href="rfc1964.html" title='"The Kerberos Version 5 GSS-API Mechanism"'>RFC1964</a>] used via GS2 SHALL be "GS2-KRB5" and "GS2-KRB5-PLUS".

   The SASL names for the SPNEGO GSS-API mechanism used via GS2 SHALL be
   "SPNEGO" and "SPNEGO-PLUS".  As described in <a href="#section-14">Section 14</a>, the SASL
   "SPNEGO" and "SPNEGO-PLUS" MUST NOT be used.  These names are
   provided as a convenience for SASL library implementors.

   Security issues are also discussed throughout this memo.

   The security provided by a GS2 mechanism depends on the security of
   the GSS-API mechanism.  The GS2 mechanism family depends on channel
   binding support, so GSS-API mechanisms that do not support channel
   binding cannot be successfully used as SASL mechanisms via the GS2
   bridge.

   Because GS2 does not support security layers, it is strongly
   RECOMMENDED that channel binding to a secure external channel be
   used.  Successful channel binding eliminates the possibility of man-
   in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, provided that the external channel and
   its channel binding data are secure and that the GSS-API mechanism
   used is secure.  Authentication failure because of channel binding



<span class="grey">Josefsson &amp; Williams         Standards Track                   [Page 22]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-23" id="page-23" name="page-23"> </a>

   failure may indicate that an MITM attack was attempted, but note that
   a real MITM attacker would likely attempt to close the connection to
   the client or simulate network partition; thus, MITM attack detection
   is heuristic.

   Use of channel binding will also protect the SASL mechanism
   negotiation -- if there is no MITM, then the external secure channel
   will have protected the SASL mechanism negotiation.

   The channel binding data MAY be sent (by the actual GSS-API mechanism
   used) without confidentiality protection and knowledge of it is
   assumed to provide no advantage to an MITM (who can, in any case,
   compute the channel binding data independently).  If the external
   channel does not provide confidentiality protection and the GSS-API
   mechanism does not provide confidentiality protection for the channel
   binding data, then passive attackers (eavesdroppers) can recover the
   channel binding data, see [<a href="rfc5056.html" title='"On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure Channels"'>RFC5056</a>].

   When constructing the input_name_string for GSS_Import_name with the
   GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE name type, the client SHOULD NOT
   canonicalize the server's fully qualified domain name using an
   insecure or untrusted directory service, such as the Domain Name
   System [<a href="rfc1034.html" title='"Domain names - concepts and facilities"'>RFC1034</a>] without DNS Security (DNSSEC) [<a href="rfc4033.html" title='"DNS Security Introduction and Requirements"'>RFC4033</a>].

   SHA-1 is used to derive SASL mechanism names, but no traditional
   cryptographic properties are required -- the required property is
   that the truncated output for distinct inputs are different for
   practical input values.  GS2 does not use any other cryptographic
   algorithm.  Therefore, GS2 is "algorithm agile", or, as agile as the
   GSS-API mechanisms that are available for use in SASL applications
   via GS2.

   GS2 does not protect against downgrade attacks of channel binding
   types.  Negotiation of channel binding type was intentionally left
   out of scope for this document.

   The security considerations of SASL [<a href="rfc4422.html" title='"Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)"'>RFC4422</a>], the GSS-API [<a href="rfc2743.html" title='"Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2, Update 1"'>RFC2743</a>],
