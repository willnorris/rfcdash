STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This memo assigns instruction codes, defines object formats and
   object semantics for use with the High-Level Monitoring and Control
   Language, defined in <a href="rfc1023.html">RFC-1023</a>.

   This memo is provisional and the definitions are subject to change.
   Readers should confirm that they have the most recent version of the
   memo.

   The authors assume a working knowledge of the ISO data encoding
   standard, ASN.1, and a general understanding of the IP protocol
   suite.

   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

INTRODUCTION

   In other memos [RFC-1021, <a href="rfc1022.html">RFC-1022</a>] the authors have described a
   general system for monitoring and controlling network entities; this
   system is called the High-Level Entity Management System (HEMS).
   This system permits applications to read and write values in remote
   entities which support a simple query processor.

   In this memo we standardize the language instruction codes, the
   objects which can be read or written, and the meanings of any
   constants stored in the objects.  There are three parts to this
   standardization: (1) the assignment of an ASN.1 tag to each value,
   (2) the definition of the external representation of the value (e.g.,
   INTEGER, OCTETSTRING, etc.), and (3) the definition of the meaning,
   or semantics of a value (e.g., what types of packets a particular
   packet counter actually tracks).

   This definition is provisional, and the authors hope that it will be
   expanded and improved as the community becomes more experienced with
   HEMS.  Readers with suggestions for additional object definitions, or
   improved definitions are encouraged to contact the authors.

MESSAGE FORMATS

   All HEMS values are conveyed between applications and entities using
   the High-Level Entity Management Protocol (HEMP) specified in <a href="rfc1022.html">RFC-</a>
   <a href="rfc1022.html">1022</a>.  All values specified in this memo are passed in the data
   sections of HEMP messages.  For all message types, the data section
   is a SEQUENCE of objects.  For requests, these objects are operations
   and their operands.  Replies contain a sequence of objects retrieved
   by a request.  Events contain an initial event object followed by an
   optional number of objects related to the event.

   Messages conforming to this memo should set the link field in the
   HEMP CommonHeader to 1, to indicate version 1 of HEMS.  The
   resourceId field should be set to NULL.


CONTROL LANGUAGE INSTRUCTIONS

   The HEMS Monitoring and Control Language defines a suite of
   operations which the query processor must be able to perform.  These
   operations and their operands are ASN.1 objects which are passed to
   the query processor over a network connection.  The operations and
   operands are sent in postfix form (the operation follows the
   operands). Operands are pushed onto a stack and are processed when
   the operation is encountered.

   To ensure that operations are easily recognized in the input stream,
   they are all encoded in a single application-specific type.  This
   type is shown below.

               Operation ::= [APPLICATION 1] IMPLICIT INTEGER {
                       reserved(0), get(1) begin(2), end(3),
                       get-match(4), get-attributes(5),
                       get-attributes-match(6), get-range(7),
                       set(8), set-match(9)
                   }

   When the query processor encounters an Operation object it consults
   the value to determine which operation is to be done (e.g., GET).

GENERAL COMMENTS ON OBJECTS STORED IN ENTITIES

   The High-Level Monitoring and Control Language requires the object
   space to have a tree-shaped type space.  Locating a particular object
   requires identifying that section of the tree in which the object
   resides.  (A more detailed explanation of the scheme is given in
   <a href="rfc1023.html">RFC-1023</a>).

   This memo defines a universal type space.  A subset of this type
   space is expected to be an appropriate type space for any entity
   (e.g., a gateway or a multi-user host).  The type space is divided
   into required and optional portions.  Implementors should implement
   the required portion of the type space plus that part of the optional
   type space which is appropriate for their particular entity.

   One problem with defining a universal type space is that certain
   interesting objects are not universal, but are instead very machine
   specific (for example, status registers on specialized hardware).  To
   allow implementors to retrieve such implementation-specific objects
   using the HEMS system, a special APPLICATION type is reserved for
   non-standard values.

   Putting objects in ASN.1 form implies an ability to map to and from
   ASN.1 format.  One of the design goals of this system has been to
   minimize the amount of ASN.1 compilation required by the query
   processor to reduce the expense of processing queries at entities.
   (This implies a certain willingness to force the applications
   querying entities to be more powerful).  We expect that most of the
   complex mapping will be done when objects are read; most writable
   objects have a simple format (e.g., an INTEGER, or OCTETSTRING).  As
   a result, we have made a heavy use of the ASN.1 SET type, which
   allows values to be presented in any order.  Applications which
   require particular fields in an object may use the template structure
   to specify particular fields to be retrieved, but this still permits
   the query processor to return the fields in whatever order is
   convenient.

   In addition to ease the problems of ASN.1 compilation, query
   processors are not required to reduce an INTEGER to the minimum
   number of octets as specified in ASN.1.  Applications should be
   prepared to receive INTEGERs which have leading octets with all zeros
   or ones.

   More generally, a design goal of HEMS was to try to limit the data
   processing done at the entity, and to place the burden of data
   reduction on the querying application.  As a result, the objects
   presented here are typically counters, or values which the entity has
   to compute already.  Object definitions which require the entity to
   do data reduction are not supported, although consideration might be
   given to making them optionally available.

   Finally, HEMS is required to support access by multiple network
   management centers or applications.  This constraint has some
   important consequences.  First, the SET operation cannot be applied
   to any Counter, since changing the value of a Counter may impair data
   acquisition by other centers.  More generally, there are questions



<span class="grey">Partridge &amp; Trewitt                                             [Page 3]</span></pre>

   about competing or clashing SET requests from management centers.
   Currently HEMS does not provide any facilities for protecting against
   such requests.  If such facilities become necessary, the authors
   envision the enhancement of the object definitions to incorporate the
   idea of "owned" objects.


READING THE OBJECT DEFINITIONS

   Most of the rest of this memo is devoted to ennumerating the objects
   managed by the query processor.  Many of these objects are
   dictionaries, objects which reference other objects.  Defining
   dictionaries requires that we specify the class of objects they
   reference.

   Most significant objects, such as packet counts, reside at the leaves
   of the object data tree.  They need to be carefully defined to ensure
   that their meaning is consistent across all HEMS implementations.
   These values are defined using the following format:


   OBJECT:  This is the name of the object.

   Type:  This is the ASN.1 type of the object.

   Definition:  The meaning of the data the object contains.
           Implementations should ensure that their instance of
           the object fulfills this definition since an important
           feature of HEMS is that objects have consistent meaning
           across all machines.  It is better not to implement
           an object than to abuse its definition.

   Notes:  An optional section of the definition which is used
           to discuss issues not covered in other sections of
           this specification.

   Object Status:  An optional section of the definition which
           is used to indicate whether the object is required of all
           HEMS implementations, encouraged of HEMS implementations
           or simply considered useful.  Currently, there are four
           levels of status:

               Required:  The object is felt to provide critical
               information and must be included in a fully
               conforming HEMS implementation.

               Required On Condition:  The object is felt to
               provide critical information about an optional

               feature of an IP entity (for example, support of
               the Transmission Control Protocol).  The object
               is required if the feature is implemented in the
               entity.

               Encouraged:  The object is felt to provide very
               useful management information and implementors
               are encouraged to implement it.

               Defined:  The object may be useful and has been
               defined so that all implementations of the object
               are consistent.

           If the object status is not specified, the object should
           be considered required.  If the parent dictionary is optional,
           then the object should be considered required if the parent
           dictionary is supported.

   Operations on Object:  The definition of how each monitoring
           and control operation acts on the object.  Many operations
           have the same effect on almost all values, so some
           default definitions are presented here.  In the absence
           of an operation specification, implementors should use
           the default operations defined here.

           BEGIN:  The default is for BEGIN to be defined for
               dictionaries, and an error if performed on leaf
               objects in the tree.

           CREATE:  The default is that CREATE is undefined.

           DELETE:  The default is that DELETE is undefined.

           END:  END is a stack operation and is defined for all objects.
               Note that END may fail if there is no object on the
               stack.


           GET-ATTRIBUTES:  The default is that GET-ATTRIBUTES is
               defined on the contents of all dictionaries specified
               in this memo.  The text description attributes
               are optional for values defined in this memo, but
               are required for implementation-specific objects.
               Any descriptions of object listed in this memo should
               cite this memo.  GET-ATTRIBUTES must be supported on
               all entity-specific values.  GET-ATTRIBUTES
               returns a Attributes object, which is defined in
               the well-known types section below.

           GET-ATTRIBUTES-MATCH:  The default is that
               GET-ATTRIBUTES-MATCH is optionally defined on any
               object which supports GET-MATCH, and is an error
               otherwise.  The rules for attributes returned by
               GET-ATTRIBUTES-MATCH are the same as those for
               GET-ATTRIBUTES.

           GET:  The default definition of GET is to emit the operand
               specified is a leaf object, and if the operand is a
               dictionary, to recursively GET the entire dictionary and
               its subdictionaries.

           GET-MATCH:  Unless otherwise specified, GET-MATCH is not
               supported on an object.

           GET-RANGE:  Unless otherwise specified, GET-RANGE is not
               supported on an object.

           SET:  Unless otherwise specified, SET is not supported on an
               object.

           SET-MATCH:  Unless otherwise specified, SET-MATCH is not
               supported on an object.


ATTRIBUTES

   HEMS requires that remote applications be able to discover the
   meaning of an object by querying the entity in which the object is
   stored.  This is done through use of the GET-ATTRIBUTES operator,
   which causes an Attributes object to be returned to the application.
   The Attributes object is described below.

           Attributes ::= [APPLICATION 2] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
               tagASN1       [0] IMPLICIT INTEGER,
               valueFormat   [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>] IMPLICIT INTEGER,
               longDesc      [2] IMPLICIT IA5String OPTIONAL,
               shortDesc     [<a href="#ref-3" title=" [30] IMPLICIT NetbltValues OPTIONAL">3</a>] IMPLICIT IA5String OPTIONAL,
               unitsDesc     [4] IMPLICIT IA5String OPTIONAL,
               precision     [5] IMPLICIT INTEGER OPTIONAL,
               properties    [6] IMPLICIT BITSTRING OPTIONAL,
           }

   The meanings of the various attributes are given below.

           tagASN1:  The ASN.1 tag for this object.
               This attribute is required.

           valueFormat:  The underlying ASN.1 type of the object
               (e.g., SEQUENCE, or OCTETSTRING).  This attribute
               is required.

           longDesc:  A potentially lengthy text description which
               fully defines the object.  This attribute is optional
               for objects defined in this memo and required for
               entity-specific objects.

           shortDesc:  A short mnemonic string of less than 15 octets
               which is suitable for labelling the value on a display.
               This attribute is optional.

           unitsDesc:  A short string used for integer values to
               indicate the units in which the value is measured
               (e.g. "ms", "sec", "packets", etc).  This attribute
               is optional.

           precision:  For Counter objects, the value at which the
               Counter will roll-over.  Required for all Counter
               objects.

           properties:  A bitstring of boolean properties of the
               object.  If the bit is on, it has the given property.
               This attribute is optional.  The bits currently
               defined are:

                   0 -- If true, the difference between two values
                       of this object is significant. For example,
                       the changes in a packet count is always
                       significant, it always conveys information.
                       In this case, the 0 bit would be set.  On the
                       other hand, the difference between two readings
                       of a queue length may be meaningless.


IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFIC TYPES

   Each vendor or implementation specific value must be contained within
   an VendorSpecific object.  The format of the VendorSpecific object is
   shown below.

   Type:  VendorSpecific

            VendorSpecific ::= [APPLICATION 3] IMPLICIT SET of ANY

   For a detailed discussion of the need for this type, see <a href="rfc1023.html">RFC 1023</a>.

WELL-KNOWN TYPES

   There are some generally useful types which are defined across the
   system and are considered well-known.  These types support abstract
   notions that are frequently used in other definitions.

   TYPE: Error

           Error ::= [APPLICATION 0] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
               errorCode INTEGER,
               errorOffset INTEGER
               errorDescription IA5String,
           }

   The Error type is returned within reply messages when an error is
   countered.  The errorCode is a number specifying a general class of
   error.  The errorOffset is the octet in the query where the error was
   discovered.  Note that the query starts at the first octet (octet 0)
   of the HEMP data section.  The errorDescription is a text message
   explaining the error.  Note that the definition of this section is
   the same (except for the start of the offset) as that of the HEMP
   protocol error structure and the error codes have been selected to
   keep the code spaces distinct.  This is intended to ease the
   processing of error messages.  The defined errorCodes are:

               100 -- Any error not listed below.

               101 -- System error.  The query processor has failed
                   in some way.

               102 -- Format error.  An error has been detected in
                   the input stream.

               103 -- Stack error.  A stack overflow or underflow has
                   occurred.

               104 -- Instruction error.  The instruction is either
                   unknown, or not supported on the object to which
                   it has been applied.

               105 -- Operand error.  The wrong number of operands or
                   inappropriate operands have been given to an
                   instruction.






<span class="grey">Partridge &amp; Trewitt                                             [Page 8]</span></pre>

   TYPE:  Counter

       Counter ::= [APPLICATION 4] IMPLICIT INTEGER

   The Counter type is an unsigned integer which is defined to roll-over
   to 0 when incremented past a certain value.  (The roll-over point may
   be found by examining the attributes for the particular counter.)
   Counter sizes should be chosen such that the counters will not roll
   over more than once every 24 hours.

   TYPE:  InstructionGroup

       InstructionGroup ::= [APPLICATION 5] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE
           of ANY

   An InstructionGroup is an encapsulated sequence of operands and
   operations.  It allows applications to encode queries as objects.

   TYPE:  Histogram

       Histogram ::= SET of HistEntry

       HistEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
           histValue INTEGER,
           histCount Counter
       }

   A Histogram associates a count, histCount, with a numeric value,
   histValue.  No meaning is placed on the count or value by this
   definition.  Each HistEntry may represent a simple map (e.g.,
   histCount instances of histValue), or a more complex relationship
   (e.g., a count of all values between this histValue and the next
   lowest histValue in the Histogram).  The meaning of the particular
   Histogram is given in the object definition.

   TYPE: TrafficMatrix

       TrafficMatrix ::= SET of TrafficEntry

       TrafficEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
           src IpAddress,
           dst IpAddress,
           count Counter
       }

   A TrafficMatrix measures traffic observed between two IP addresses.
   Typically it is used to count packets flowing through a gateway.

   TYPE:  IpAddress

       IpAddress ::= OCTETSTRING

   The 4 octet IP address.  If the length of the string is less than 4
   then the missing octets are wildcarded.  A zero length string is a
   default address (e.g., for indicating default routes).


   TYPE: Fraction

       Fraction ::= INTEGER

   A Fraction is an integer representation of a fractional value.  It
   contains the numerator of a value as expressed over 256.  (For
   example dividing the Fraction by 256 gives the fractional value.)

   TYPE:  BootClock

       BootClock ::= INTEGER

   The time in milliseconds since the machine was last booted or reset.
   This value is always defined.

   TYPE:  localClock

       LocalClock ::= INTEGER

   The local system clock, measured in milliseconds since 00:00 1
   January 1900 UTC.  Assumed to be only a local estimate of the time.
   The value 0 is reserved for an uninitialized clock (For example, an
   uninitialized time-of-day chip.)


   TYPE:  NetClock

       NetClock ::= INTEGER

   A network synchronized clock, which is assumed to be synchronized
   across some part of a network.  The clock value is measured in
   milliseconds since 00:00 1 January 1900 UTC.  Specific information
   about the synchronization protocol is found in the system variable
   dictionary.  The value 0 is used to indicate an uninitialized clock.

   TYPE: TimeStamp

       TimeStamp ::= CHOICE {
           [0] BootClock



<span class="grey">Partridge &amp; Trewitt                                            [Page 10]</span></pre>

           [<a id="ref-1" name="ref-1">1</a>] localClock
           [2] NetClock
       }

   A TimeStamp, which was taken from the boot clock, system clock or the
   synchronized clock.  In general, a time of day is preferred to the
   time since boot, and a synchronized clock is preferred to an
   unsynchronized clock.  It is more useful to know that an event
   occurred at a particular time, than that it happened so many
   milliseconds after the machine booted.


OBJECT DEFINITIONS

The Root Dictionary

   In HEMS, all data is stored in dictionaries, where a dictionary is
   thought to represent a conceptual grouping of values.  The top-level
   dictionary is the root dictionary.  The form of the root dictionary
   for is shown below.

           RootDictionary ::= [APPLICATION 32] IMPLICIT SET {
               SystemVariables,
               EventControls OPTIONAL,
               Interfaces,
               IpNetworkLayer,
               IpRoutingTable,
               IpTransportLayer,
               IpApplications OPTIONAL
           }

The root dictionary is split into seven general dictionaries:

           - SystemVariables, which stores general system values such
           as the system clock, machine memory and system up/down
           status.

           - EventControls, which stores all objects necessary to
           observe and control the event generating mechanism in
           entities which support events.

           - interfaces, which contains all information on all
           the network interfaces and IP to physical address
           maps (ARP tables, X.25 Standard mappings, etc).

           - IpNetworkLayer, which contains information about the
           workings of the IP layer.  This includes information such
           as routing tables, general packet counts, and host-traffic



<span class="grey">Partridge &amp; Trewitt                                            [Page 11]</span></pre>

           matrices.

           - IpRoutingTable, which contains information on how the
           machine routes packets.  It proved more useful to segregate
           routing information than to keep it stored with the network
           layer data.

           - IpTransportLayer, which stores information on the transport
           protocols that the entity supports.

           - IpApplications, which may store information about various
           internet applications such as the domain system.  This
           section is not required of HEMS entities.

   The next several sections define the values stored in the five
   dictionaries.


The SystemVariables Dictionary

   The SystemVariables dictionary stores objects which are not strictly
   protocol, network, or application specific.  Such objects include
   values such as the machine load, clocks and the processor status.
   The form of the dictionary is shown below.

   SystemVariables ::= [APPLICATION 33] IMPLICIT SET {
       referenceClock   [0] IMPLICIT TimeStamp,
       netClockInfo     [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>] IMPLICIT SET OPTIONAL,
       processorLoad    [2] IMPLICIT INTEGER,
       entityState      [<a href="#ref-3" title=" [30] IMPLICIT NetbltValues OPTIONAL">3</a>] IMPLICIT INTEGER,
       kernelMemory     [4] IMPLICIT OCTETSTRING OPTIONAL,
       pktBuffers       [5] IMPLICIT INTEGER OPTIONAL,
       pktOctets        [6] IMPLICIT INTEGER OPTIONAL,
       pktBuffersFree   [7] IMPLICIT INTEGER OPTIONAL,
       pktOctetsFree    [8] IMPLICIT INTEGER OPTIONAL
       systemID         [9] IMPLICIT IA5STRING,
   }

   OBJECT:  SystemVariables

   Type:  SET

   Definition:  see above

   The objects in the dictionary are defined below.

   OBJECT:  referenceClock

   Type:  TimeStamp

   Definition:  The system clock used for placing timestamps on
       information.  Use of a NetClock is encouraged.

   Operations on Object:  Defaults.

   Notes:  Cross-network clock adjustment is best handled by a proper
           time synchronization protocol, not through the use of SET.


   OBJECT:  netClockInfo

   Type:  SET

   Definition:  Detailed information on the referenceClock if the
       referenceClock is a NetClock.  The format of this
       information is shown below.

       netClockInfo ::= [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>] IMPLICIT SET {
           estError INTEGER,
           refClockType INTEGER {
               unspecified(0), primary-reference(1),
               ntp-secondary-reference(2), secondary-reference(3),
               wristwatch(4)
             }
        }

        The estError is the estimated error in milliseconds.  The
        refClockType is a value indicating the type of reference
        clock consulted for network time  (the values are taken
        directly from the Network Time Protocol specification,
        <a href="rfc958.html">RFC-958</a>).

   Object Status:  Required if the referenceClock is a NetClock.


   OBJECT: processorLoad

   Type:  Fraction

   Definition:  A value, expressed as a Fraction, which indicates
           the current processing load on the entity.  A value of
           256 (= 1.0) is defined to be running at capacity.  It
           is recognized that this is an imprecise definition since
           capacity can be measured in several ways.  For example,
           a multiprocessor may still have plenty of capacity
           even if one processor is running at capacity,



<span class="grey">Partridge &amp; Trewitt                                            [Page 13]</span></pre>

           or it may be at capacity because that processor is the
           master processor and handles all context switching.
           The idea is for remote applications to be able to get some
           sense of the current workload on the entity.  Also note
           that the time scale of the measurement should be small.
           A load measure that averages over the past 10 seconds
           is acceptable but a load measure that averages over the
           past 10 minutes is not.  Implementors should chose some
           mapping between system load and this scale such that 256
           represents a machine under severe strain.  (Note that this

           rare cases.)

   OBJECT:  entityState

   Type:  INTEGER

   Definition: An object which indicates the system state.  There are
         several defined object values.  Some values are read-only and
         can only be read from the object.  Over values are write-only
         and will never be read from the object. Over values are
         write-only and will never be read from the object.The values
         are:

           The read-only values are:

                   (0) -- reserved.

                   (1) -- running.  The entity is up and running.

                   (2) -- testing.  The entity is running some sort of
                       diagnostics which may affect its network
                       operation.

           The write-only values are:

                   (0) -- reserved.

                   (1) -- reset the entity.

                   (2) -- reboot the entity. This value is assumed to
                       cause a more aggressive recycling of the system
                       than reset, though this need not be the case.

                   (3) -- halt the entity.  This value stops the
                       entity.  It assumed to prevent the entity from
                       operating until it is manually restarted.  (I.e.
                       the halt takes the machine off the network).

   Note:  The ability to change an entity's state requires very strong
      access controls.


   Operations on Object:  The defaults except as noted below.

       SET:  Optionally writes the value into the object.
             The message requesting the SET must be authenticated.

       SET-MATCH:  Optionally writes the value into the object
             if the current value is matched.

   OBJECT:  kernelMemory

   Type:  OCTETSTRING

   Definition:  A sequence of octets which represents the image of the
        kernel software running on the entity.  This facility is
        provided to allow remote network debugging.

        By kernel software, we mean that software which controls the
        operations and access to the hardware.  In particular, the kernel
        is expected to contain all network software up through the IP
        layer.

        Implementations which use lightweight processes or segmented
        images should consider providing some way to map their internal
        representation into a single contiguous stream of octets.

   Note:  Access control is required to read this object.

   Object Status:  Useful.

   Operations on Object:  The defaults except as noted below.

       GET-RANGE:  Emits the section of memory specified.

       GET:  Emits all of memory, but note that a GET on the system
           dictionary should *not* emit this object.

   OBJECT:  pktBuffers

   Type:  INTEGER

   Definition:  The total number of packet buffers in the entity.

   Object Status:  Required if the entity has a maximum number of
       buffers.  Note that most entities do have a limit (even if it

       that limit.

   OBJECT:  pktOctets

   Type:  INTEGER

   Definition:  The maximum number of octets that can be buffered in the
       entity at any one time.

   Object Status:  Required if the entity has a maximum number of octets
       it can buffer.  Note that most entities do have a limit and
       should return that limit.


   OBJECT:  pktBuffersFree

   Type:  INTEGER

   Definition:  The number of packet buffers currently available.
       Subtracting pktBuffersFree from pktBuffers should give the
       number of buffers in use.

   Object Status:  Required if there is a limit on the number of
       buffers.


   OBJECT: pktOctetsFree

   Type: INTEGER

   Definition:  The number of octets currently available including those
       not used in allocated buffers.  Subtracting this value from
       pktOctets should give the number of octets in use.

       This object can be used to track how well the entity buffers its
       data.

       Object Status:  Required if there is a limit on the number of
       octets that can be buffered.


   OBJECT:  systemID

   Type:  IA5STRING

   Definition:  The text identification of the entity.  This value
       should include the full name of the vendor, the type of system,

    Definition:  The set of all routing entries.  The RoutingEntry is
        defined below.


The IpRoutingTable Dictionary: The RoutingEntry

    The RoutingEntry contains all information on a particular route.
    The format of the structure is shown below.

            RoutingEntry ::= [0] IMPLICIT SET {
                routeMetric     [0] IMPLICIT INTEGER,
                routeDst        [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>] IMPLICIT IpAddress,

            }

    OBJECT:  RoutingEntry

    Type:  SET

    Definition:  See above.

    Operations on Object:  Defaults except as specified below.

        CREATE: Adds a new routing entry.  It should be confirmed
            that the entry is new.

        DELETE: Deletes a routing entry.

        GET-MATCH:  The match operator is defined on the routeDst
            field.  A match on an IpAddress is defined to be a
            search to find the route or routes which would be
            used to reach the IpAddress.  More than one route
            may be applicable, in which case all possible routes
            should be returned.

        SET-MATCH: Is optionally defined on the object.  A SET
            on an entire RoutingEntry replaces the entire entry
            with a new value.  Certain fields (indicated below)
            can also be changed using a SET-MATCH.

            The match operator is defined on the routeDst and
            routeTOS fields.  To SET a value, the match must be
            exact on the IP address (this is different from the

            search definition for GET-MATCH).

            Note that support of the operator on an entity
            which uses a dynamic routing protocol such as
            GGP or EGP will require close coordination with
            the routing protocol to ensure consistent data.
            (Arguably, this facility should not be supported
            on such machines).

    The definitions of the fields in the RoutingEntry are given below.


    OBJECT:  routeMetric

    Type:  INTEGER

    Definition: The routing metric on this route.  Note that the type of

    Definition:  see above.


    The definition of the objects in the tcpParam dictionary are given
    below.

    OBJECT:  tcpRtoA

    Type:  IA5String

    Definition:  The TCP retransmission timeout algorithm used.  The
        algorithm is expressed as one or more equations to generate
        a target value, "RTO[N]", which is the retransmission timeout
        for packet "N".  Expressions should use well understood
        symbols such as * for multiplication and / for division, and
        parentheses to indicate precedence.  Variables should begin
        with an upper case character.  Multiple equations should be
        separated by semi-colons.  Comments should be in braces (i.e.,
        {}).  Constants should begin with a lower case character.  In
        addition to "RTO[N]" the symbol "S[N]" is defined to mean the
        round-trip sample for packet N.  Using this syntax, the
        algorithm in <a href="rfc793.html">RFC-793</a> would be expressed as:

                RTO[N] = SRTT[N] * beta ;
                SRTT[N] = ( S[N-1] * alpha) + (SRTT[N-1] * (1 - alpha))

    Note:  The syntax probably needs to be refined so that it can be
       parsed and interpreted by a program.  This is left for future
       study.


    OBJECT:  tcpRtoParam

    Type:  SET of RtoParam

    Definition:  The list of the values of the constants used by the
        retransmission timeout algorithm.  The format of the RtoParam

        MTU.  (Some implementations have no constraints, but chose an
        MTU from external constraints such as the maximum MTU of the
        network interface in use.)


    OBJECT:  tcpMaxConn

    Type:  INTEGER

    Definition:  An optional value, which must be present if the entity
        has a limit on the total number of TCP connections it can support.

    Object Status:  Required if the entity sets limits.

    Note:  If the SET operation is defined, access control must be
        exercised.

    Operations on Object:  The defaults except as listed below:

        SET:  Optionally defined to change the value.  If the
            new value is less than the number of currently
            open connections, implementations are *not* required
            to close existing connections, but may not open
            any additional ones.


    OBJECT:  tcpMaxWindow

    Type:  INTEGER

    Definition:  An optional value, which must be present if the entity
        places a fixed upper limit on the size of any connection's TCP
        window (i.e., if the maximum window size is not per connection
        configurable).

    Object Status:  Required if the entity sets limits.

NOTES ON RETRIEVAL OF OBJECTS

     It is assumed in this system that the query processor is only one
     of many concurrently running processes on an entity, and that the
     operations of the other processes may affect the values of the
     objects managed by the query processor.  To permit this
     concurrency, the query processor is not required to keep the values
     frozen during the execution of a query.  As a result, related
     values may change during the course of the query's execution.
     Applications should be prepared for this possibility.

     In several places, specific mathematical relations between objects
     have been specified, for example, that object X minus object Y
     should yield some well-defined value.  Note that in many cases,
     objects X and Y are roll-over counters, in which case these
     relations are only valid modulo the precision of the counter.  This
     is acceptable.  The relationships are only intended to clarify the
     association between objects.


EVENTS

     In the remainder of this memo we present the format and definition
     of event messages which are unsolicited updates sent from entities
     to management centers.

     This section needs much further work.  The authors provide this
     section to illustrate how the trap mechanism works.  However, much
     more research must be done into the questions of what events need
     to be reported, and what information they must carry with them

     advice from the community on this subject.


Format of Event Messages

     Event messages have the same format as replies; they are a sequence
     of objects.  The only difference between a event message and a
     regular reply to a query is that the event message is labelled as a
     event in the HEMP message header and the first object in the event
     message is a special event leader describing the event.  All
     objects after the event message are standard objects stored by the
     entity which might be useful to a monitoring center in
     understanding the machine state which caused the event.  Each event
     has a certain number of objects that it must return.  Additional
     objects may be returned by loading instructions into the
     eventExecution buffer of the relevant eventEntry.

     The format of the event leader is shown below:

             EventLeader ::= [APPLICATION 1024] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
                 eventCode INTEGER,
                 eventIndex INTEGER,
                 eventThreshold INTEGER,
                 eventTime TimeStamp,
                 eventDescr IA5STRING
             }


     The eventCode is a number which indicates the type of event.  The
     eventCodes are defined below.

     The eventIndex is an implementation specific value.  It is
     considered good practice to make sure that a particular event is
     only generated in one place.  It may be the case that certain HEMS
     generic events (for example, "no buffer space") may be generated by
     more than one place in an entity's code.  To allow implementors and
     network managers to determine where the event is actually being
     generated, implementors should make sure that a distinct eventIndex
     is assigned to each location in the code that generates a
     particular event.

     The eventThreshold is the value of the event threshold when the
     event was sent.

     The eventTime indicates when the trap was generated.

     The eventDescr is a text string which describes the event.  This

     description should explain the general problem (e.g., "no buffer
     space") and may also, optionally, include additional information
     about why this particular event was generated (e.g., "could not
     send ICMP redirect").


Event Definitions

     The remainder of this memo presents a few generic events, which are
     presented for illustration only.  Implementors interested in
     supporting events should contact the authors to help work out a
     more comprehensive set of definitions.

     The format of the event definitions is:

     EVENT CODE:  The event code number.

     Definition:  Defines the event.

         Related Objects: The list of related objects which *must* be
         returned following the event header.  All objects should be
         returned as fully qualified objects (with ASN.1 codes tracing
         a complete path from the root object dictionary).  If no
         objects are specified, then no related objects are required.

     Event Status:  Events are either required of all conforming
             implementations, required if the entity supports a
             particular feature (e.g., TCP events) or optional.

     Notes: Any additional notes about the event.


List of Events


         The next few event codes are for system (as opposed to more
         network oriented) events.

         EVENT CODE:  0

         Definition:  Unused


         EVENT CODE:  1

         Definition:  The entity has rebooted.

         Related Objects:   An INTEGER which is the highest HEMP

             messageID reached by the trap system before the system
             crashed.

         EVENT CODE:  2

         Definition:  The entity is about to go into test mode.


         EVENT CODE:  3

         Definition:  The entity is about to reset.


         EVENT CODE:  4

         Definition:  The entity is about to reboot.


         EVENT CODE:  5

         Definition:  The entity is about to halt.


         EVENT CODE:  6

         Definition:  The system is close to depleting its packet buffer
             space.

         Event Status:  optional


         EVENT CODE:  7

         Definition:  The system has depleted its packet buffer space.


         EVENT CODE:  8

         Definition:  The system has depleted a non-packet buffer space.

         Note:  The two trap codes above do not deal neatly with
             systems which have multiple buffer pools, each of which
             may be depleted separately, with very different effects
             on the entity.


         The next set of event codes apply to events related to network
         interfaces.

         Related Objects:  The InterfaceData structure for the
             interface.

         The next set of event codes are used to report IP-level errors.


         EVENT CODE:  2048

         Definition:  Unable to route IP packet.


         EVENT CODE:  2049

         Definition:  Bad IP checksum.


         EVENT CODE:  2050

         Definition:  An IP packet with a bad header was received (for
             example, with a broadcast or multicast IP address as the
             source, or the wrong IP version number, or a header length
             which is too short).

AREAS FOR FURTHER STUDY

     There are several parts of this document that could use additional
     study.  Comments from readers are welcome.

     The whole event system needs thorough examination.  It is not clear
     that the event control mechanism strikes the proper balance between
     sufficient flexibility to allow monitoring centers to customize
     their event stream, and keeping the basic mechanism simple.
     Further, the problem of defining generic events for all entities is
     an immense task.  Finally, the system of appending required values
     after traps, followed by optional values read from the data tree
     feels a bit cumbersome.  It would be nice if all values were in the
     same data space.

     Several readers have suggested it might make more sense to keep TCP
     connection parameters on a per-connection basis rather than
     globally.

     The method for specifying the TCP round-trip time algorithm needs
     to be refined.  The expression syntax should be sufficiently
     general that all round-trip-time-related algorithms (e.g., those
     for time or routing protocols) can be expressed in it.

     Much more research could be done into what information needs to be
     gathered to effectively monitor a network.
