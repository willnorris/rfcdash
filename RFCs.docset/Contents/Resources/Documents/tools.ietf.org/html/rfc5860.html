<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   In the context of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP, see [<a href="#ref-9" title='"A Framework for MPLS in Transport Networks"'>9</a>] and [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile"'>1</a>]),
   the rationales for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
   are twofold as it can serve:

   o  as a network-oriented functionality, used by a transport network
      operator to monitor his network infrastructure and to implement
      internal mechanisms in order to enhance the general behavior and
      the level of performance of his network (e.g., protection
      mechanism in case of node or link failure).  As an example, fault
      localization is typically associated with this use case.

   o  as a service-oriented functionality, used by a transport service
      provider to monitor services offered to end customers in order to
      be able to react rapidly in case of a problem and to be able to
      verify some of the Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters (e.g.,
      using performance monitoring) negotiated with the end customers.
      Note that a transport service could be provided over several
      networks or administrative domains that may not all be owned and
      managed by the same transport service provider.

   More generally, OAM is an important and fundamental functionality in
   transport networks as it contributes to:

   o  the reduction of operational complexity and costs, by allowing for
      efficient and automatic detection, localization, and handling and
      diagnosis of defects, as well as by minimizing service
      interruptions and operational repair times.

   o  the enhancement of network availability, by ensuring that defects
      (for example, those resulting in misdirected customer traffic) and
      faults are detected, diagnosed, and dealt with before a customer
      reports the problem.

   o  meeting service and performance objectives, as the OAM
      functionality allows for SLA verification in a multi-maintenance

   This document lists architectural and functional requirements for the
   OAM functionality of MPLS-TP.  These requirements apply to
   pseudowires (PWs), Label Switched Paths (LSPs), and Sections.

   These requirements are derived from the set of requirements specified
   by ITU-T and published in the ITU-T Supplement Y.Sup4 [<a href="#ref-10" title='"ITU-T Y.1300-series: Supplement on transport requirements for T-MPLS OAM and considerations for the application of IETF MPLS technology"'>10</a>].

   By covering transport specificities, these requirements complement
   those identified in <a href="rfc4377.html">RFC 4377</a> [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Operations and Management (OAM) Requirements for Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Networks"'>11</a>]; yet, some requirements may be
   similar.

   This document only lists architectural and functional OAM
   requirements.  It does not detail the implications of their
   applicability to the various types (e.g., point-to-point, point-to-
   multipoint, unidirectional, bidirectional, etc.) of PWs, LSPs, and
   Sections.  Furthermore, this document does not provide requirements
   on how the protocol solution(s) should behave to achieve the
   functional objectives.  Please see [<a href="#ref-12" title='"MPLS-TP OAM Framework"'>12</a>] for further information.

   Note that the OAM functions identified in this document may be used
   for fault-management, performance-monitoring, and/or protection-
   switching applications.  For example, connectivity verification can
   be used for fault management by detecting failure conditions, but may
   also be used for performance monitoring through its contribution to
   the evaluation of performance metrics (e.g., unavailability time).
   Nevertheless, it is outside the scope of this document to specify
   which function should be used for which application.

   Note also that it is anticipated that implementers may wish to
   implement OAM message handling in hardware.  Although not a
   requirement, this fact could be taken as a design consideration.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>2</a>].
   Although this document is not a protocol specification, the use of
   this language clarifies the instructions to protocol designers
   producing solutions that satisfy the requirements set out in this
   document.

   In this document, we:

   o  refer to the inability of a function to perform a required action
      as a fault.  This does not include an inability due to preventive
      maintenance, lack of external resources, or planned actions.  See
      also ITU-T G.806 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Characteristics of transport equipment - Description methodology and generic functionality"'>3</a>].

   o  refer to the situation in which the density of anomalies has
      reached a level where the ability to perform a required function
      has been interrupted as a defect.  See also ITU-T G.806 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Characteristics of transport equipment - Description methodology and generic functionality"'>3</a>].

      an End Point.  Further, we refer to a Label Switching Router
      (LSR), for a given LSP, and to a PW Switching Provider Edge
      (S-PE), for a given PW, as an Intermediate Point.  This document
      does not make a distinction between End Points (e.g., source and
      destination) as it can be inferred from the context of the
      sentences.

   o  use the term "node" as a general reference to End Points and
      Intermediate Points.

   o  refer to both segment and concatenated segments as segments (see
      [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile"'>1</a>] for definitions relating to the term "segment" as well as for

   This section lists the requirements by which the OAM functionality of
   MPLS-TP should abide.

   The requirements listed below may be met by one or more OAM
   protocols; the definition or selection of these protocols is outside
   the scope of this document.

   <a href="rfc5654.html">RFC 5654</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Requirements of an MPLS Transport Profile"'>1</a>] states (Requirement #2) that the MPLS-TP design, SHOULD
   as far as reasonably possible, reuse existing MPLS standards.  This
   general requirement applies to MPLS-TP OAM.  MPLS-TP OAM is defined
   in this document through a set of functional requirements.  These
   requirements will be met by protocol solutions defined in other
   documents.  The way in which those protocols are operated and the way
   in which a network operator can control and use the MPLS-TP OAM
   functions SHOULD be as similar as possible to the mechanisms and
   techniques used to operate OAM in other transport technologies.

   The protocol solution(s) developed to meet the requirements
   identified in this document MUST at least be applicable to point-to-
   point bidirectional PWs, point-to-point co-routed bidirectional LSPs,
   and point-to-point bidirectional Sections.  <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a> provides
   additional information with regard to the applicability to point-to-
   point associated bidirectional LSPs, point-to-point unidirectional
   LSPs, and point-to-multipoint LSPs.

   The service emulated by a PW may span multiple domains.  An LSP may
   also span multiple domains.  The protocol solution(s) MUST be
   applicable to end-to-end and to segments.  More generally, it MUST be
   possible to operate OAM functions on a per-domain basis and across
   multiple domains.

   Since LSPs may be stacked, the protocol solution(s) MUST be
   applicable on any LSP, regardless of the label stack depth.
   Furthermore, it MUST be possible to estimate OAM fault and
   performance metrics of a single PW or LSP segment or of an aggregate
   of PW or LSP segments.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.2.%20%20Independence"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.2" name="section-2.1.2">2.1.2</a>.  Independence</span>

   The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the underlying
   tunneling or point-to-point technology or transmission media.

   The protocol solution(s) SHOULD be independent of the service a PW
   may emulate.

   Any OAM function operated on a PW, LSP, or Section SHOULD be
   independent of the OAM function(s) operated on a different PW, LSP,
   or Section.  In other words, only the OAM functions operated on a
   given LSP (for example) should be used to achieve the OAM objectives
   for that LSP.

   The protocol solution(s) MUST support the capability to be
   concurrently and independently operated end-to-end and on segments.
   Therefore, any OAM function applied to segment(s) of a PW or LSP
   SHOULD be independent of the OAM function(s) operated on the end-to-
   end PW or LSP.  It SHOULD also be possible to distinguish an OAM
   packet running over a segment of a PW or LSP from another OAM packet
   running on the end-to-end PW or LSP.

   Furthermore, any OAM function applied to segment(s) of a PW or LSP
   SHOULD be independent of the OAM function(s) applied to other
   segment(s) of the same PW or LSP.

      Note: Independence should not be understood in terms of isolation
      as there can be interactions between OAM functions operated, for
      example, on two different LSPs.

   OAM functions operate in the data plane.  OAM packets MUST run in-
   band; that is, OAM packets for a specific PW, LSP, or Section MUST
   follow the exact same data path as user traffic of that PW, LSP, or
   Section.  This is often referred to as fate sharing.

   It MUST be possible to discriminate user traffic from OAM packets.
   This includes a means to differentiate OAM packets from user traffic
   as well as the capability to apply specific treatment to OAM packets,
   at the nodes processing these OAM packets.

   As part of the design of OAM protocol solution(s) for MPLS-TP, a
   mechanism for enabling the encapsulation and differentiation of OAM
   messages on a PW, LSP, or Section, MUST be provided.  Such mechanism
   SHOULD also support the encapsulation and differentiation of existing
   IP/MPLS and PW OAM messages.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.4.%20%20OAM%20and%20IP%20Capabilities"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.4" name="section-2.1.4">2.1.4</a>.  OAM and IP Capabilities</span>

   There are environments where IP capabilities are present in the data
   plane.  IP/MPLS environments are examples of such environments.
   There are also environments where IP capabilities may not be present
   in the data plane.  MPLS-TP environments are examples of environments
   where IP capabilities might or might not be present.

      Note: Presence or absence of IP capabilities is deployment
      scenario dependent.

   It MUST be possible to deploy the OAM functionality in any of these
   environments.  As a result, it MUST be possible to operate OAM
   functions with or without relying on IP capabilities, and it MUST be
   possible to choose to make use of IP capabilities when these are
   present.

   Furthermore, the mechanism required for enabling the encapsulation
   and differentiation of OAM messages (see <a href="#section-2.1.3">Section 2.1.3</a>) MUST support
   the capability to differentiate OAM messages of an OAM function

   operated by relying on IP capabilities (e.g., using encapsulation in
   an IP header) from OAM messages of an OAM function operated without
   relying on any IP capability.

   Note that IP capabilities include the capability to form a standard
   IP header, to encapsulate a payload in an IP header, to parse and
   analyze the fields of an IP header, and to take actions based on the
   content of these fields.

   For certain functions, OAM messages need to incorporate
   identification information (e.g., of source and/or destination
   nodes).  The protocol solution(s) MUST at least support
   identification information in the form of an IP addressing structure
   and MUST also be extensible to support additional identification
   schemes.

   It is REQUIRED that OAM interoperability is achieved between distinct
   domains materializing the environments described in <a href="#section-2.1.4">Section 2.1.4</a>.
   It is also REQUIRED that the first two requirements of <a href="#section-2.1.4">Section 2.1.4</a>
   still hold and MUST still be met when interoperability is achieved.

   When MPLS-TP is run with IP routing and forwarding capabilities, it
   MUST be possible to operate any of the existing IP/MPLS and PW OAM
   protocols (e.g., LSP-Ping [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) Data Plane Failures"'>4</a>], MPLS-BFD [<a href="#ref-13" title='"BFD For MPLS LSPs"'>13</a>], VCCV [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV): A Control Channel for Pseudowires"'>5</a>], and VCCV-BFD

   OAM functions MUST operate and be configurable even in the absence of
   a control plane.  Conversely, it SHOULD be possible to configure as
   well as enable/disable the capability to operate OAM functions as
   part of connectivity management, and it SHOULD also be possible to
   configure as well as enable/disable the capability to operate OAM
   functions after connectivity has been established.

   In the latter case, the customer MUST NOT perceive service
   degradation as a result of OAM enabling/disabling.  Ideally, OAM
   enabling/disabling should take place without introducing any customer
   impairments (e.g., no customer packet losses).  Procedures aimed to
   prevent any traffic impairment MUST be defined for the enabling/
   disabling of OAM functions.

   Means for configuring OAM functions and for connectivity management
   are outside the scope of this document.

   Hereafter are listed the required functionalities composing the
   MPLS-TP OAM toolset.  The list may not be exhaustive and as such the
   OAM mechanisms developed in support of the identified requirements
   SHALL be extensible and thus SHALL NOT preclude the definition of
   additional OAM functionalities, in the future.

   The design of OAM mechanisms for MPLS-TP, MUST allow for the ability
   to support experimental OAM functions.  These functions MUST be
   disabled by default.

   The use of any OAM function MUST be optional and it MUST be possible
   to select the set of OAM function(s) to use on any PW, LSP, or
   Section.

   It is RECOMMENDED that any protocol solution, meeting one or more
   functional requirement(s), be the same for PWs, LSPs, and Sections.

   It is RECOMMENDED that any protocol solution, meeting one or more
   functional requirement(s), effectively provides a fully featured
   function; that is, a function that is applicable to all the cases
   identified for that functionality.  In that context, protocol
   solution(s) MUST state their applicability.

   Unless otherwise stated, the OAM functionalities MUST NOT rely on
   user traffic; that is, only OAM messages MUST be used to achieve the
   objectives.

   For the on-demand OAM functions, the result of which may vary
   depending on packet size, it SHOULD be possible to perform these
   functions using different packet sizes.

   If a defect or fault occurs on a PW, LSP, or Section, mechanisms MUST
   be provided to detect it, diagnose it, localize it, and notify the
   appropriate nodes.  Mechanisms SHOULD exist such that corrective
   actions can be taken.

   Furthermore, mechanisms MUST be available for a service provider to
   be aware of a fault or defect affecting the service(s) he provides,
   even if the fault or defect is located outside of his domain.

   Protocol solution(s) developed to meet these requirements may rely on
   information exchange.  Information exchange between various nodes
   involved in the operation of an OAM function SHOULD be reliable such
   that, for example, defects or faults are properly detected or that

   diagnostic test consists of performing a loop-back function at a node
   such that all OAM and data traffic are looped back to the originating

   Based on the tunneling capabilities of MPLS, there are cases where
   Intermediate Point(s) of a PW or of an LSP coincide with End Point(s)
   of another LSP on which the former is mapped/tunneled.  Further, it
   may happen that the tunnel LSP is out of service as a result of a
   lock action on that tunnel LSP.  By means outside of the scope of
   this document, the Intermediate Point(s) of the PW or LSP may be
   aware of this condition.  The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide a
   function to enable an Intermediate Point of a PW or LSP to report, to
   an End Point of that same PW or LSP, a lock condition indirectly
   affecting that PW or LSP.

   This function SHOULD be performed proactively.

   This function SHOULD be performed between Intermediate Points and End
   Points of PWs and LSPs.

   The MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST provide a function to enable the
   quantification of the one-way, and if appropriate, the two-way, delay
   of a PW, LSP, or Section.

   o  The one-way delay is defined in [<a href="#ref-7" title='"A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM"'>7</a>] to be the time elapsed from
      the start of transmission of the first bit of a packet by an End
      Point until the reception of the last bit of that packet by the
      other End Point.

   o  The two-way delay is defined in [<a href="#ref-8" title='"A Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM"'>8</a>] to be the time elapsed from
      the start of transmission of the first bit of a packet by an End
      Point until the reception of the last bit of that packet by the
      same End Point.

   Two-way delay may be quantified using data traffic loopback at the
   remote End Point of the PW, LSP, or Section (see <a href="#section-2.2.5">Section 2.2.5</a>).

   Accurate quantification of one-way delay may require clock
   synchronization, the means for which are outside the scope of this
   document.

   This function SHOULD be performed on-demand and MAY be performed
   proactively.

   This function SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs,
   and Sections.

   A mechanism (e.g., rate limiting) MUST be provided to prevent OAM
   packets from causing congestion in the Packet Switched Network.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document, in itself, does not imply any security consideration
   but OAM, as such, is subject to several security considerations.  OAM
   messages can reveal sensitive information such as passwords,
   performance data and details about, e.g., the network topology.

   The nature of OAM therefore suggests having some form of
   authentication, authorization, and encryption in place.  This will
   prevent unauthorized access to MPLS-TP equipment and it will prevent
   third parties from learning about sensitive information about the
   transport network.

   OAM systems (network management stations) SHOULD be designed such
   that OAM functions cannot be accessed without authorization.

   OAM protocol solutions MUST include the facility for OAM messages to
   authenticated to prove their origin and to make sure that they are
   destined for the receiving node.  The use of such facilities MUST be
   configurable.

   An OAM packet received over a PW, LSP, or Section MUST NOT be
   forwarded beyond the End Point of that PW, LSP, or Section, so as to
   avoid that the OAM packet leaves the current administrative domain.
