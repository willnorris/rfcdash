<meta content="This note defines an extension of the Selective Acknowledgement (SACK)
Option [RFC2018] for TCP. RFC 2018 specified the use of the SACK
option for acknowledging out-of-sequence data not covered by TCP's
cumulative acknowledgement field. This note extends RFC 2018 by
specifying the use of the SACK option for acknowledging duplicate
packets. This note suggests that when duplicate packets are received,
the first block of the SACK option field can be used to report the
sequence numbers of the packet that triggered the acknowledgement.
This extension to the SACK option allows the TCP sender to infer the
order of packets received at the receiver, allowing the sender to
infer when it has unnecessarily retransmitted a packet. A TCP sender
could then use this information for more robust operation in an
environment of reordered packets, ACK loss, packet replication, and/or
early retransmit timeouts." name="DC.Description.Abstract"/>

Abstract

   This note defines an extension of the Selective Acknowledgement
   (SACK) Option [<a href="rfc2018.html" title='"TCP Selective Acknowledgement Options"'>RFC2018</a>] for TCP.  <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a> specified the use of the
   SACK option for acknowledging out-of-sequence data not covered by
   TCP's cumulative acknowledgement field.  This note extends <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a>
   by specifying the use of the SACK option for acknowledging duplicate
   packets.  This note suggests that when duplicate packets are
   received, the first block of the SACK option field can be used to
   report the sequence numbers of the packet that triggered the
   acknowledgement.  This extension to the SACK option allows the TCP
   sender to infer the order of packets received at the receiver,
   allowing the sender to infer when it has unnecessarily retransmitted
   a packet.  A TCP sender could then use this information for more
   robust operation in an environment of reordered packets [<a href="#ref-BPS99" title="and N. Shectman">BPS99</a>], ACK
   loss, packet replication, and/or early retransmit timeouts.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Introduction</span>

   The Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) option defined in <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a> is
   used by the TCP data receiver to acknowledge non-contiguous blocks of
   data not covered by the Cumulative Acknowledgement field.  However,
   <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a> does not specify the use of the SACK option when duplicate
   segments are received.  This note specifies the use of the SACK
   option when acknowledging the receipt of a duplicate packet [<a href="#ref-F99" title='"http://www.aciri.org/floyd/notes/TCP_Feb99.email"'>F99</a>].
   We use the term D-SACK (for duplicate-SACK) to refer to a SACK block
   that reports a duplicate segment.

   This document does not make any changes to TCP's use of the
   cumulative acknowledgement field, or to the TCP receiver's decision
   of *when* to send an acknowledgement packet.  This document only
   concerns the contents of the SACK option when an acknowledgement is
   sent.

   This extension is compatible with current implementations of the SACK
   option in TCP.  That is, if one of the TCP end-nodes does not
   implement this D-SACK extension and the other TCP end-node does, we
   believe that this use of the D-SACK extension by one of the end nodes
   will not introduce problems.

   The use of D-SACK does not require separate negotiation between a TCP
   sender and receiver that have already negotiated SACK capability.
   The absence of separate negotiation for D-SACK means that the TCP
   receiver could send D-SACK blocks when the TCP sender does not
   understand this extension to SACK.  In this case, the TCP sender will
   simply discard any D-SACK blocks, and process the other SACK blocks
   in the SACK option field as it normally would.

   The SACK option as defined in <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a> is as follows:

                            +--------+--------+
                            | Kind=5 | Length |
          +--------+--------+--------+--------+
          |      Left Edge of 1st Block       |
          +--------+--------+--------+--------+
          |      Right Edge of 1st Block      |
          +--------+--------+--------+--------+
          |                                   |
          /            . . .                  /
          |                                   |
          +--------+--------+--------+--------+
          |      Left Edge of nth Block       |
          +--------+--------+--------+--------+
          |      Right Edge of nth Block      |
          +--------+--------+--------+--------+

   The Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) option in the TCP header
   contains a number of SACK blocks, where each block specifies the left
   and right edge of a block of data received at the TCP receiver.  In
   particular, a block represents a contiguous sequence space of data
   received and queued at the receiver, where the "left edge" of the
   block is the first sequence number of the block, and the "right edge"
   is the sequence number immediately following the last sequence number
   of the block.

   <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a> implies that the first SACK block specify the segment that
   triggered the acknowledgement.  From <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a>, when the data receiver
   chooses to send a SACK option, "the first SACK block ... MUST specify
   the contiguous block of data containing the segment which triggered
   this ACK, unless that segment advanced the Acknowledgment Number
   field in the header."

   However, <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a> does not address the use of the SACK option when
   acknowledging a duplicate segment.  For example, <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a> specifies
   that "each block represents received bytes of data that are
   contiguous and isolated".  <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a> further specifies that "if sent
   at all, SACK options SHOULD be included in all ACKs which do not ACK
   the highest sequence number in the data receiver's queue."  <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a>
   does not specify the use of the SACK option when a duplicate segment
   is received, and the cumulative acknowledgement field in the ACK
   acknowledges all of the data in the data receiver's queue.

   the sequence numbers for the duplicate segment that triggers the
   acknowledgement.  If the duplicate segment is part of a larger block
   of non-contiguous data in the receiver's data queue, then the
   following SACK block should be used to specify this larger block.
   Additional SACK blocks can be used to specify additional non-
   contiguous blocks of data, as specified in <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a>.

   The guidelines for reporting duplicate segments are summarized below:

   (1) A D-SACK block is only used to report a duplicate contiguous
   sequence of data received by the receiver in the most recent packet.

   (2) Each duplicate contiguous sequence of data received is reported
   in at most one D-SACK block.  (I.e., the receiver sends two identical
   D-SACK blocks in subsequent packets only if the receiver receives two
   duplicate segments.)

   (3) The left edge of the D-SACK block specifies the first sequence
   number of the duplicate contiguous sequence, and the right edge of
   the D-SACK block specifies the sequence number immediately following
   the last sequence in the duplicate contiguous sequence.

   (4) If the D-SACK block reports a duplicate contiguous sequence from
   a (possibly larger) block of data in the receiver's data queue above
   the cumulative acknowledgement, then the second SACK block in that
   SACK option should specify that (possibly larger) block of data.

   (5) Following the SACK blocks described above for reporting duplicate
   segments, additional SACK blocks can be used for reporting additional
   blocks of data, as specified in <a href="rfc2018.html">RFC 2018</a>.

   Note that because each duplicate segment is reported in only one ACK
   packet, information about that duplicate segment will be lost if that
   ACK packet is dropped in the network.

   We illustrate these guidelines with three examples.  In each example,
   we assume that the data receiver has first received eight segments of
   500 bytes each, and has sent an acknowledgement with the cumulative
   acknowledgement field set to 4000 (assuming the first sequence number
   is zero).  The D-SACK block is underlined in each example.

   It may be possible that a sender transmits a packet that includes one
   or more duplicate sub-segments--that is, only part but not all of the
   transmitted packet has already arrived at the receiver.  This can
   occur when the size of the sender's transmitted segments increases,
   which can occur when the PMTU increases in the middle of a TCP
   session, for example.  The guidelines in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> above apply to
   reporting partial as well as full duplicate segments.  This section
   gives examples of these guidelines when reporting partial duplicate
   segments.

   When the SACK option is used for reporting partial duplicate
   segments, the first D-SACK block reports the first duplicate sub-
   segment.  If the data packet being acknowledged contains multiple
   partial duplicate sub-segments, then only the first such duplicate
   sub-segment is reported in the SACK option.  We illustrate this with
   the examples below.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.1.%20%20Example%204%3A"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1" name="section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Example 4:  </span>Reporting a single duplicate subsegment.

   The sender increases the packet size from 500 bytes to 1000 bytes.
   The receiver subsequently receives a 1000-byte packet containing one
   500-byte subsegment that has already been received and one which has
   not.  The receiver reports only the already received subsegment using
   a single D-SACK block.

   <a href="rfc1323.html">RFC 1323</a> [<a href="rfc1323.html" title='"TCP Extensions for High Performance"'>RFC1323</a>] specifies an algorithm for Protection Against
   Wrapped Sequence Numbers (PAWS).  PAWS gives a method for
   distinguishing between sequence numbers for new data, and sequence
   numbers from a previous cycle through the sequence number space.
   Duplicate segments might be detected by PAWS as belonging to a
   previous cycle through the sequence number space.

   <a href="rfc1323.html">RFC 1323</a> specifies that for such packets, the receiver should do the
   following:

      Send an acknowledgement in reply as specified in <a href="rfc793.html">RFC 793</a> page 69,
      and drop the segment.

   Since PAWS still requires sending an ACK, there is no harmful
   interaction between PAWS and the use of D-SACK.  The D-SACK block can
   be included in the SACK option of the ACK, as outlined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>,
   independently of the use of PAWS by the TCP receiver, and
   independently of the determination by PAWS of the validity or
   invalidity of the data segment.

   TCP senders receiving D-SACK blocks should be aware that a segment
   reported as a duplicate segment could possibly have been from a prior
   cycle through the sequence number space.  This is independent of the
   use of PAWS by the TCP data receiver.  We do not anticipate that this
   will present significant problems for senders using D-SACK
   information.

   This extension to the SACK option enables the receiver to accurately
   report the reception of duplicate data.  Because each receipt of a
   duplicate packet is reported in only one ACK packet, the loss of a
   single ACK can prevent this information from reaching the sender.  In
   addition, we note that the sender can not necessarily trust the
   receiver to send it accurate information [<a href="#ref-SCWA99" title='"http://www.acm.org/sigcomm/ccr/archive/ccr-toc/ccr-toc- 99.html"'>SCWA99</a>].

   In order for the sender to check that the first (D)SACK block of an
   acknowledgement in fact acknowledges duplicate data, the sender
   should compare the sequence space in the first SACK block to the
   cumulative ACK which is carried IN THE SAME PACKET.  If the SACK
   sequence space is less than this cumulative ACK, it is an indication
   that the segment identified by the SACK block has been received more
   than once by the receiver.  An implementation MUST NOT compare the
   sequence space in the SACK block to the TCP state variable snd.una
   (which carries the total cumulative ACK), as this may result in the
   wrong conclusion if ACK packets are reordered.

   If the sequence space in the first SACK block is greater than the
   cumulative ACK, then the sender next compares the sequence space in
   the first SACK block with the sequence space in the second SACK
   block, if there is one.  This comparison can determine if the first
   SACK block is reporting duplicate data that lies above the cumulative
   ACK.

   TCP implementations which follow <a href="rfc2581.html">RFC 2581</a> [<a href="rfc2581.html" title='"TCP Congestion Control"'>RFC2581</a>] could see
   duplicate packets in each of the following four situations.  This
   document does not specify what action a TCP implementation should
   take in these cases.  The extension to the SACK option simply enables
   the sender to detect each of these cases.  Note that these four
   conditions are not an exhaustive list of possible cases for duplicate
   packets, but are representative of the most common/likely cases.
   Subsequent documents will describe experimental proposals for sender
   responses to the detection of unnecessary retransmits due to
   reordering, lost ACKS, or early retransmit timeouts.

   If a packet is replicated in the network, this extension to the SACK
   option can identify this.  For example:

             Transmitted    Received    ACK Sent
             Segment        Segment     (Including SACK Blocks)

             500-999        500-999     1000
             1000-1499      1000-1499   1500
                            (replicated)
                            1000-1499   1500, SACK=1000-1500
                                                   ---------

   In this case, the second packet was replicated in the network.  An
   ACK containing a D-SACK block which is lower than its ACK field and
   is not identical to a previously retransmitted segment is indicative
   of a replication by the network.

   WITHOUT D-SACK:

   If D-SACK was not used and the last ACK was piggybacked on a data
   packet, the sender would not know that a packet had been replicated
   in the network.  If D-SACK was not used and neither of the last two
   ACKs was piggybacked on a data packet, then the sender could
   reasonably infer that either some data packet *or* the final ACK
   packet had been replicated in the network.  The receipt of the D-SACK
   packet gives the sender positive knowledge that this data packet was
   replicated in the network (assuming that the receiver is not lying).

   RESEARCH ISSUES:

   The current SACK option already allows the sender to identify
   duplicate ACKs that do not acknowledge new data, but the D-SACK
   option gives the sender a stronger basis for inferring that a
   duplicate ACK does not acknowledge new data.  The knowledge that a
   duplicate ACK does not acknowledge new data allows the sender to
   refrain from using that duplicate ACKs to infer packet loss (e.g.,
   Fast Retransmit) or to send more data (e.g., Fast Recovery).

   If packets are reordered in the network such that a segment arrives
   more than 3 packets out of order, TCP's Fast Retransmit algorithm
   will retransmit the out-of-order packet.  An example of this is shown
   below:

             Transmitted    Received    ACK Sent
             Segment        Segment     (Including SACK Blocks)

             500-999        500-999     1000
             1000-1499      (delayed)
             1500-1999      1500-1999   1000, SACK=1500-2000
             2000-2499      2000-2499   1000, SACK=1500-2500
             2500-2999      2500-2999   1000, SACK=1500-3000
             1000-1499      1000-1499   3000
                            1000-1499   3000, SACK=1000-1500
                                                   ---------

   In this case, an ACK containing a SACK block which is lower than its
   ACK field and identical to a previously retransmitted segment is
   indicative of a significant reordering followed by a false
   (unnecessary) retransmission.

   WITHOUT D-SACK:

   With the use of D-SACK illustrated above, the sender knows that
   either the first transmission of segment 1000-1499 was delayed in the
   network, or the first transmission of segment 1000-1499 was dropped
   and the second transmission of segment 1000-1499 was duplicated.
   Given that no other segments have been duplicated in the network,
   this second option can be considered unlikely.

   Without the use of D-SACK, the sender would only know that either the
   first transmission of segment 1000-1499 was delayed in the network,
   or that either one of the data segments or the final ACK was
   duplicated in the network.  Thus, the use of D-SACK allows the sender
   to more reliably infer that the first transmission of segment
   1000-1499 was not dropped.

   detect an unnecessary retransmit with the use of the timestamp
   option.  [<a href="#ref-LK00" title='"http://www.acm.org/sigcomm/ccr/archive/ccr-toc/ccr- toc-2000.html"'>LK00</a>] proposes a timestamp-based algorithm that minimizes
   the penalty for an unnecessary retransmit.  [<a href="#ref-AP99" title='"http://www.acm.org/sigcomm/sigcomm99/papers/session7- 3.html"'>AP99</a>] proposes a
   heuristic for detecting an unnecessary retransmit in an environment
   with neither timestamps nor SACK.  [<a href="#ref-L99" title='"http://iceberg.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/Ludwig- FlowAdaptive/"'>L99</a>] also proposes a two-bit
   field as an alternate to the timestamp option for unambiguously
   marking the first three retransmissions of a packet.  A similar idea
   was proposed in [<a href="#ref-ISO8073" title="Internation Standard ISO/IEC 8073">ISO8073</a>].

   RESEARCH ISSUES:

   The use of D-SACK allows the sender to detect some cases (e.g., when
   no ACK packets have been lost) when a a Fast Retransmit was due to
   packet reordering instead of packet loss.  This allows the TCP sender

   to adjust the duplicate acknowledgment threshold, to prevent such
   unnecessary Fast Retransmits in the future.  Coupled with this, when
   the sender determines, after the fact, that it has made an
   unnecessary window reduction, the sender has the option of "undoing"
   that reduction in the congestion window by resetting ssthresh to the
   value of the old congestion window, and slow-starting until the
   congestion window has reached that point.

   Any proposal for "undoing" a reduction in the congestion window would
   have to address the possibility that the TCP receiver could be lying
   in its reports of received packets [<a href="#ref-SCWA99" title='"http://www.acm.org/sigcomm/ccr/archive/ccr-toc/ccr-toc- 99.html"'>SCWA99</a>].

   If an entire window of ACKs is lost, a timeout will result.  An
   example of this is given below:

             Transmitted    Received    ACK Sent
             Segment        Segment     (Including SACK Blocks)

             500-999        500-999     1000 (ACK dropped)
             1000-1499      1000-1499   1500 (ACK dropped)
             1500-1999      1500-1999   2000 (ACK dropped)
             2000-2499      2000-2499   2500 (ACK dropped)
             (timeout)
             500-999        500-999     2500, SACK=500-1000
                                                   --------

   In this case, all of the ACKs are dropped, resulting in a timeout.
   This condition can be identified because the first ACK received
   following the timeout carries a D-SACK block indicating duplicate
   data was received.

   WITHOUT D-SACK:

   Without the use of D-SACK, the sender in this case would be unable to
   decide that no data packets has been dropped.

   RESEARCH ISSUES:

   For a TCP that implements some form of ACK congestion control
   [<a href="#ref-BPK97" title='"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~padmanab/ index.html#Publications"'>BPK97</a>], this ability to distinguish between dropped data packets and
   dropped ACK packets would be particularly useful.  In this case, the
   connection could implement congestion control for the return (ACK)
   path independently from the congestion control on the forward (data)
   path.

   If the sender's RTO is too short, an early retransmission timeout can
   occur when no packets have in fact been dropped in the network.  An
   example of this is given below:

             Transmitted    Received    ACK Sent
             Segment        Segment     (Including SACK Blocks)

             500-999        (delayed)
             1000-1499      (delayed)
             1500-1999      (delayed)
             2000-2499      (delayed)
             (timeout)
             500-999        (delayed)
                            500-999     1000
             1000-1499      (delayed)
                            1000-1499   1500
             ...
                            1500-1999   2000
                            2000-2499   2500
                            500-999     2500, SACK=500-1000
                                                   --------
                            1000-1499   2500, SACK=1000-1500
                                                   ---------
                            ...

   In this case, the first packet is retransmitted following the
   timeout.  Subsequently, the original window of packets arrives at the
   receiver, resulting in ACKs for these segments.  Following this, the
   retransmissions of these segments arrive, resulting in ACKs carrying
   SACK blocks which identify the duplicate segments.

   This can be identified as an early retransmission timeout because the
   ACK for byte 1000 is received after the timeout with no SACK
   information, followed by an ACK which carries SACK information (500-
   999) indicating that the retransmitted segment had already been
   received.

   WITHOUT D-SACK:

   If D-SACK was not used and one of the duplicate ACKs was piggybacked
   on a data packet, the sender would not know how many duplicate
   packets had been received.  If D-SACK was not used and none of the
   duplicate ACKs were piggybacked on a data packet, then the sender
   would have sent N duplicate packets, for some N, and received N
   duplicate ACKs.  In this case, the sender could reasonably infer that

   some data or ACK packet had been replicated in the network, or that
   an early retransmission timeout had occurred (or that the receiver is
   lying).

   RESEARCH ISSUES:

   After the sender determines that an unnecessary (i.e., early)
   retransmit timeout has occurred, the sender could adjust parameters
   for setting the RTO, to prevent more unnecessary retransmit timeouts.
   Coupled with this, when the sender determines, after the fact, that
   it has made an unnecessary window reduction, the sender has the
   option of "undoing" that reduction in the congestion window.
