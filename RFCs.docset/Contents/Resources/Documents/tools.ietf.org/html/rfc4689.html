Abstract

   This document describes terminology for the benchmarking of devices
   that implement traffic control using packet classification based on
   defined criteria.  The terminology is to be applied to measurements
   made on the data plane to evaluate IP traffic control mechanisms.
   Rules for packet classification can be based on any field in the IP
   header, such as the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), or any
   field in the packet payload, such as port number.

   New terminology is needed because most existing measurements assume
   the absence of congestion and only a single per-hop behavior.  This
   document introduces several new terms that will allow measurements to
   be taken during periods of congestion.

   Another key difference from existing terminology is the definition of
   measurements as observed on egress and ingress of a device/system
   under test.  Again, the existence of congestion requires the addition
   of egress measurements, as well as of those taken on ingress; without
   observing traffic leaving a device/system, it is not possible to say
   whether traffic-control mechanisms effectively dealt with congestion.

   The principal measurements introduced in this document are vectors
   for rate, delay, and jitter, all of which can be observed with or
   without congestion of the Device Under Test (DUT)/System Under Test
   (SUT).  This document describes only those terms relevant to
   measuring behavior of a DUT or SUT at the egress during periods of
   congestion.  End-to-end and service-level measurements are beyond the
   scope of this document.

   Definition:
      Selection of packets according to defined rules.

   Discussion:
      Classification determines the per-hop behaviors and traffic
      conditioning functions, such as shaping and dropping, that are to
      be applied to the packet.

      Classification of packets can be based on the DS field or IP
      Precedence in the packet header.  Classification can be based on
      other IP header fields, such as IP Source Address (SA),
      Destination Address (DA), and protocol, or on fields in the packet
      payload, such as port number.  Classification can also be based on
      ingress interface.  It is possible to base classification on
      Multi-Field (MF) criteria such as IP source and destination
      addresses, protocol, and port number.  For further discussion of
      packet classification and its network applications, see [<a href="#ref-Bl98" title='"An Architecture for Differentiated Service"'>Bl98</a>].

   Definition:
      The set of all DS Code-points or IP precedence values used during
      the test duration.

   Discussion:
      Describes all the code-point markings associated with packets that
      are input to the DUT/SUT.  For each entry in the codepoint set,
      there are associated vectors describing the rate of traffic,
      delay, loss, or jitter containing that particular DSCP or IP
      precedence value.

      The treatment that a packet belonging to a particular code-point
      gets is subject to the DUT classifying packets to map to the
      correct PHB.  Moreover, the forwarding treatment in general is
      also dependent on the complete set of offered vectors.

   Definition:
      A condition in which one or more egress interfaces are offered
      more packets than are forwarded.

   Discussion:
      This condition is a superset of the overload definition [<a href="#ref-Ma98" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>Ma98</a>].
      Overload [<a href="#ref-Ma98" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>Ma98</a>] deals with overloading input and output interfaces
      beyond the maximum transmission allowed by the medium.  Forwarding
      congestion does not assume ingress interface overload as the only
      source of overload on output interfaces.

      Another difference between Forwarding Congestion and overload
      occurs when the SUT comprises multiple elements, in that
      Forwarding Congestion may occur at multiple points.  Consider an
      SUT comprising multiple edge devices exchanging traffic with a
      single core device.  Depending on traffic patterns, the edge
      devices may induce Forwarding Congestion on multiple egress
      interfaces on the core device.

      Throughput [<a href="#ref-Br91" title='"Benchmarking terminology for network interconnection devices"'>Br91</a>] defines the lower boundary of Forwarding
      Congestion.  Throughput is the maximum offered rate with no
      Forwarding Congestion.  At offered rates above throughput, the
      DUT/SUT is considered to be in a state of Forwarding Congestion.

      Packet Loss, not increased Forwarding Delay, is the external
      observable metric used to indicate the condition of Forwarding
      Congestion.  Packet Loss is a deterministic indicator of
      Forwarding Congestion.  The condition of increased Forwarding
      Delay without Packet Loss is an indicator of Forwarding Congestion
      known as Incipient Congestion.  Incipient Congestion is a non-
      deterministic indicator of Forwarding Congestion [<a href="#ref-Fl93" title='"Random Early Detection gateways for Congestion Avoidance"'>Fl93</a>].  As
      stated in [<a href="#ref-Ec98">Ec98</a>], RED [<a href="#ref-Br98" title='"Recommendations on Queue Management and Congestion Avoidance in the Internet"'>Br98</a>] detects incipient congestion before
      the buffer overflows, but the current Internet environment is
      limited to packet loss as the mechanism for indicating congestion
      to the end-nodes.  [<a href="#ref-Ra99" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>Ra99</a>] implies that it is impractical to build
      a black-box test to observe Incipient Congestion.  [<a href="#ref-Ra99" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>Ra99</a>] instead
      introduces Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) as a
      deterministic Black-Box method for observing Incipient Congestion.
      [<a href="#ref-Ra99" title='"The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP"'>Ra99</a>] is an Experimental RFC with limited deployment, so ECN is
      not used for this particular methodology.  For the purpose of

      "black-box" testing a DUT/SUT, this methodology uses Packet Loss
      as the indicator of Forwarding Congestion.

      Ingress observations alone are not sufficient to cover all cases
      in which Forwarding Congestion may occur.  A device with an
      infinite amount of memory could buffer an infinite number of
      packets and eventually forward all of them.  However, these
      packets may or may not be forwarded during the test duration.
      Congestion Collapse [<a href="#ref-Na84" title='"Congestion control in IP/TCP internetworks"'>Na84</a>] is defined as the state in which
      buffers are full and all arriving packets MUST be dropped across
      the network.  Even though ingress interfaces accept all packets
      without loss, Forwarding Congestion is present in this
      hypothetical device.

      The definition presented here explicitly defines Forwarding
      Congestion as an event observable on egress interfaces.
      Regardless of internal architecture, any device exhibiting Packet
      Loss on one or more egress interfaces is experiencing Forwarding
      Congestion.

   Definition:
      An implementation of one or more per-hop behaviors to avoid or
      minimize the condition of congestion.

   Discussion:
      Congestion management may seek either to control congestion or
      avoid it altogether through Classification.

      Congestion avoidance mechanisms seek to prevent congestion before
      it actually occurs.

      Congestion control mechanisms give one or more flows (with a
      discrete IP Precedence or DSCP value) preferential treatment over
      other classes during periods of congestion.

   Definition:
      A flow is one or more packets sharing a common intended pair of
      ingress and egress interfaces.

   Discussion:
      Packets are grouped by the ingress and egress interfaces they use
      on a given DUT/SUT.

      A flow can contain multiple source IP addresses and/or destination
      IP addresses.  All packets in a flow MUST enter on the same
      ingress interface and exit on the same egress interface and have
      some common network layer content.

      Microflows [<a href="#ref-Ni98" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>Ni98</a>] are a subset of flows.  As defined in [<a href="#ref-Ni98" title='"Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers"'>Ni98</a>],
      microflows require application-to-application measurement.  In
      contrast, flows use lower-layer classification criteria.  Since
      this document focuses on network-layer classification criteria, it
      concentrates here on the use of network-layer identifiers in
      describing a flow.  Flow identifiers also may reside at the data-
      link, transport, or application layers of the OSI model.  However,
      identifiers other than those at the network layer are out of scope
      for this document.

      A flow may contain a single code point/IP precedence value or may
      contain multiple values destined for a single egress interface.
      This is determined by the test methodology.

   Definition:

      transmit successfully to the correct egress interface in response
      to a specified offered load while the device drops none of the
      offered packets.

   Discussion:
      Forwarding Capacity measures the packet rate at the egress
      interface(s) of the DUT/SUT.  In contrast, throughput (as defined
      in <a href="rfc1242.html">RFC 1242</a>) measures the packet rate at the ingress interface(s)
      of the DUT/SUT.

      Ingress-based measurements do not account for queuing of the
      DUT/SUT.  Throughput rates can be higher than the Forwarding
      Capacity because of queueing.  The difference is dependent upon
      test duration, packet rate, and queue size.  Forwarding Capacity,
      as an egress measurement, does take queuing into account.

      Understanding Forwarding Capacity is a necessary precursor to any
      measurement involving Traffic Control Mechanisms.  The
      accompanying methodology document MUST take into consideration
      Forwarding Capacity when determining the expected forwarding
      vectors.  When the sum of the expected forwarding vectors on an
      interface exceeds the Forwarding Capacity, the Forwarding Capacity
      will govern the forwarding rate.

      This measurement differs from forwarding rate at maximum offered
      load (FRMOL) [<a href="#ref-Ma98" title='"Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices"'>Ma98</a>] in that the Forwarding Capacity requires zero
      loss.

   Definition:
      The time interval starting when the last bit of the input IP
      packet is offered to the input port of the DUT/SUT and ending when
      the last bit of the output IP packet is received from the output
      port of the DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:
      The delay time interval MUST be externally observed.  The delay
      measurement MUST NOT include delays added by test bed components
      other than the DUT/SUT, such as propagation time introduced by
      cabling or non-zero delay added by the test instrument.
      Forwarding Delay differs from latency [<a href="#ref-Br91" title='"Benchmarking terminology for network interconnection devices"'>Br91</a>] and one-way delay
      [<a href="#ref-Al99" title='"A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM"'>Al99</a>] in several key regards:

      1. Latency [<a href="#ref-Br91" title='"Benchmarking terminology for network interconnection devices"'>Br91</a>] assumes knowledge of whether the DUT/SUT uses
         "store and forward" or "bit forwarding" technology.  Forwarding
         Delay is the same metric, measured the same way, regardless of
         the architecture of the DUT/SUT.

<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-10" id="page-10" name="page-10"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4689.html">RFC 4689</a>       Terminology for Traffic Control Mechanisms   October 2006</span>


      2. Forwarding Delay is a last-in, last-out (LILO) measurement,
         unlike the last-in, first-out method [<a href="#ref-Br91" title='"Benchmarking terminology for network interconnection devices"'>Br91</a>] or the first-in,
         last-out method [<a href="#ref-Al99" title='"A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM"'>Al99</a>].

         The LILO method most closely simulates the way a network-layer
         device actually processes an IP datagram.  IP datagrams are not
         passed up and down the stack unless they are complete, and
         processing begins only once the last bit of the IP datagram has
         been received.

         Further, the LILO method has an additive property, where the
         sum of the parts MUST equal the whole.  This is a key
         difference from [<a href="#ref-Br91" title='"Benchmarking terminology for network interconnection devices"'>Br91</a>] and [<a href="#ref-Al99" title='"A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM"'>Al99</a>].  For example, the delay
         added by two DUTs MUST equal the sum of the delay of the DUTs.
         This may or may not be the case with [<a href="#ref-Br91" title='"Benchmarking terminology for network interconnection devices"'>Br91</a>] and [<a href="#ref-Al99" title='"A One-way Delay Metric for IPPM"'>Al99</a>].

      3. Forwarding Delay measures the IP datagram only, unlike [<a href="#ref-Br91" title='"Benchmarking terminology for network interconnection devices"'>Br91</a>],
         which also includes link-layer overhead.

         A metric focused exclusively on the Internet protocol relieves
         the tester from specifying the start/end for every link-layer
         protocol that IP runs on.  This avoids the need to determine
         whether the start/stop delimiters are included.  It also allows
         the use of heterogeneous link-layer protocols in a test.

      4. Forwarding Delay can be measured at any offered load, whereas
         the latency methodology [<a href="#ref-Br99" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices"'>Br99</a>] recommends measurement at, and
         only at, the throughput level.  Comparing the Forwarding Delay
         below the throughput to Forwarding Delay above the Forwarding
         Capacity will give insight to the traffic control mechanisms.

         For example, non-congested delay may be measured with an
         offered load that does not exceed the Forwarding Capacity,
         while congested delay may involve an offered load that exceeds
         the Forwarding Capacity.

         Note: Forwarding Delay SHOULD NOT be used as an absolute
         indicator of DUT/SUT Forwarding Congestion.  While Forwarding
         Delay may rise when offered load nears or exceeds the
         Forwarding Capacity, there is no universal point at which
         Forwarding Delay can be said to indicate the presence or
         absence of Forwarding Congestion.

   Definition:
      The absolute value of the difference between the Forwarding Delay
      of two consecutive received packets belonging to the same stream.

   Discussion:
      The Forwarding Delay fluctuation between two consecutive received
      packets in a stream is reported as the jitter.  Jitter can be
      expressed as |D(i) - D(i-1)|, where D equals the Forwarding Delay
      and i is the order the packets were received.

      Under loss, jitter can be measured between non-consecutive test
      sequence numbers.  When IP Traffic Control Mechanisms are dropping
      packets, fluctuating Forwarding Delay may be observed.  Jitter
      MUST be able to benchmark the delay variation independently of
      packet loss.

      Jitter is related to the IPDV [<a href="#ref-De02" title='"IP Packet Delay Variation Metric for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)"'>De02</a>] (IP Delay Variation) by
      taking the absolute value of the ipdv.  The two metrics will
      produce different mean values.  Mean Jitter will produce a
      positive value, where the mean ipdv is typically zero.  Also, IPDV
      is undefined when one packet from a pair is lost.

      the best-effort class, is offered to the device.  Measurements
      with "undifferentiated response" SHOULD be made to establish a
      baseline.

      The vector(s) obtained with DSCP or IP precedence enabled can be
      compared to the undifferentiated response to determine the effect
      of differentiating traffic.

   Definition:
      A field in the IP payload portion of the packet that is used to
      verify the order of the packets on the egress of the DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:
      The traffic generator sets the test sequence number value.  Upon
      receipt of the packet,  the traffic receiver checks the value.
      The traffic generator changes the value on each packet transmitted
      based on an algorithm agreed to by the traffic receiver.

      The traffic receiver keeps track of the sequence numbers on a
      per-stream basis.  In addition to the number of received packets,
      the traffic receiver may also report the number of in-sequence
      packets, the number of out-of-sequence packets, the number of
      duplicate packets, and the number of reordered packets.  The
      RECOMMENDED algorithm to change the sequence number on sequential
      packets is an incrementing value.

   Definition:

      receiver.  A stream MUST share common content, such as type (IP,
      UDP), IP SA/DA, packet size, or payload.

   Discussion:
      Streams are tracked by test sequence number or "unique signature
      field" [<a href="#ref-Ma00" title='"Benchmarking Methodology for LAN Switching Devices"'>Ma00</a>].  Streams define how individual packet statistics
      are grouped together to form an intelligible summary.

      Common stream groupings would be by egress interface, destination
      address, source address, DSCP, or IP precedence.  A stream using
      test sequence numbers can track the ordering of packets as they
      traverse the DUT/SUT.

      Streams are not restricted to a pair of source and destination
      interfaces as long as all packets are tracked as a single entity.
      A multicast stream can be forwarded to multiple destination
      interfaces.

   Definition:
      A received packet with the expected Test Sequence number.

   Discussion:
      In-sequence is done on a stream level.  As packets are received on
      a stream, each packet's Test Sequence number is compared with the
      previous packet.  Only packets that match the expected Test
      Sequence number are considered in-sequence.

      Packets that do not match the expected Test Sequence number are
      counted as "not in-sequence" or out-of-sequence.  Every packet
      that is received is either in-sequence or out-of-sequence.
      Subtracting the in-sequence from the received packets (for that
      stream), the tester can derive the out-of-sequence count.

      Two types of events will prevent the in-sequence from
      incrementing: packet loss and reordered packets.

   Measurement units:
      Packet count

   Definition:
      A received packet with a sequence number less than the sequence
      number of any previously arriving packet.

   Discussion:
      As a stream of packets enters a DUT/SUT, they include a Stream
      Test Sequence number indicating the order the packets were sent to
      the DUT/SUT.  On exiting the DUT/SUT, these packets may arrive in
      a different order.  Each packet that was reordered is counted as
      an Out-of-Order Packet.

      Certain streaming protocols (such as TCP) require the packets to
      be in a certain order.  Packets outside this are dropped by the
      streaming protocols even though they were properly received by the
      IP layer.  The type of reordering tolerated by a streaming
      protocol varies from protocol to protocol, and also by
      implementation.

      Packet loss does not affect the Out-of-Order Packet count.  The
      Out-of-Order Packet count is impacted only by packets that were
      not received in the order that they were transmitted.

   Definition:
      A received packet with a Test Sequence number matching a
      previously received packet.

   Discussion:
      A Duplicate Packet is a packet that the DUT/SUT has successfully
      transmitted out an egress interface more than once.  The egress
      interface has previously forwarded this packet.

      A Duplicate Packet SHOULD be a bit-for-bit copy of an already
      transmitted packet (including Test Sequence number).  If the
      Duplicate Packet traversed different paths through the DUT/SUT,
      some fields (such as TTL or checksum) may have changed.

      A multicast packet is not a Duplicate Packet by definition.  For a
      given IP multicast group, a DUT/SUT SHOULD forward a packet once
      on a given egress interface provided the path to one or more
      multicast receivers is through that interface.  Several egress
      interfaces will transmit the same packet, but only once per
      interface.

      To detect a Duplicate Packet, each packet offered to the DUT/SUT
      MUST contain a unique packet-by-packet identifier.

   Discussion:
      Instantaneous Jitter is the absolute value of the difference
      between the Forwarding Delay measurement of two packets belonging
      to the same stream.

      The Forwarding Delay fluctuation between two consecutive packets
      in a stream is reported as the "Instantaneous Jitter".
      Instantaneous Jitter can be expressed as |D(i) - D(i-1)|, where D
      equals the Forwarding Delay and i is the test sequence number.
      Packets lost are not counted in the measurement.

      The Forwarding Vector may contain several Jitter Vectors.  For n
      packets received in a Forwarding Vector, there is a total of (n-1)
      Instantaneous Jitter Vectors.

   Definition:
      A description of the expected maximum variation in the Forwarding
      Delay of packet arrival times for packets arriving in a stream
      matching a specific classification, such as DSCP.

   Discussion:
      Peak-to-peak Jitter Vector is the maximum Forwarding Delay minus
      the minimum Forwarding Delay of the packets (in a vector)
      forwarded by the DUT/SUT.

      Peak-to-peak Jitter is not derived from the Instantaneous Jitter
      Vector.  Peak-to-peak Jitter is based upon all the packets during
      the test duration, not just two consecutive packets.

      The value of the Expected Peak-to-peak Jitter Vector is dependent
      on the set of offered vectors and Classification configuration on
      the DUT/SUT.  The DUT is configured in a certain way so that
      classification occurs when a traffic mix consisting of multiple
      streams is applied.

      This term captures the expected forwarding behavior from the DUT
      receiving multiple Offered Vectors.  The actual algorithm or
      mechanism the DUT uses to achieve service differentiation is
      implementation specific and is not important when describing the
      Expected Peak-to-peak Jitter Vector.

   Discussion:
      Instantaneous Delay Vector is expressed as a combination of
      values: the classification rules AND Forwarding Delay.  For every

      Instantaneous Delay Vector can be obtained at any offered load.
      It is RECOMMENDED that this vector be obtained at or below the

   Discussion:
      Average Delay Vector is expressed as combination of values: the
      classification rules AND average Forwarding Delay.

      The average Forwarding Delay is computed by averaging all the
      Instantaneous Delay Vectors for a given stream.

   Definition:
      The jitter for two consecutive packets in a stream matching a
      specific classification, such as DSCP, that a DUT/SUT is measured
      to transmit to the correct destination interface successfully in
      response to an offered vector.

   Discussion:
      Instantaneous Jitter is the absolute value of the difference
      between the Forwarding Delay measurement of two packets belonging
      to the same stream.

      The Instantaneous Jitter vector is expressed as a pair of numbers.
      Both the specific DSCP (or IP precedence) value AND jitter value
      combine to make a vector.

      The Forwarding Delay fluctuation between two consecutive packets
      in a stream is reported as the "Instantaneous Jitter".
      Instantaneous Jitter Vector can be expressed as |D(i) - D(i-1)|,
      where D equals the Forwarding Delay and i is the test sequence
      number.  Packets lost are not counted in the measurement.

      The Instantaneous Jitter Vector is a per-hop measurement.  The
      DUT/SUT MAY remark the specific DSCP or IP precedence value for a
      multi-hop measurement.  The stream remains the same.

      There may be several Instantaneous Jitter Vectors for a single
      stream.  For n packets measured, there may be (n-1) Instantaneous
      Jitter Vectors.
