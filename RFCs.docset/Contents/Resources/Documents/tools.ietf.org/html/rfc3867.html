Abstract

   The Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) provides a data exchange
   format for trading purposes while integrating existing pure payment
   protocols seamlessly.  This motivates the multiple layered system
   architecture which consists of at least some generic IOTP application
   core and multiple specific payment modules.

   This document addresses a common interface between the IOTP
   application core and the payment modules, enabling the
   interoperability between these kinds of modules.  Furthermore, such
   an interface provides the foundations for a plug-in-mechanism in
   actual implementations of IOTP application cores.

   Such interfaces exist at the Consumers', the Merchants' and the
   Payment Handlers' installations connecting the IOTP application core
   and the payment software components/legacy systems.

   Common network technologies are based on standardized and established
   Internet technologies.  The Internet technologies provide mechanisms
   and tools for presentation, application development, network
   infrastructure, security, and basic data exchange.

   Due to the presence of already installed trading roles' systems with
   their own interfaces (Internet shop, order management, payment,
   billing, and delivery management systems, or financial institute's
   legacy systems), IOTP has been limited to the common external
   interface over the Internet. However, some of these internal
   interfaces might be also standardized for better integration of IOTP
   aware components with of the existing infrastructure and its cost
   effective reuse. For more information on IOTP, see [<a href="#ref-IOTP" title='"Internet Open Trading Protocol - IOTP version 1.0"'>IOTP</a>] and
   [<a href="#ref-IOTPBOOK" title="and M. Goncalves">IOTPBOOK</a>].

   The typical Payment Handlers (i.e., financial institutes or near-bank
   organizations) as well as Merchants require an IOTP aware application
   that easily fits into their existing financial infrastructure.  The
   Payment Handler might even insist on the reuse of special in-house
   solutions for some subtasks of the IOTP aware application, e.g.,
   reflecting their cryptography modules, gateway interfaces, or
   physical environment.  Therefore, their IOTP aware implementation
   really requires such clear internal interfaces.

   More important, consumers demand modularization and clear internal
   interfaces: Their IOTP application aims at the support of multiple
   payment methods.  Consumers prefer the flexible use of different
   seamless integrating payment methods within one trading application
   with nearly identical behavior and user interface.  The existence of
   a well-defined interface enables payment software developers to bolt
   on their components to other developer's general IOTP Application
   Core.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3867.html">RFC 3867</a>                  Payment API for IOTP             November 2004</span>


   Initially, this consideration leads to the two-level layered view of
   the IOTP software for each role, consisting of:

   o  some generic IOTP system component, the so-called IOTP application
      core - providing IOTP based gateway services and generic business
      logic and

   o  the trading roles' specific back-end systems implementing the
      specific trading transaction types' functionality.

   In order to isolate the changes on the infrastructure, the IOTP
   trading application has been three-layered:

   o  the IOTP Application Core processes the generic parts of the IOTP
      transaction and holds the connection to the Internet,

   o  the Existing Legacy System or Existing Payment Software which
      processes the actual transaction type, and particular payment
      transaction, and

   o  the IOTP Middle-ware or IOTP Payment Bridge which glues the other
      two possibly incompatible components.  It brokers between the
      specific interface of the Existing Legacy System and the
      standardized interfaces of the IOTP Application Core.

   As IOTP extends payment schemes to a trading scheme, primarily, this
   document focuses on payment modules, i.e., the interface between the
   IOTP Payment Bridge and the IOTP Application Core.  It provides a
   standard method for exchanging payment protocol messages between the
   parties involved in a payment.  But, it does not specify any
   interface for order or delivery processing.

   Such a Payment Application Programmers Interface (API) must suit for
   a broad range of payment methods: (1) software based like Credit Card
   SET or CyberCoin, (2) chip card based like Mondex or GeldKarte, and
   (3) mimicries of typical and traditional payment methods like money
   transfer, direct debit, deposit, withdrawal, money exchange and value
   points.  It should support both payments with explicit consumer
   acknowledge and automatic repeated payments, which have been consumer
   approved in advance.  For more information on SET, see [<a href="#ref-SET" title="Version 1.0">SET</a>].

   The following discussion focuses on the Consumer's point of view and
   uses the associated terminology.  When switching to Merchants' or
   Delivery Handlers' IOTP aware applications, the payment related
   components should be implicitly renamed by Existing Legacy Systems to
   the IOTP Middle-ware.

   The next two sub-sections describe the general payment scenario and
   several assumptions about the coarsely sketched software components.

   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> illustrates the payment transaction progress and message
   flow of different kinds of transaction behavior.  Sections <a href="#section-3">3</a> to <a href="#section-4">4</a>

   call back interface.

   The following table sketches the four logical steps of many payment
   schemes.  The preceding agreements about the goods, payment method,
   purchase amount, or delivery rules are omitted.

   and                              some nonce
   Initialization Consumer          Responses to the requests and
                                    generation of own nonce

   Authorization  Payment Handler   Generation of the authorization
                                    request (for consumer)
                  Consumer          Agreement to payment (by
                                    reservation of the Consumer's
                                    e-money)
                  Payment Handler   Acceptance or rejection of the
                                    agreement (consumer's
                                    authorization response),
                                    generation of the authorization
                                    request (for issuer/acquirer),
                                    and processing of its response

   Capture                          Generation of the capture
                                    request (for issuer/acquirer)

   Reversal                         On rejection (online/delayed):
                                    generation of the reversal data
                  Consumer          Receipt of the refund

   However, some payment schemes:

   o  limit themselves to one-sided authentication,
   o  perform off-line authorization without any referral to any
      issuer/acquirer,
   o  apply capture processing in batch mode, or
   o  do not distinguish between authorization and capture,
   o  lack an inbound mechanism for reversals or implement a limited
      variant.

   This model applies not only to payments at the typical points of
   sales but extends to refunds, deposits, withdrawals, electronic
   cheques, direct debits, and money transfers.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.%20%20Assumptions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Assumptions</span>

   In outline, the IOTP Payment Bridge processes some input sequence of
   payment protocol messages being forwarded by the IOTP Application
   Core.  It (1) disassembles the messages, (2) maps them onto the
   formats of the Existing Payment Software, (3) assembles its
   responses, and (4) returns another sequence of payment protocol
   messages that is mostly intended for transparent transmission by the
   IOTP Application Core to some IOTP aware remote party.  Normally,
   this process continues between the two parties until the Payment
   Handler's Payment API signals the payment termination.
   Exceptionally, each system component may signal failures.

   The relationship between the aforementioned components is illustrated
   in the following figure.  These components might be related to each
   other in a flexible n-to-m-manner:

   o  One IOTP Application Core may manage multiple IOTP Payment Bridges
      and the latter might be shared between multiple IOTP Application
      Cores.
   o  Each Payment Bridge may manage multiple Existing Payment Software
      modules and the latter might be shared between multiple Payment
      Bridges.
   o  Each Existing Payment Software may manage multiple payment schemes
      (e.g., SET) and the latter might be supported by multiple Existing
      Payment Software modules.  For more information on SET see [<a href="#ref-SET" title="Version 1.0">SET</a>].

   o  Each payment scheme may support multiple payment instruments
      (e.g., particular card) or methods (e.g., Visa via SET) and the
      latter might be shared by multiple Existing Payment Software
      Components.

                 Figure 1: Relationship of the Components

   The Payment API considers the following transaction types of Baseline
   IOTP:

      o  Baseline Purchase,
      o  Baseline Refund,
      o  Baseline Value Exchange,
      o  Baseline Withdrawal, and
      o  Baseline (Payment) Inquiry.

   For more information on Baseline IOTP, see [<a href="#ref-IOTP" title='"Internet Open Trading Protocol - IOTP version 1.0"'>IOTP</a>] and [<a href="#ref-IOTPBOOK" title="and M. Goncalves">IOTPBOOK</a>].

   First, the authors' vision of the IOTP aware application's and its
   main components' capabilities are clarified: On the one hand, the
   Payment API should be quite powerful and flexible for sufficient
   connection of the generic and specific components.  On the other
   hand, the Payment API should not be overloaded with nice-to-haves
   being unsupported by Existing Payment Software.

   Despite the strong similarities on the processing of successful
   payments, failure resolution and inquiry capabilities differ
   extremely among different payment schemes.  These aspects may even
   vary between different payment instrument using the same payment
   schemes.  Additionally, the specific requirements of Consumers,
   Merchants and Payment Handlers add variance and complexity.
   Therefore, it is envisioned that the IOTP Application Core provides
   only very basic inquiry mechanisms while complex and payment scheme
   specific inquiries, failure analysis, and failure resolution are
   fully deferred to the actual Existing Payment Software - including
   the user interface.




<span class="grey">Hans, et al.                 Informational                      [Page 7]</span></pre>

   The IOTP Application Core processes payments transparently, i.e., it
   forwards the wrapped payment scheme specific messages to the
   associated IOTP Payment Bridge/Existing Payment Software.  The
   Existing Payment Software might even use these messages for inbound
   failure resolution.  It reports only the final payment status to the
   IOTP Application Core or some intermediate - might be also final -
   status on abnormal interruption.

   The IOTP Application Core implements the generic and payment scheme
   independent part of the IOTP transaction processing and provides the
   suitable user interface.  Focusing on payment related tasks, it

   o  manages the registered IOTP Payment Bridges and provides a
      mechanism for their registration - the latter is omitted by this
      document.

   o  assumes that any IOTP Payment Bridge is a passive component, i.e.,
      it strictly awaits input data and generates one response to each
      request,

   o  supports the payment negotiation (Consumer: selection of the
      actual payment instrument or method; Merchant: selection of the
      payment methods being offered to the Consumer) preceding the
      payment request,

   o  requests additional payment specific support from the Existing
      Payment Software via the selected and registered the IOTP Payment
      Bridge,

   o  initializes and terminates the Existing Payment Software via the
      IOTP Payment Bridge,

   o  inquires authentication data (for subsequent request or response)
      from the Existing Payment Software, specific authentication
      component - omitted in this document - or Consumer (by a suitable
      user interface),

   o  supervises the online transaction process and traces its progress,

   o  stores the transaction data being exchanged over the IOTP wire -
      payment scheme specific data is handled transparently,

   o  relates each payment transaction with multiple payment parameters
      (IOTP Transaction Identifier, Trading Protocol Options, Payment
      Instrument/Method, Offer Response, IOTP Payment Bridge, and Wallet
      Identifier, associated remote Parties).  The relation might be





<span class="grey">Hans, et al.                 Informational                      [Page 8]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-9" id="page-9" name="page-9"> </a>

      lowered to the party's Payment Identifier, IOTP Payment Bridge,
      Wallet Identifier, and the remote parties when the actual payment
      transaction has been successfully started.

   o  implements a payment transaction progress indicator,

   o  enables the inquiry of pending and completed payment transactions,

   o  implements generic dialogs, e.g., brand selection, payment
      acknowledge, payment suspension / cancellation, receipt
      visualization, basic transaction inquiry, balance inquiry, or
      receipt validation,

   o  defers payment specific processing, supervision, validation, and
      error resolution to the Existing Payment Software.  It is
      expected, that the Existing Payment Software will try to resolve
      many errors first by the extended exchange of Payment Exchange
      messages.  The most significant and visible failures arise from
      sudden unavailability or lapses of the local or opposing payment
      component.

   o  supports the invocation of any Existing Payment Software in an
      interactive mode, which might be used (1) for the payment scheme
      specific post-processing of a (set of) payment transactions, (2)
      for the analysis of a payment instrument, (3) for the registration
      of a new payment instrument/scheme, or (4) re-configuration of a
      payment instrument/scheme.

   o  exports call back functions for use by the IOTP Payment Bridge or
      Existing Payment Software for progress indication.

   In addition, the IOTP Application Core

   o  manages the IOTP message components and IOTP message blocks
      exchanged during the transaction which may be referenced and
      accessed during the processing of subsequent messages, e.g., for
      signature verification.  In particular, it stores named Packaged
      Content elements exchanged during payments.

   o  manages several kinds of identifiers, i.e., transaction, message,
      component, and block identifiers,

   o  implements a message caching mechanism,

   o  detects time-outs at the protocol and API level reflecting the
      communication with both the IOTP aware remote party and the
      Payment API aware local periphery, e.g., chip card (reader) may
      raise time-outs.

   However, the IOTP Payment Bridge and Existing Payment Software do not
   have to rely on all of these IOTP Application Core's capabilities.
   E.g., some Consumer's Existing Payment Software may refuse the
   disclosure of specific payment instruments at brand selection time
   and may delay this selection to the "Check Payment Possibility"
   invocation using its own user interface.

   The IOTP Payment Bridge's capabilities do not only deal with actual
   payments between the Consumer and the Payment Handler but extend to
   the following:

   o  translation and (dis)assemblage of messages between the formats of
      the IOTP Payment API and those of the Existing Payment Software.
      Payment API requests and response are strictly 1-to-1 related.

   o  Consumer's payment instrument selection by the means of an
      unsecured/public export of the relationship of payment brands,
      payment protocols, and payment instruments (identifiers).
      Generally, this includes not just the brand (Mondex, GeldKarte,
      etc.) but also which specific instance of the instrument and
      currency to use (e.g., which specific Mondex card and which
      currency of all those available).

   However, some Existing Payment Software may defer the selection of
   the payment instrument to the actual payment carrying-out or it may
   even lack any management of payment instruments.  E.g., chip card
   based payment methods may offer - Point of Sale like - implicit
   selection of the payment instrument by simple insertion of the chip
   card into the chip card reader or it interrogates the inserted card
   and requests an acknowledge (or selection) of the detected payment
   instrument(s).

   o  payment progress checks, e.g., is there enough funds available to
      carry out the purchase, or enough funds left for the refund,

   o  IOTP Payment Receipt checks which might be performed over its
      Packaged Content or by other means.

   o  recoding of payment scheme specific receipts into a format which
      can be displayed to the user or printed,

   o  cancellation of payment, even though it is not complete,

   o  suspension and resumption of payment transactions.  Two kinds of
      failures the Existing Payment Software might deal with are (1) the
      time-out of the network connection and (2) lack of funds.  For
      resolution, the IOTP Application Core may try the suspension with
      a view to later possible resumption.

   o  recording the payment progress and status on a database.  E.g.,
      information about pending payments might be used to assist their
      continuation when the next payment protocol message is received.

   o  payment transaction status inquiry, so that the inquirer - IOTP
      Application Core or User - can determine the appropriate next
      step.

   o  balance inquiry or transaction history, e.g., consumers may
      interrogate their chip card based payment instrument or remotely
      administer some account in advance of a payment transaction
      acknowledge,

   o  inquiry on abnormal interrupted payment transactions, which might
      be used by the IOTP Application Core to resolve these pending
      transactions at startup (after power failure).

   o  payment progress indication.  This could be used to inform the end
      user of details on what is happening with the payment.

   o  payment method specific authentication methods.

   Existing Payment Software may not provide full support of these
   capabilities.  E.g., some payment schemes may not support or may even
   prevent the explicit transaction cancellation at arbitrary phases of
   the payment process.  In this case, the IOTP Payment Bridge has to
   implement at least skeletons that signal such lack of support by the
   use of specific error codes (see below).

   The Existing Payment Software's capabilities vary extremely.  It

   o  supports payment scheme specific processing, supervision,
      validation, and error resolution.  It is expected, that many
      errors are tried to be resolved first by the extended exchange of
      Payment Exchange messages.

   o  provides hints for out-of-band failure resolution on failed
      inbound resolution - inbound resolution is invisible to the IOTP
      Application Core.

   o  may implement arbitrary transaction data management and inquiry
      mechanisms ranging from no transaction recording, last transaction
      recording, chip card deferred transaction recording, simple
      transaction history to sophisticated persistent data management
      with flexible user inquiry capabilities.  The latter is required
      by Payment Handlers for easy and cost effective failure
      resolution.

   o  implements the payment scheme specific dialog boxes.

   Even the generic dialog boxes of the IOTP Application Core might be
   unsuitable: Particular (business or scheme) rules may require some
   dedicated appearance / structure / content or the dialog boxes, may
   prohibit the unsecured export of payment instruments, or may
   prescribe the pass phrase input under its own control.

   The following lists all functions of the IOTP Payment API:

      o  Brand Compilation Related API Functions

   "Find Accepted Payment Brand" identifies the accepted payment brands
   for any indicated currency amount.

   "Find Accepted Payment Protocol" identifies the accepted payment
   protocols for any indicated currency amount (and brand) and returns
   payment scheme specific packaged content for brand selection
   purposes.

   This function might be used in conjunction with the aforementioned
   function or called without any brand identifier.

   "Get Payment Initialization Data" returns additional payment scheme
   specific packaged content for payment processing by the payment
   handler.

   "Inquire Authentication Challenge" returns the payment scheme
   specific authentication challenge value.

   "Check Authentication Response" verifies the returned payment scheme
   specific authentication response value.

   "Change Process State" is used (here only) for abnormal termination.
   (cf. Payment Processing Related API Functions).

      o  Brand Selection Related API Functions

   "Find Payment Instrument" identifies which instances of a payment
   instrument of a particular payment brand are available for use in a
   payment.

   "Check Payment Possibility" checks whether a specific payment
   instrument is able to perform a payment.





<span class="grey">Hans, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 12]</span></pre>

   "Authenticate" forwards any payment scheme specific authentication
   data to the IOTP Payment Bridge for processing.

   "Change Process State" is used (here only) for abnormal termination.
   (cf. Payment Processing Related API Functions).

      o  Payment Processing Related API Functions

   "Start or Resume Payment Consumer/Payment Handler" initiate or resume
   a payment transaction.  There exist specific API functions for the
   two trading roles Consumer and Payment Handler.

   "Continue Process" forwards payment scheme specific data to the
   Existing Payment Software and returns more payment scheme specific
   data for transmission to the counter party.

   "Change Process State" changes the current status of payment
   transactions.  Typically, this call is used for termination or
   suspension without success.

      o  General Inquiry API Functions

   "Remove Payment Log" notifies the IOTP Payment Bridge that a
   particular entry has been removed from the Payment Log of the IOTP
   Application Core.

   "Payment Instrument Inquiry" retrieves the properties of Payment
   Instruments.

   "Inquire Pending Payment" reports any abnormal interrupted payment
   transaction known by the IOTP Payment Bridge.

   Payment Processing Related Inquiry API Functions

   "Check Payment Receipt" checks the consistency and validity of IOTP
   Payment Receipts, received from the Payment Handler or returned by
   "Inquire Process State" API calls.  Typically, this function is
   called by the Consumer during the final processing of payment
   transactions.  Nevertheless, this check might be advantageous both
   for Consumers and Payment Handlers on failure resolution.

   "Expand Payment Receipt" expands the Packaged Content of IOTP Payment
   Receipts as well as payment scheme specific payment receipts into a
   form which can be used for display or printing purposes.

   "Inquire Process State" responds with the payment state and the IOTP
   Payment Receipt Component.  Normally, this function is called by the
   Payment Handler for final processing of the payment transaction.

   "Start Payment Inquiry" prepares the remote inquiry of the payment
   transaction status and responds with payment scheme specific data
   that might be needed by the Payment Handler for the Consumer
   initiated inquiry processing.

   "Inquire Payment Status" is called by the Payment Handler on Consumer
   initiated inquiry requests.  This function returns the payment scheme
   specific content of the Inquiry Response Block.

   "Continue Process" and "Change Process State" (cf. Payment Processing
   Related API Calls)

      o  Other API Functions

   "Manage Payment Software" enables the immediate activation of the
   Existing Payment Software.  Further user input is under control of
   the Existing Payment Software.

   "Call Back" provides a general interface for the visualization of
   transaction progress by the IOTP Application Core.

   The next sections sketch the relationships and the dependencies
   between the API functions.  They provide the informal description of
   the progress alternatives and depict the communication and
   synchronization between the general IOTP Application Core and the
   payment scheme specific modules.

   1. (Authenticator Process) None, one or multiple IOTP Payment Bridges
      (IPB) are requested for one or multiple authentication challenge
      values ("Inquire Authentication Challenge").  Each value is
      encapsulated in an IOTP Authentication Request Component.  In
      addition, the IOTP Application Core may add payment scheme
      independent authentication methods.  All of them form the final
      IOTP Authentication Request Block, which describes the set of
      authentication methods being supported by the authenticator and
      from which the Authenticatee has to choose one method.

      Note that the interface of the API function is limited to the
      response of exactly one algorithm per call.  If the IOTP
      Application Core provides a choice of algorithms for input, this
      choice should be reduced successively by the returned algorithm
      ({Alg(i+1)*} is subset of {Algi*}).

      During the registration of new Payment Instruments, the IOTP
      Payment Bridge notifies the IOTP Application Core about the
      supported authentication algorithms.

   2. On the presence of an IOTP Authentication Block within the
      received IOTP message, the Authenticatee's IOTP Application Core
      checks whether the IOTP transaction type in the current phase
      actually supports the authentication process.

      For each provided Authentication Request Component, the IOTP
      Application Core analyzes the algorithms' names, the transaction
      context, and optionally user preferences in order to determine the
      system components which are capable to process the authentication
      request items.  Such system components might be the IOTP
      Application Core itself or any of the registered IOTP Payment
      Bridges.

      Subsequently, the IOTP Application Core requests the responses to
      the supplied challenges from the determined system components in
      any order.  The authentication trials stop with the first
      successful response, which is included in the IOTP Authentication
      Response Block.

      Alternatively, the IOTP Application might ask for a user
      selection.  This might be appropriate, if two or more
      authentication algorithms are received that require explicit user
      interaction, like PIN or chip card insertion.

      The Authenticatee's organizational data is requested by an IOTP
      Authentication Request Block without any content element.  On
      failure, the authentication (sequence) might be retried, or the
      whole transaction might be suspended or cancelled.

   3. (Authenticator Process) The IOTP Application Core checks the
      presence of the IOTP Authentication Response Component in the
      Authentication Response Block and forwards its content to the
      generator of the associated authentication challenge for
      verification ("Check Authentication Response").

      On sole organizational data request, its presence is checked.

      Any verification must succeed in order to proceed with the
      transaction.

   The following shows how the API functions are used together so that
   the Merchant can (1) compile the Brand List Component, (2) generate
   the Payment Component, and (3) adjust the Order Component with
   payment scheme specific packaged content.

   1.  The Merchant's commerce server controls the shopping dialog with
       its own mechanisms until the Consumer checks out the shopping
       cart and indicates the payment intention.  The notion shopping
       subsumes any non-IOTP based visit of the Merchant Trading Role's
       (which subsumes Financial Institutes) web site in order to
       negotiate the content of the IOTP Order Component.  The
       subsequent processing switches to the IOTP based form by the
       activation of the Merchant's IOTP aware application.

   2.  The IOTP Application Core inquires for the IOTP level trading
       parameters (Consumer's shopping identifier, payment direction,
       initial currency amounts, discount rates, Merchant's and Delivery
       Handler's Net Locations, Non-Payment Handler's Organizational
       Data, initial order information, ....).

   3.  The registered IOTP Payment Bridges are inquired by the IOTP
       Application Core about the accepted payment brands ("Find
       Accepted Payment Brand").  Their responses provide most of the
       attribute values for the compilation of the Brand List
       Component's Brand Elements.  The IOTP Application Core might
       optionally match the returned payment brands with Merchant's
       general preferences.

       The IOTP Application Core must provide any wallet identifiers, if
       they are required by the IOTP Payment Bridges which signal their
       need by specific error codes (see below).  Any signaled error
       that could not be immediately solved by the IOTP Application Core
       should be logged - this applies also to the subsequent API calls
       of this section.  In this case, the IOTP Application Core creates
       an IOTP Error Block (hard error), transmits it to the Consumer,
       and terminates the current transaction.

   4.  The IOTP Application Core interrogates the IOTP Payment Bridges
       for each accepted payment brand about the supported payment
       protocols ("Find Accepted Payment Protocol").  These responses
       provide the remaining attribute values of the Brand Elements as
       well as all attribute values for the compilation of the Brand
       List Component's Protocol Amount and Pay Protocol Elements.

       Furthermore, the organisational data about the Payment Handler is
       returned.  The IOTP Application Core might optionally match the
       returned payment brands with Merchant's general preferences.

       Alternatively, the IOTP Application Core might skip the calls of
       "Find Accepted Payment Brands" (cf. Step 3) and issue the "Find
       Accepted Payment Protocol" call without any Brand given on the
       input parameter list.  In this case, the IOTP Payment Bridge
       responds to the latter call with the whole set of payment schemes
       supported w.r.t. the other input parameters.

   5.  The steps 3 and 4 are repeated during IOTP Value Exchange
       transactions - these steps are omitted in the previous figure.

   6.  The IOTP Application Core compiles the Brand List Component(s)
       and the IOTP Trading Protocol Options Block.  It is recommended
       that the "equal" items returned by IOTP Payment Bridge function
       calls are shared due to the extensive linking capabilities within

       the Brand List Component.  However, the compilation must consider
       several aspects in order to prevent conflicts - sharing detection
       might be textual matching (after normalization):

      o  Packaged Content Elements contained in the Brand List Component
         (and subsequently generated Payment and Order Components) might
         be payment scheme specific and might depend on each other.

      o  Currently, IOTP lacks precise rules for the content of the
         Packaged Content Element.  Therefore, transaction / brand /
         protocol / currency amount (in)dependent data might share the
         same Packaged Content Element or might spread across multiple
         Packaged Content Elements.

      o  The Consumer's IOTP Application Core transparently passes the
         Packaged Content Elements to the IOTP Payment Bridges which
         might not be able to handle payment scheme data of other
         payment schemes, accurately.

       The rules and mechanisms of how this could be accomplished are
       out of the scope of this document.  Furthermore, this document
       does not define any further restriction to the IOTP
       specification.

   7.  The IOTP Application Core determines whether the IOTP message can
       be enriched with an Offer Response Block.  This is valid under
       the following conditions:

      o  All payment alternatives share the attribute values and
         Packaged Content Elements of the subsequently generated IOTP
         Payment and Order Components.

      o  The subsequently generated data does not depend on any IOTP
         BrandSelInfo Elements that might be reported by the consumer
         within the TPO Selection Block in the brand dependent variant.

       If both conditions are fulfilled, the IOTP Application Core might
       request the remaining payment scheme specific payment
       initialization data from the IOTP Payment Bridge ("Get Payment
       Initialization Data") and compile the IOTP Offer Response Block.

       Optionally, the IOTP Application Core might request the current
       process state from the IOTP Payment Bridge and add the inferred
       order status to the IOTP Offer Response Block.  Alternatively,
       IOTP Application might determine the order status on its own.

       As in step 6, the rules and mechanisms of how this could be
       accomplished are out of the scope of this document.

   8.  The IOTP Application Core compiles the IOTP TPO Message including
       all compiled IOTP Blocks and transmits the message to the
       Consumer.  The IOTP Application Core terminates if an IOTP Offer
       Response Block has been created.

   9.  The Consumer performs the Brand Selection Steps (cf. <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>)
       and responds with a TPO Selection Block if no IOTP Offer Response
       Block has been received.  Otherwise, the following step is
       skipped.

   10. On brand dependent transactions, the IOTP Application Core
       requests the remaining payment scheme specific payment
       initialization data from the IOTP Payment Bridge ("Get Payment
       Initialization Data"), compiles the IOTP Offer Response Block,
       transmits it to the Consumer, and terminates.  Like Step 7, the
       IOTP Application Core might access the current process state of
       the IOTP Payment Bridge for the compilation of the order status.

   Any error during this process raises an IOTP Error Block.

   This section describes the steps that happen mainly after the
   Merchant's Brand Compilation (in a brand independent transaction).
   However, these steps might partially interlace the previous process
   (in a brand dependent transaction).

                  Figure 4. Brand Selection Message Flows

   1. The Merchant's commerce server controls the shopping dialog with
      its own mechanisms until the Consumer checks out the shopping cart
      and indicates his payment intention.  The subsequent processing
      switches to the IOTP based form by the activation of the
      Merchant's IOTP aware application.

   2. The IOTP Application Core compiles the IOTP Trading Protocol
      Options Block which contains the IOTP Brand List Component(s)
      enumerating Merchant's accepted payment brands and payment
      protocols and initiates the Brand Selection process.

   3. This first IOTP message activates the Consumer's IOTP aware
      application, e.g., the Web browser invokes a helper application
      (e.g., Java applet or external application).  Its IOTP Application
      Core

      o  infers the accepted payment brands, payment protocols, payment
         direction, currencies, payment amounts, any descriptions etc.,
         and their relationships from the IOTP message,

      o  determines the registered IOTP Payment Bridges,

      o  compiles one or multiple sets of brand and protocol such that
         the join of all sets describes exactly the payment alternatives
         being offered by the Merchant.

      o  inquires payment (protocol) support and the known payment
         instruments from each registered IOTP Payment Bridge for each
         compiled set ("Find Payment Instrument").  However, some IOTP
         Payment Bridges may refuse payment instrument distinction.

      The payment protocol support may differ between payment
      instruments if the IOTP Payment Bridge supports payment instrument
      distinction.

      These API calls are used to infer the payment alternatives at the
      startup of any payment transaction (without user unfriendly
      explicit user interaction).

      The IOTP Application Core must provide wallet identifiers, if they
      are requested by the IOTP Payment Bridges which signal their need
      by specific error codes (see below).

      It is recommended that the IOTP Application Core manages wallet
      identifiers.  But for security reasons, it should store pass
      phrases in plain text only in runtime memory.  Developers of IOTP



<span class="grey">Hans, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 22]</span></pre>

      Payment Bridges and payment software modules should provide a thin
      and fast implementation - without lengthy initialization processes
      - for this initial inquiry step.

   4. The IOTP Application Core verifies the Consumer's payment
      capabilities with the Merchant's accepted payment brands and
      currencies,

      o  displays the valid payment instruments and payment instrument
         independent payment brands (brand and protocol) together with
         their purchase parameters (payment direction, currency,
         amount), and

      o  requests the Consumer's choice or derives it automatically from
         any configured preferences.  Any selection ties one IOTP
         Payment Bridge with the following payment transaction.

      The handling and resolution of unavailable IOTP Payment Bridges
      during the inquiry in Step 3 is up to the IOTP Application Core.
      It may skip these IOTP Payment Bridges or may allow user supported
      resolution.

      Furthermore, it may offer the registration of new payment
      instruments when the Consumer is asked for payment instrument
      selection.

   5. The IOTP Application Core interrogates the fixed IOTP Payment
      Bridge whether the payment might complete with success ("Check
      Payment Possibility").  At this step, the IOTP Payment Bridge may
      issue several signals, e.g.,

      o  payment can proceed immediately,
      o  required peripheral inclusive of some required physical payment
         instrument (chip card) is unavailable,
      o  (non-IOTP) remote party (e.g., issuer, server wallet) is not
         available,
      o  wallet identifier or pass phrase is required,
      o  expired payment instrument (or certificate), insufficient
         funds, or
      o  physical payment instrument unreadable.

      In any erroneous case, the user should be notified and offered
      accurate alternatives.  Most probably, the user might be offered

      o  to resolve the problem, e.g., to insert another payment
         instrument or to verify the periphery,
      o  to proceed (assuming its success),
      o  to cancel the whole transaction, or



<span class="grey">Hans, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 23]</span></pre>

      o  to suspend the transaction, e.g., initiating a nested
         transaction for uploading an electronic purse.

      If the payment software implements payment instrument selection on
      its own, it may request the Consumer's choice at this step.

      If the check succeeds, it returns several IOTP Brand Selection
      Info Elements.

   6. The Steps 2 to 5 are repeated and possibly interlaced for the
      selection of the second payment instrument during IOTP Value
      Exchange transactions - this is omitted in the figure above.

   7. The IOTP Brand Selection Component is generated and enriched with
      the Brand Selection Info elements.  This component is transmitted
      to the Merchant inside a TPO Selection Block if the received IOTP
      message lacks the IOTP Offer Response Block.  The Merchant will
      then respond with an IOTP Offer Response Block (following the
      aforementioned compilation rules).

                  Figure 5. Example Payment Message Flows

   1. After Brand Selection and receipt of the IOTP Offer Response
      Block, the Consumer switches from communicating with the Merchant
      to communicating with the Payment Handler.

      This might be a milestone requiring the renewed Consumer's
      agreement about the payment transaction's continuation.
      Particularly, this is a good moment for payment suspension (and
      even cancellation), which will be most probably supported by all
      payment schemes.  Simply, because the actual payment legacy
      systems have not yet been involved in the current transaction.

      Such an agreement might be explicit per transaction or automatic
      based on configured preferences, e.g., early acknowledgments for
      specific payment limits.

      It is assumed, that the transaction proceeds with minimal user
      (Consumer and Payment Handler) interaction and that its progress
      is controlled by the IOTP Application Core and IOTP Payment
      Bridge.

   2. In order to open the actual payment transaction, the IOTP
      Application Core issues the "Start Payment Consumer" request
      towards the IOTP Payment Bridge.  This request carries the whole
      initialization data of the payment transaction being referred to
      by the IOTP Payment Bridge for subsequent consistency checks:

      o  payment brand and its description from the selected Brand
         Element of the IOTP Brand List Component,
      o  payment instrument from preceding inquiry step,





<span class="grey">Hans, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 25]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-26" id="page-26" name="page-26"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3867.html">RFC 3867</a>                  Payment API for IOTP             November 2004</span>


      o  further payment parameters (currency, amount, direction,
         expiration) from the selected Currency Amount element, Brand
         List Component, and Payment Component of the IOTP Offer
         Response Block,
      o  payment protocol from the selected IOTP Pay Protocol Element,
      o  order details contained in the IOTP Order Component which might
         be payment scheme specific,
      o  payment scheme specific data inclusive of the payment protocol
         descriptions from the IOTP Protocol Amount Element, and IOTP
         Pay Protocol Element, and
      o  payment scheme specific data inclusive of the payment protocol
         descriptions, in which the name attribute includes the prefix
         as "Payment:" from the Trading Role Data Component.

      Generally, the called API function re-does most checks of the
      "Check Payment Possibility" call due to lack of strong
      dependencies between both requests: There might be a significant
      delay between both API requests.

      The called API function may return further payment scheme specific
      data being considered as payment specific initialization data for
      the Payment Handler's IOTP Payment Bridge.

      If the fixed Existing Payment Software implements payment
      instrument selection on its own, it may request the Consumer's
      choice at this step.

      The IOTP Payment Bridge reports lack of capability quite similarly
      to the "Check Payment Possibility" request to the IOTP Application
      Core.  The Consumer may decide to resolve the problem, to suspend,
      or to cancel the transaction, but this function call must succeed
      in order to proceed with the transaction.

      Developers of payment modules may decide to omit payment
      instrument related checks like expiration date or refunds
      sufficiency, if such checks are part of the specific payment
      protocol.

      If the IOTP Payment Bridge requests wallet identifiers or pass
      phrases anywhere during the payment process, they should be
      requested by this API function, too.  It is recommended that the
      IOTP Application Core stores plain text pass phrases only in
      runtime memory.

      Finally, the IOTP Application Core generates the IOTP Payment
      Request Block, inserts any returned payment scheme data, and
      submits it to the Payment Handler's system.




<span class="grey">Hans, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 26]</span></pre>

   3. The Payment Handler's IOTP Application Core opens the payment
      transaction calling the "Start Payment Payment Handler" API
      function.  The payment brand, its description, payment protocol,
      payment specific data, payment direction, currency and payment
      amount are determined quite similar to the Consumer's IOTP
      Application Core.  Furthermore, the content of the IOTP Payment
      Scheme Component and the IOTP Brand Selection Info Elements are
      passed to this function.

      On success, the Payment Handler's IOTP Payment Bridge responds
      with payment scheme specific data.  On failures, this non-
      interactive server application has to resolve any problems on its
      own or to give up aborting the payment transaction.  However, the
      Consumer may restart the whole payment transaction.  Anyway, the
      payment log file should reflect any trials of payments.

      Eventually, the Payment Handler informs the Consumer about the
      current IOTP Process State using the IOTP Payment Response or IOTP
      Error Block.

      Note that the "Start Payment Payment Handler" call might return
      the Continuation Status "End" such that payment processing
      proceeds with Step 7.

   4. The IOTP Application Core verifies the presence of the Payment
      Exchange Block in the IOTP message and passes the contained
      payment scheme specific data to the fixed IOTP Payment Bridge
      ("Continue Process") which returns the next IOTP Payment Scheme
      Component.

      This Payment Scheme Component is encapsulated in an IOTP Payment
      Exchange Block and transmitted to the Payment Handler.

   5. The Payment Handler's IOTP Application Core verifies the presence
      of the Payment Exchange Block and passes the contained payment
      scheme specific data to the fixed IOTP Payment Bridge ("Continue
      Process") which returns the next IOTP Payment Scheme Component for
      encapsulation and transmission to the Consumer.

   6. The payment process continues with IOTP Payment Exchange Block
      exchanges, carrying the payment scheme specific data.  Each party
      (1) submits the embedded payment scheme specific data
      transparently to the appropriate IOTP Payment Bridge calling the
      "Continue Process" API function, (2) wraps the returned payment
      scheme specific data into an IOTP Payment Exchange Block, and (3)
      transmits this block to the counter party.

      However, the processing of the payment scheme specific data may
      fail for several reasons.  These are signaled by specific error
      codes which are transformed to IOTP Payment Response Blocks
      (generated by Payment Handler) or IOTP Error Blocks (both parties
      may generate them) and transmitted to the counter party.

   7. Eventually, the Payment Handler's IOTP Payment Bridge recognizes
      the termination of the payment transaction and reports this by the
      continuation status "End" on the output parameter of "Continue
      Process" (or "Start Payment Payment Handler").  Then, the IOTP
      Application Core issues the "Inquire Process State" API call and
      verifies whether an IOTP Payment Receipt Component has been
      returned.  The IOTP Application Core wraps the payment receipt,
      the status response, and the optional payment scheme specific data
      in an IOTP Payment Response Block and transmits this block to the
      Consumer.

      However, any of these API calls may fail or any response might be
      incomplete (e.g., lack of payment receipt).  Then, the Consumer
      has to be notified about the failed processing by an IOTP Error
      Block.

      Finally, the Payment Handler terminates the payment transaction
      with the "Change Process State" API call without awaiting any
      further response from the Consumer.  Further failures are not
      reported to the Consumer.

      Note that it might be possible that the Consumer's IOTP Payment
      Bridge has returned the previous payment scheme specific data with
      the continuation status "End".  Even in the absence of this
      knowledge - this status is not exchanged between the Consumer and
      the Payment Handler - the Payment Handler must not supply any
      further payment scheme specific data.  Such data will be rejected
      by the Consumer's IOTP Payment Bridge.

   8. The Consumer passes the optional payment scheme specific data and
      the payment receipt to the fixed IOTP Payment Bridge by "Continue
      Process" and "Check Payment Receipt" API calls.

      Afterwards, the IOTP Application Core issues the "Inquire Process
      State" API call and verifies whether extensions to the payment
      receipt have been returned.

      Finally, the transaction is terminated by calling the "Change
      Process State" API function which verifies and synchronizes the
      reported payment status with the local one and signals any
      inconsistencies.  Any Inconsistency and returned status text
      should be displayed to the Consumer.

      At this point, the payment transaction has already been closed by
      the Payment Handler.  Therefore, any failure has to be resolved
      locally or out-of-band.

   In Baseline IOTP, Payment inquiries are initiated by the Consumer in
   order to verify the current payment progress and process state at the
   remote Payment Handler.  In the figure 6, PS1 and PS2 indicate the

                  Figure 6. Remote Process State Inquiry

   1. The Consumer might initiate a payment inquiry once the payment
      transaction has been opened by the IOTP Application Core, i.e., at
      any time after the initial submission of the IOTP Payment Request
      Block.  The IOTP Application Core requests any additional specific
      payment scheme data from the IOTP Payment Bridge which has been
      fixed during brand selection (cf. <a href="#section-2.3">Section 2.3</a>) using the "Start
      Payment Inquiry" API request.

      Erroneous API responses should be reported to the Consumer and
      valid alternatives (typically retry and cancellation) should be
      presented by the IOTP Application Core.

      This request might perform the complete initialization, e.g.,
      availability check of periphery or pass phrase supplement, and the
      IOTP Payment Bridge reports lack of capability quite similarly to
      the "Check Payment Possibility" request to the IOTP Application
      Core.

      If the IOTP Payment Bridge requests wallet identifiers or pass
      phrases anywhere during the payment process, they should be
      requested by this API function, too.  It is recommended that the
      IOTP Application Core store plain text pass phrases only in
      runtime memory.

      The IOTP Application Core encapsulates any Payment Scheme
      Component in an IOTP Inquiry Request Block and submits the block
      to the Payment Handler.

   2. The Payment Handler analyses the IOTP Inquire Request Block, maps
      the Transaction Identifier to payment related attributes (brand,
      consumer and payment identifiers), determines the appropriate IOTP
      Payment Bridge, and forwards the request to the this IOTP Payment
      Bridge ("Inquire Payment Status").  The IOTP Application Core
      transforms the response to an IOTP Inquiry Response Block and
      transmits it to the Consumer.

   3. On receipt of the respective IOTP Inquiry Response Block the
      Consumer's IOTP Application Core submits any encapsulated payment
      scheme specific data to the IOTP Payment Bridge for verification
      ("Continue Process").

   4. The IOTP Application Core passes the reported payment status
      (except textual descriptions) to the IOTP Payment Bridge ("Change
      Process State") for verification purposes and payment status
      change.  The IOTP Payment Bridge reports any inconsistencies as
      well as the final payment status to the IOTP Application Core.

      Any additional information that might be of interest to the
      Consumer has to be displayed by the IOTP Payment Bridge or
      Existing Payment Software on their own.

   The IOTP specification distinguishes between several classes of
   failures:

      o  Business and technical errors
      o  Error depths of transport, message and block level
      o  Transient errors, warnings, and hard errors.

   Any IOTP Payment API has to deal with the receipt of failure
   notifications by and failure responses.  This proposal has borrowed
   the basic mechanisms for error reporting between the IOTP Application
   Core and the IOTP Payment Bridge from the actual protocol: Business



<span class="grey">Hans, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 30]</span></pre>

   errors are reported by Status Components within IOTP Response Blocks
   while technical errors are signaled by Error Components within IOTP
   Error Blocks.

   Cancellations are mimicked as specific business errors which might be
   initiated by each trading party.

   Preferring slim interfaces, this IOTP Payment API introduces one
   additional Error Code value for business error indication - errors
   can be raised on every API call.  On receipt of this value, the IOTP
   Application Core has to infer further details by the issuance of the
   API function call "Inquire Process State".

   The specific Completion Codes "ConsCancelled", "MerchCancelled", and
   "PaymCancelled" - returned by "Inquire Process State" - determine
   that the IOTP Cancel Block has to be created instead of an IOTP Error
   Block.

   The rules for determining the required behavior of the IOTP
   Application Core are given in the IOTP specification.

   Note that any payment (intermediate) termination, i.e., failures,
   cancellations, and even successes are always reported to the IOTP
   Payment Bridge by the API function "Change Process State".  This API
   function does both status changes and consistency checking /
   synchronization.  Any suspicion of inconsistency should be reported
   by the IOTP Payment Bridge for display by the IOTP Application Core.

             Figure 8.  Error Notification from counter party

   Not every failure might be visible at the IOTP layer, e.g., the
   processing of payment transactions might temporarily be hampered by
   intermediate failures at the payment scheme or protocol transport
   layer which might be resolved by the actual components.

   However, final failures or cancellations have to be reported at the
   IOTP layer.  E.g., communication time-outs and heavily faulty
   communication channels may disable the transaction.

   Any system component may implement time-out recognition and use the
   aforementioned API mechanisms for the notification of process state
   changes.  But, time-outs may happens while communicating with both
   the counter party and local system components, like chip card readers
   or IOTP Payment Bridges.  Anyway, the Consumer's IOTP Application
   Core should notify the Consumer about the resolution alternatives,
   i.e., retry, suspension, and cancellation.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.6.2.%20%20Resumption"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.6.2" name="section-2.6.2">2.6.2</a>.  Resumption</span>

   Payment transaction resumption may apply at different steps of a
   payment transaction:

   o  The Consumer's and Payment Handler's view of the transaction might
      not be synchronized: Due to different time-out values the payment
      transaction may not have been suspended by the counter party.

      Any "Resume Payment ..." API function responds with an Error Code
      on non-suspended payment transaction that signals a business
      error.  Afterwards the IOTP Application Core has to issue the
      "Inquire Process State" API call for further analysis of the
      process state.

   o  One IOTP message sent by one party might not be processed
      successfully or even received by the counter party.  This needs to
      be handled by the actual payment scheme.  It is expected that the
      IOTP Application Core will not recognize anything.






<span class="grey">Hans, et al.                 Informational                     [Page 32]</span></pre>

   o  IOTP does not provide any specific signal for payment resumption.
      On receipt of every IOTP Payment Exchange Block, the IOTP
      Application Core has to decide whether this Block belongs to a
      pending transaction or to a suspended transaction that should be
      resumed.  The IOTP Application Core might call the "Inquire
      Process State" API function to update any lack of knowledge.

      Any "Resume Payment" API function responds with an Error Code on
      non-suspended payment transaction that signals a business error.
      Similar, the "Continue Process" API function should report
      business errors on non-pending payment transactions.

   o  The payment transaction may not have been created at the Payment
      Handler (early suspension and failed data transmission).  In that
      case, the IOTP Application Core should respond with a business
      error that signals the repetition of the payment transaction (by
      the Consumer).

      Any "Resume Payment", "Continue Process" or "Inquire Process
      State" API function should return with an Error Code
      "AttValIllegal" on non-existent payment transaction whereby the
      further Error Attribute "Names" denote the payment identifier.

   o  The IOTP Application Core should always request fresh payment
      scheme specific data on resumption - for synchronization purposes
      with the Existing Payment Software.  Old data in the cache that
      has not been sent to the counter party should not be accessed.

   If the Consumer does not reconnect within an acceptable amount of
   time, the Payment Handler's system may perform local failure
   resolution in order to close the transaction and to retain resources
   for other transactions ("Change Process State").  If the Consumer
   reconnect afterwards, an IOTP Payment Response or IOTP Error Block
   could be generated.

   At startup or on explicit user request the IOTP Application Core
   should check its IOTP Payment Bridges' internal status by searching
   for pending payment transactions.

   1. The IOTP Application Core interrogates the registered IOTP Payment
      Bridges about pending payment transactions.  The IOTP Application
      Core may store indicators for pending transactions and use them
      for driving any subsequent inquiry ("Inquire Pending Payment").

   2. If one or more IOTP Payment Bridges report the presence of pending
      transactions, the IOTP Application Core may try to suspend
      ("Change Process State") or resume (only Consumer: "Resume Payment
      Consumer") the pending transactions (on user request).

   The IOTP Payment Bridge may deny the processing of any new payment
   transactions until the pending transactions have been processed.
   Such denials are signaled by the error code "Business Error".

   The IOTP Application Core provides only a simple and generic
   interface for the registration of new payment methods / instruments
   ("Manage Payment Software").  It receives the initial user request
   and defers the actual registration to the corresponding IOTP Payment
   Bridge.

   The IOTP Application Core may also activate the Existing Payment
   Software for further payment instrument and wallet administration.

   The Payment API is formalized using the eXtensible Markup Language
   (XML).  It defines wrapper elements for both the input parameters and
   the API function's response.  In particular, the response wrapper
   provides common locations for Error Codes and Error Descriptions.

   It is anticipated that this description reflects the logical
   structure of the API parameter and might be used to derive
   implementation language specific API definitions.

   Most of the attribute items are intended for immediate insertion in
   the IOTP Error Block.  The attribute values of the Error Location
   elements attribute have to enriched and transformed into Error
   Location Elements of the Error Component (cf. IOTP Specification).

   Attributes (cf. IOTP Specification):

   xml:lang           Defines the language used by attributes or
                      child elements within this component, unless
                      overridden by an xml:lang attribute on a child
                      element.

   ContentSoftwareId  Contains information which identifies the
                      software that generated the content of the
                      element.  Its purpose is to help resolve
                      interoperability problems that might occur as
                      a result of incompatibilities between messages
                      produced by different software.  It is a single
                      text string in the language defined by
                      "xml:lang".  It must contain, as a minimum
                      problems that might occur as a result of

                      o  the name of the software manufacturer,
                      o  the name of the software,
                      o  the version of the software, and
                      o  the build of the software.

   ErrorCode          Contains an error code which indicates the
                      nature of the error in the message in error.
                      Valid values for the Error Code are given in
                      the following section.  This mnemonic enables
                      the automatic failure resolution of the IOTP
                      Application Core which analyzes the error code
                      value in order to determine the continuation
                      alternatives.

   ErrorDesc          Contains a description of the error in the
                      language defined by xml:lang.  The content of
                      this attribute is defined by the
                      vendor/developer of the software that
                      generated the Error Response Element.
                      It is intended for user display and provides
                      detailed explanations about the failure and
                      its (out-of-band) resolution alternatives.

   Severity           Indicates the severity of the error.  Valid
                      values are:

                      o  Warning.  This indicates that although there
                         is a message in error the IOTP Transaction
                         can still continue.

                      o  TransientError.  This indicates that the
                         error in the message in error may be
                         recovered if the message in error that is
                         referred to by the "Names" attribute is
                         resent.

                      o  HardError.  This indicates that there is an
                         unrecoverable error in the message in error
                         and the IOTP Transaction must stop.

   MinRetrySecs       This attribute should be present if "Severity"
                      is set to "TransientError".  It is the minimum
                      number of whole seconds which the IOTP aware
                      application which received the message
                      reporting the error should wait before
                      resending the message in error identified by
                      the "ErrorLocation" attribute.

                      If Severity is not set to
                      "TransientError" then the value of this
                      attribute is ignored.

   SwVendorErrorRef   This attribute is a reference whose value is
                      set by the vendor/developer of the software
                      that generated the Error Element.  It should
                      contain data that enables the vendor to
                      identify the precise location in their
                      software and the set of circumstances that
                      caused the software to generate a message
                      reporting the error.

   Content:

   ErrorLocation      This identifies, where possible, the
                      element and attribute in the message
                      in error that caused the Error
                      Element to be generated.  If the
                      "Severity" of the error is not
                      "TransientError", more that one
                      "ErrorLocation" may be specified as
                      appropriate depending on the nature
                      of the error and at the discretion of
                      the vendor/developer of the IOTP
                      Payment Bridge.

                      Its definition coincides with the
                      IOTP specification whereby the
                      attributes "IotpMsgRef", "BlkRef" and
                      "CompRef" are left blank,
                      intentionally.

   PaySchemePackagedContent  cf. Table 5

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Error%20Codes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Error Codes</span>

   The following table lists the valid values for the ErrorCode
   attribute of the Error Response Element.  The first sentence of the
   error description contains the default text that can be used to
   describe the error when displayed or otherwise reported.  Individual
   implementations may translate this into alternative languages at
   their discretion.  However, not every error code may apply to every
   API call.  An Error Code must not be more than 14 characters long.
   The Error Codes have been taken from the IOTP Specification and
   extended by some additional codes which are highlighted by a
   preceding asterisk.

   Generally, if the corrupt values have been user supplied, the IOTP
   Application Core might prompt for their correction.  If the renewal
   fails or if the IOTP Application Core skips any renewals and some
   notification has to be send to the counter-party, the error code is
   encapsulated within an IOTP Error Block.

   However, the IOTP server application reports business errors -
   visible at the IOTP layer - in the Status Component of the respective
   Response Block.

   The IOTP Application Core may add the attributes (and values) within
   the ErrorLocation elements that are omitted by the IOTP Payment
   Bridge.

   The following table mentions any modification from this general
   processing for particular error values.  Furthermore, it contains
   hints for developers of IOTP Application Core software components
   about the processing of error codes.  Conversely, developers of IOTP
   Payment Bridges get impressions about the expected behavior of the
   IOTP Application Core.

   The IOTP Payment API assumes that the IOTP Application Core
   implements the dialog boxes needed for error resolution.  But it does
   not assume, that the IOTP Payment Bridge actually relies on them.
   Instead, the IOTP Payment Bridge may try resolution on its own, may
   implement specific dialog boxes, and may signal only final failures.

   Note: This abstract document assumes that the API parameters are
   exchanged XML encoded.  Therefore, several error values might
   disappear in lower level language specific derivations.

                      PaymentInstrumentId: illegal/unknown
                      Payment Instrument Identifier - This
                      indicates a serious communication problem if
                      the attribute value has been reported by the
                      same "wallet" on a previous inquiry
                      requests.  The IOTP Application Core has to
                      replace the error code with
                      "UnknownError" before transmission to the
                      counter party.

                      WalletId: illegal/unknown Wallet Identifier
                      - It is assumed that the wallet identifier
                      is checked before the pass phrase.  On
                      invalid wallet identifiers, the IOTP
                      Application Core may open the dialog in
                      order to request the correct wallet
                      identifier.  In addition, any pass phrase may
                      be supplied by the user.  The dialog should
                      indicate the respective payment brand(s).
                      The IOTP Application Core has to replace the
                      error code with "UnknownError" before
                      transmission to the counter party.

                      Passphrase:   illegal/unknown Pass Phrase -
                      The IOTP Application Core may open the
                      dialog in order to request the correct pass
                      phrase.  If the pass phrase is wallet
                      identifier specific the dialog should
                      display the wallet identifier.  The IOTP
                      Application Core has to replace the error
                      code with "TransportError" before

                      that are inconsistent.

   TransportError     Transport Error.  This error code is used to
                      indicate that there is a problem with the
                      transport mechanism that is preventing the
                      message from being received.  It is typically
                      associated with a "Transient Error".

   MsgBeingProc       Message Being Processed.  This error code is
                      only used with a Severity of Transient
                      Error.  It indicates that the previous

   SystemBusy         System Busy.  This error code is only used
                      with a Severity of Transient Error.  It
                      indicates that the IOTP Payment Bridge or

                      chip card".

                      The Consumer's IOTP Application Core may
                      display the error description and ask the
                      Consumer about the continuation -
                      alternatives are retry, payment transaction
                      suspension, and cancellation.

                      that are inconsistent.

                      The IOTP Application Core has to replace the
                      error code with "XmlNotValid" or
                      "UnknownError" before transmission to the

   (*)ReqRefused      Request refused.  The API request is
                      (currently) refused by the IOTP Payment
                      Bridge.  The error description may provide

                      counter party's IOTP Application Core.
                      Otherwise, it maps to "TransportError" or
                      "UnknownError".

   (*)BusError        Business Error.  The API request has been
                      rejected because some payment transaction
                      has an illegal payment status.
                      Particularly, this error code is used to

   The IOTP Payment Bridge may also use the error description in order
   to notify the Consumer about further necessary steps for failure
   resolution, e.g., "Sorry, your payment transaction failed.
   Unfortunately, you have been charged, please contact your issuer."

   AmountTo  (11)      For example $245.35 would be expressed
                       "245.35".  Note that values smaller than the
                       smallest denomination are allowed.  For
                       example one tenth of a cent would be

   BrandId  (128)      This contains a unique identifier for the
                       brand (or promotional brand).  It is used to
                       match against a list of Payment Instruments
                       which the Consumer holds to determine
                       whether or not the Consumer can pay with the
                       Brand.

                       Values of BrandId are managed under
                       procedure being described in the IOTP
                       protocol specification.

   BrandLogoNetLocn    The net location which can be used to
                       download the logo for the organization (cf.
                       IOTP Specification).

                       The content of this attribute must conform
                       to [<a href="#ref-URL" title='"Uniform Resource Locators (URL)"'>URL</a>].

   BrandName           This contains the name of the brand, for
                       example "MasterCard Credit".  This is the
                       description of the Brand which is displayed
                       to the consumer in the Consumer's language
                       defined by "xml:lang".  For example it might
                       be "American Airlines Advantage Visa".  Note
                       that this attribute is not used for matching
                       against the payment instruments held by the
                       Consumer.

   BrandNarrative      This optional attribute is
                       used by the Merchant to indicate some
                       special conditions or benefit which would
                       apply if the Consumer selected that brand.
                       For example "5% discount", "free shipping
                       and handling", "free breakage insurance for
                       1 year", "double air miles apply", etc.

   CallBackFunction    A function which is called whenever there is
                       a change of Process State or payment
                       progress, e.g., for display updates.  However,
                       the IOTP Payment Bridge may use its own
                       mechanisms and dialog boxes.

   CallBackLanguageList
                       A list of language codes which contain, in
                       order of preference, the languages in which
                       the text passed to the Call Back function
                       will be encoded.

   CompletionCode (14) Indicates how the process completed.
                       It is required if ProcessState is set to
                       "Failed" otherwise it is ignored.  Valid
                       values as well as recovery options are given
                       in the IOTP specification.

                       The IOTP Payment Bridge may also use the
                       Status Description to notify the Consumer
                       about further necessary steps in order to
                       resolve some kind of business failures,
                       e.g.,

                       o  "sorry, your payment transaction failed.
                          Unfortunately, you have been charged,
                          please contact your issuer."
                       o  "insufficient capacity left (on your
                          stored value card) for refund",
                       o  "payment failed/chip card error/internal
                          error, please contact your payment
                          instrument's issuer"

   ConsumerDesc        A narrative description of the Consumer.

   ConsumerPayId (14)  An unique identifier specified by the
                       Consumer that, if returned by the Payment
                       Handler in another Payment Scheme Component
                       or by other means, enables the Consumer to
                       identify which payment is being referred to.

                       This unique identifier is generated by the
                       IOTP Application Core and submitted to the
                       IOTP Payment Bridge on every API call.  It
                       may equal the Payment Handler Payment
                       Identifiers but need not necessarily be so.

                       The uniqueness extends to multiple payment
                       instruments, payment brands, payment
                       protocols, wallet identifiers, and even
                       multiple IOTP Payment Bridges.

   ContStatus          During payment progress, this status value
                       indicates whether the payment needs to be
                       continued with further IOTP Payment Scheme
                       Component exchanges with the remote party.
                       "End" indicates that the reported payment
                       scheme data is the last data to be exchanged
                       with the counter party.

   CurrCode  (14)      A code which identifies the currency to be
                       used in the payment.  The domain of valid
                       currency codes is defined by "CurrCodeType"

   MerchantPayId  (14) An private identifier specified by the
                       Merchant which will enable the Merchant to
                       identify which payment is being referred to.
                       It is a pure private item and is never sent
                       to any other party.  It is provided by the
                       IOTP Payment Bridge on payment preparation
                       during brand compilation.

   PropertyType  (14)  The property type defines codes used for
                       interrogation of specific properties about a
                       payment instrument.  They are unique for each
                       payment brand.  The predefined property "all"
                       is used on general inquiries.  However, these
                       property types are not used during normal
                       payment processing.  E.g., they may apply to
                       payment brand specific transactions or
                       out-of-band failure resolution.

   PropertyDesc        The property description carries the
                       respective human readable property (value)'s
                       description.

   PropertyValue       The actual property value intends automatic
                       post processing.

   ProtocolBrandId (64)This is an identifier to be used with a
                       particular payment protocol.  For example,
                       SET and EMV have their own well defined, yet
                       different, values for the Brand identifier
                       to be used with each protocol.  The valid values
                       of this attribute are defined in the
                       supplement for the payment protocol
                       identified by "ProtocolId" that describes
                       how the payment protocol works with IOTP.
                       Identifier maps to at most one Protocol
                       Brand Identifier.

   The IOTP Payment API supports six different attribute values that
   encode the transaction status from the IOTP's point of view, i.e.,
   the appropriate point of view at the interface between the IOTP
   Application Core and IOTP Payment Bridge.  This point of view does
   not completely mimic the more detailed view on the actual payment by
   the actual Existing Payment Software or IOTP Payment Bridge.

   The following three tables distinguish between the Merchant's,
   Consumer's, and Payment Handlers' environment.  They extend the
   aforementioned explanations towards the mapping between IOTP process
   states and the internal payment scheme related states of the Existing
   Payment Software/IOTP Payment Bridge.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.1.%20%20Merchant"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3.1" name="section-3.3.1">3.3.1</a>.  Merchant</span>

   The Merchant's point of view of payment is limited to the local
   payment initiation being interlaced with order processing because
   IOTP assigns the actual payment processing to the Payment Handler.

   ProcessState        Description
   ------------        -----------

   NotYetStarted       The Payment Transaction exists within the
                       IOTP Application Core, i.e., the
                       Merchant's shop has already signaled to
                       the IOTP Application Core that an IOTP
                       transaction has been initiated by the
                       Consumer.

                       However, neither any API call has been
                       issued to the IOTP Payment Bridge nor has
                       the IOTP Order Request has been created.

   InProgress          The IOTP Application changes the process
                       state to this value when it issues the
                       first API call to the Payment Bridge
                       during Brand List compilation.

                       This value indicates that the Payment
                       Bridge might have some knowledge about
                       the expected payment or might have
                       performed some preparatory tasks (even
                       with the Payment Handler out-of-band to
                       IOTP).

                       However, this value does not indicate
                       that any IOTP Order Request has been
                       created and transmitted to the Consumer.

   Suspended           The IOTP transaction has been suspended
                       before the order request block has been
                       transmitted to the Consumer.

                       Implicitly, the payment is also deferred.

   CompletedOk         The IOTP Order Request has been
                       successfully created and transmitted to
                       the Consumer.  Actually, this process
                       state indicates only that the order
                       processing has been finished.

                       But it contains no indication about the
                       status of the actual payment, which is
                       accepted by the Payment Handler.

                       However, successful order processing
                       signals the IOTP Application Core that a
                       payment with some specific parameters is
                       expected within the near future.  And this
                       signal might be used by the Existing
                       Payment Software for similar purposes.
                       This attribute might be interpreted as
                       successful preparation of the payment
                       system.

                       Particularly, it is expected that the
                       Existing Payment Software maps this IOTP
                       status value to some other internal
                       value, e.g., "NotYetStarted", that is more
                       accurate from its point of view.

                       As IOTP provides no communication channel
                       between the Merchant and Payment Handler,
                       any change of payment process state will

                       However, the ideal point of view of IOTP

   The Consumer's IOTP Application Core restricts its point of view to
   the payment transaction.  It is assumed that the IOTP Payment Bridge
   handles the preceding brand selection process in a stateless manner.

   ProcessState        Description
   ------------        -----------

   NotYetStarted       This encodes the initial process state of
                       any IOTP payment transaction.  This value
                       is set during brand selection but it
                       normally will not change during the whole brand
                       selection process.

   InProgress          With the issuance of the Start Payment
                       Consumer API call, the IOTP Application
                       Core changes the process state to this
                       value.

   Suspended           The payment transaction has been
                       suspended.  Suspension may occur anywhere
                       during brand selection (with the
                       Merchant) or payment processing (with the
                       Payment Handler).  On resumption, the IOTP
                       Application Core and the IOTP Payment
                       Bridge have to use other internal data to
                       decide whether brand selection or actual
                       payment processing needs to be continued,
                       i.e., whether the process state needs to
                       be reset to "NotYetStarted" or
                       "InProgress".

                       Note that the Payment API assumes
                       stateless brand selection by the IOTP
                       Payment Bridge.  Typically, any suspension
                       during brand selection requires the
                       repetition of the whole process.  Hereby,
                       the IOTP Application Core might need to
                       consider any already negotiated
                       conditions in a brand depended purchase
                       (brand, protocol).

   CompletedOk         The successful payment has been
                       acknowledged by the Payment Handler, i.e.,
                       the successful IOTP Payment Response has
                       been received.

                       Implicitly, this implies successful order
                       processing.

   The Payment Handler is responsible for the actual payment processing.
   New payment transactions are reported by the Consumer with the
   transmission of new IOTP Payment Request Blocks.  IOTP Payment
   Exchange Block are send by the Consumer for payment transaction
   continuation and resumption.

   ProcessState        Description
   ------------        -----------

   NotYetStarted       This encodes the initial process state of
                       any payment transaction.  Typically, this
                       value will last for a short amount of
                       time.

   InProgress          The IOTP Application Core changes the
                       process state changes to "InProgress"
                       when the Payment Handler starts with the
                       actual processing of the IOTP Payment
                       Request Block.

                       Note that this does not assume that the
                       "StartPaymentPaymentHandler" API function
                       has been called.

   This API function determines the instances of payment protocols (and
   optionally the payment brands) being accepted by the Payment Handler
   on behalf of the Merchant.  The function might be called in two
   variants:

   o  With the Brand Identifier set on the input parameter list: The
      function responds with the payment protocols that fits to the
      submitted brand.

   o  Without any Brand Identifier - that allows the omission of the
      "Find Accepted Payment Brand" API call (cf. <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>): This
      function responds with both the supported brand identifiers and
      the payment protocols being specified by the Brand Elements.

   Input Parameters

   o  Brand Identifier - returned by "Find Accepted Payment Brand"
   o  Payment Direction
   o  Currency Code and Currency
   o  Payment Amount
   o  Merchant Payment Identifier - Merchant's unique private
      reference to the payment transaction
   o  Merchant Organisation Identifier - used for distinction between
      multiple merchants that share the some IOTP merchant system
   o  Wallet Identifier - managed by the IOTP Application Core
   o  (Brand) Packaged Content - further payment brand description;
      returned by "Find Accepted Payment Brand"; this elements are
      only provided if the Brand Identifier is set
   o  Merchant Data - specific data used by the IOTP Payment Bridge
      which is managed in the IOTP Application Core.

   This API function inquires any payment protocol specific
   authentication challenge value from the IOTP Payment Bridge.  In
   Baseline IOTP this API function is called by the Merchant (or
   Financial Institution).  The IOTP Application Core may propose a
   choice of algorithms to the IOTP Payment Bridge.  However, the IOTP
   Payment Bridge may ignore the proposal and select some other
   algorithm.

   The inquiry is assumed to be stateless.  E.g., the IOTP Application
   Core may check the returned algorithm and stop transaction processing
   without notifying the IOTP Payment Bridge.

   The IOTP Application Core may issue several API calls to the IOTP
   Payment Bridge to build up the IOTP Authentication Request Block.
   Any subsequently submitted choice of algorithms should be constrained
   by the accepted algorithms from earlier API responses.

   The IOTP Payment Bridge responds with the Business Error Code if it
   does not provide any (more) authentication algorithms and challenges.

   Input Parameters

   o  Authentication Identifier - the authenticator may provide its

      Identifier.
   o  Wallet Identifier and/or Pass Phrase
   o  set of pre-selected algorithms for authentication

   The Consumer's IOTP Application Core defers payment protocol specific
   authentication processing and the current challenge value to the
   active IOTP Payment Bridge.  Alternative authentication algorithms
   might be tried sequentially or offered to the user for selection.

   Note that the IOTP Application Core has to consider both the current
   context and the algorithm in order to determine the responsible IOTP
   Payment Bridge.

   Failed authentication is reported by the Business Error Code which
   might trigger the inquiry of the details ("Inquire Process State").
   Final failures might be encoded by the process state "Failed".

   This API function verifies the Consumer's payment protocol specific
   authentication response.  In Baseline IOTP this API function is
   called by the Merchant (or the Financial Institution).  It is called
   only if the counter party has responded with an IOTP Authentication
   Response Component within the Authentication Response Block.  Of
   course, the IOTP Application Core traces the need of such an
   response.

   Due to the authentication's statelessness, all parameters (algorithm,
   challenge and response) are submitted to the IOTP Payment Bridge.
   Authentication failure is reported by a Process State different from
   "CompletedOK".

   This API function determines which instances of a Payment Brand,
   e.g., two Mondex cards, are present.  The same physical card may even
   represent multiple payment instruments.

   The IOTP Application Core supplies possible payment brand and payment
   protocol to the IOTP Payment Bridge that has to be considered when
   the IOTP Payment Bridge searches for appropriate payment instruments.
   This set represents the (sub)set of payment alternatives being
   supported by the Merchant.  If the IOTP Application Cote has multiple
   possible payment brand/protocol, it can call this function in turn.

   The Existing Payment Software responds with PayInstrument Elements
   with empty PayInstId attributes if it does not distinguish between
   different payment instruments for the particular payment
   alternatives.

   Note that the Payment API assumes that the values of the attributes
   BrandId, ProtocolId, ProtocolBrandId and the currency amount suffice
   for the determination of the appropriate Packaged Content Element
   that will be transmitted to the Payment Handler later on.

   Input Parameters

   o  Brand Identifier - copied from the Brand List Component's Brand
      Element
   o  Payment Protocol Identifier and associated Protocol Brand
      Identifier
   o  Payment Direction - copied from the Brand List Component
   o  Currency Code and Currency - copied from the Currency Amount
      Element
   o  Payment Amount - copied from the Currency Amount Element
   o  Consumer Payment Identifier - Consumer's unique reference to
      the current payment transaction
   o  Wallet Identifier - managed by the IOTP Application Core
   o  (Brand) Packaged Content - further payment brand description;
      copied from the Brand List Component's Brand Element
   o  (Protocol Brand) Element - further information; copied from the
      Protocol Brand Element of the Brand List Component which
      relates to the Consumer selected Brand Element, if any.

      payment instruments or if there are no registered payment
      instruments available despite brand support for at least one
      (unspecified) payment protocol.  In the latter case, the IOTP

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.2.%20%20Check%20Payment%20Possibility"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.2" name="section-4.2.2">4.2.2</a>.  Check Payment Possibility</span>

   This API function checks whether a payment (both debit and credit)
   can go ahead.  It can be used, for example, to check

   o  if there are sufficient funds available in a particular currency
      for an electronic cash payment brand,
   o  whether there is sufficient value space left on the payment
      instrument for payment refund,
   o  whether required system resources are available and properly
      configured, e.g., serial ports or baud rate,
   o  whether environment requirements are fulfilled, e.g., chip card
      reader presence or Internet connection.

   If the payment method is based on external components, e.g., magnetic
   stripe or chip cards, and the check accesses the medium, the existing
   payment method should not mutually exclusive lock system resources,
   e.g., serial port or modem, that may also be required by other
   Existing Payment Software, e.g., multiple payment software components
   may share the same card reader.  If this happens for API internal
   request processing, the function has to unlock these components prior
   to return.  Otherwise, the payment may not proceed if the Consumer
   cancels immediately and decides to use another payment instrument.
   In this event the previous IOTP Payment Bridge is not notified about
   the change.

   This function call happens immediately after the Consumer's payment
   instrument selection.  For example, if the payment instrument is a
   chip card, that is not inserted in the chip card reader, the Consumer
   may be prompted for its insertion.  However, the Consumer should be
   able to hit some 'skip' button, if the payment check is part of the
   actual payment protocol, too.  Finally, the IOTP Payment Bridge may
   provide only a subset of these capabilities or may even directly
   generate a successful response without any checks.

   Input Parameters

   o  Brand Identifier - user selection
   o  Payment Instrument Identifier - user selection

   These Payment API calls may be made either by the Consumer's or
   Payment Handler's IOTP Application Core.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.1.%20%20Start%20Payment%20Consumer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.1" name="section-4.3.1">4.3.1</a>.  Start Payment Consumer</span>

   This API function initiates the actual payment transaction at the
   Consumer side.  The IOTP Payment Bridge and the Existing Payment
   Software perform all necessary initialization and preparation for
   payment transaction processing.  This includes the reservation of
   external periphery.  E.g., 1) the Consumer's chip card reader needs
   to be protected against access from other software components, 2) the
   insertion of the chip card may be requested, 3) the Internet
   connection may be re-established, or 4) the Payment Handler may open
   a mutual exclusive session to the security hardware.

   The IOTP Payment Bridge monitors the payment progress and stores the
   current payment states such that resumption - even after power
   failures - remains possible.  Note that the IOTP Application Core
   supplies only a subset of the following input parameter to the
   associated resumption API function and refers to the payment
   transaction through the party's payment identifier.

   Input Parameters

   o  Brand Identifier - copied from the selected Brand Element
   o  Payment Instrument Identifier - the user selection
   o  Currency Code and Currency - copied from the selected Currency

   This API function resumes a previously suspended payment at the
   Consumer side.  Resumption includes the internal inquiry of the
   payment transaction data, e.g., payment amount, protocol identifier,
   and the whole initialization as it has been applied on the "Start
   Payment Consumer" API request.

   It is up to the IOTP Application Core to decide whether an IOTP
   Payment Request Block or a IOTP Payment Exchange Block needs to be
   generated.  One indicator might be the receipt of a previous IOTP
   Payment Exchange Block from the Payment Handler, e.g., the knowledge
   of the Payment Handler Payment Identifier.

   Input Parameters

   o  Consumer Payment Identifier
   o  Wallet Identifier and/or Pass Phrase

   Bridge might reject the resumption request by using the "AttNotSupp"
   Error Code "naming" the Consumer Payment Identifier attribute.  Then
   the Consumer has to apply normal error processing to the current
   (sub-)transaction and to issue a new Payment Request Block to the
   Payment Handler.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.6.%20%20Change%20Process%20State"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.6" name="section-4.3.6">4.3.6</a>.  Change Process State</span>

   The IOTP Application Core changes the current payment status by this
   request.  The IOTP Payment Bridge may be notified about business
   level normal termination, cancellation, suspension, and processing
   errors.  Notification happens by requesting the intended process
   state.

   The IOTP Payment Bridge processes the status change and reports the
   result.

   The IOTP Application Core has to analyze any returned process status
   in order to check whether the IOTP Payment Bridge has agreed to or
   declined the status switch.  E.g., the submitted Process State
   "CompleteOk" may lead to the Payment Status "Failed" if the payment
   transaction has already failed.

   Transaction Suspension is notified by the newly introduced Process
   State "Suspended".  The other attribute values have been taken from
   the IOTP specification.

   This API function might be called by the Consumer, Merchant, or
   Payment Handler for each payment transaction anytime after the
   issuance of "FindPaymentInstrument" to the IOTP Payment Bridge by the
   Consumer, the issuance of "FindAcceptedPaymentBrand" by the Merchant,
   or the issuance of "StartPaymentPaymentHandler" by the Payment
   Handler.

   The Process States "CompletedOk", "Failed", and "ProcessError" are
   final in the sense that they can not be changed on subsequent calls.
   However, the API function should not return with an error code if
   such an incompatible call has been issued.  Instead it should report
   the old unchanged Process State.

   Unknown payment transactions are reported by the Error Code
   "AttValInvalid" pointing to the PayId attribute.

   Input Parameters

   o  Party's Payment Identifier
   o  intended Payment Status
   o  intended Completion Code
   o  Process (Transaction) Type which distinguishes between Payments
      and Inquiries.
   o  Wallet Identifier and/or Pass Phrase

   This API function reports the party's payment identifiers of any
   pending payment transactions that the IOTP Payment Bridge/Existing
   Payment Software recommends be completed or suspended prior to the
   processing of new payment transactions.  It does not respond with
   further transaction details.  These have to be requested with
   "Inquire Process State".

   Note that the IOTP Payment Bridge has to respond without the benefit
   of any pass phrase if there exist no pending payment transaction.
   But if there are some pending payment transactions, the IOTP Payment
   Bridge may refuse the immediate response and may instead request the
   appropriate pass phase from the IOTP Application Core.

   Input Parameters

   o  Wallet Identifier and/or Passphrase

   This function is used by the Consumer and might be used by the
   Payment Handler to check the consistency, validity, and integrity of
   IOTP payment receipts which might consist of Packaged Content
   Elements

   o  from the IOTP Payment Receipt Component - provided by the Payment
      Handler's "Inquire Process State" API call shortly before payment
      completion,

   o  from Payment Scheme Components being exchanged during the actual
      payment, or

   o  being returned by the Consumer's "Inquire Process State" API call
      shortly before payment completion

   The IOTP Application Core has to check the PayReceiptNameRefs
   attribute of the IOTP Payment Receipt Component and to supply exactly
   the Packaged Content Elements being referred to.

   Failed verification is returns a business error.

   This API function responds with any additional payment scheme
   specific data that is needed by the Payment Handler for Consumer
   initiated payment transaction inquiry processing.  Probably, the IOTP
   Payment Bridge (or the corresponding Existing Payment Software) has

   The Payment Handler calls this API function for Consumer initiated
   inquiry processing.  It differs from the previous "Inquire Process
   State" API function by the optional inclusion of payment scheme
   specific data.  The response may encapsulate further details about
   the payment transaction.

   Input Parameters

   o  Payment Handler Payment Identifier
   o  Wallet Identifier and/or Pass Phrase
   o  (Payment Scheme) Packaged Content - copied from the Inquiry
      Request Block's Payment Scheme Component

   The following API function notifies the IOTP Payment Bridge about the
   intended registration, modification, or deletion of a payment
   instrument.  The actual processing is up to the IOTP Payment Bridge.

   This API request may also be used to activate the IOTP Payment Bridge
   (and the corresponding Existing Payment Software) for general
   administration purposes.

   Input Parameters

   o  Brand Identifier
   o  Protocol Identifier
   o  Any action code:
   o  New - add new payment method / instrument
   o  Update - change the payment method's / instrument's data
   o  Delete - delete a payment method / instrument
   o  Wallet Identifier and/or Pass Phrase
   o  (Brand) Packaged Content - further payment brand description
   o  (Pay Protocol) Packaged Content - further payment protocol
      description

   o  (Protocol Amount) Packaged Content - further payment protocol
      description

   If the Action attribute is set, the Brand and Protocol Identifier
   have to also be set.  The IOTP Payment Bridge has to provide the
   required user dialogs and selection mechanisms.  E.g., updates and
   deletions may require the selection of the payment instrument.  A new
   wallet might be silently generated on the supplement of a new Wallet
   Identifier or after an additional end user acknowledge.  The IOTP
   Application Core should not provide any pass phrases for new wallets.
   Instead, the IOTP Payment Bridge has to request and verify them,
   which may return their value to the IOTP Application Core in plain
   text.  In addition, the IOTP Payment Bridge returns the supported
   authentication algorithms when a new brand and protocol pair has been
   registered.

   If the "Action" attribute is omitted, the IOTP Payment Bridge which
   is responsible for the Existing Payment Software pops up in a general
   interactive mode.

   Output Parameters

   o  An action code:
   o  New - added new wallet
   o  Update - changed wallet's configuration
   o  Delete - removed a wallet
   o  Wallet Identifier and/or Pass Phrase

   The IOTP Payment Bridge does not return any information about the set
   of registered payment instruments because these data items are
   dynamically inferred during the brand selection process at the
   beginning of each IOTP transaction.  However, the IOTP Application
   Core has to be notified about new wallets and should be notified
   about updated and removed wallets (identifier).  Alternatively,

   removed wallets can be implicitly detected during the next brand
   selection phase.  Updated wallets do no affect the processing of the
   IOTP Application Core.  The IOTP Payment Bridge should only support
   the addition of at most one wallet because it is not able to report
   multiple additions at once back to the IOTP Application Core.

   This API function, called by the IOTP Payment Bridge, is used to
   provide information for Consumer or Payment Handler notification
   about the progress of the payment transaction.

   Its use is illustrated in the diagram below.

                       Figure 9.  Call Back Function

   Whenever this function is called, the content of the status
   description should be made available to the user.  For example on a
   status bar, a pop up window, etc.

   A reference to the Call Back function is passed as an input parameter
   to the "Start Payment X" and "Resume Payment X" API function.
   Afterwards, this function might be called whenever the status changes
   or progress needs to be reported.

   Basically, the call back function accepts all input arguments or
   rejects the whole request.  It may even accept malformed requests.

   Some payment schemes may support or require that the Consumer might
   be able to cancel the payment at any time.  The Call Back function
   can be used to facilitate this by returning the cancellation request
   on the next call (using the Business Error Code and Completion Code
   "ConsCancelled").

   Vice versa the Payment Handler's Application Core might use the
   similar mechanism to signal its IOTP Payment Bridges any exceptional
   need for a fast shutdown.  These IOTP Payment Bridges may initiate
   the appropriate steps for terminating/cancelling all pending payment
   transactions.

   Note that the "Change Process State" API function provides the second
   mechanism for such kind of notification.  Therefore, the IOTP Payment
   Bridge or Existing Payment Software may ignore the details of the
   "Call Back" response.

   The IOTP Payment APIs only supports security using pass phrase to
   access to payment Wallet.  These can be protected over TLS, which
   provides stronger security at the transport layer, but
   implementations are out the scope of this document.
