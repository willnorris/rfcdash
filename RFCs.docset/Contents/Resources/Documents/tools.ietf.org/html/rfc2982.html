Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing
   expressions of MIB objects.  The results of these expressions become
   MIB objects usable like any other MIB object, such as for the test
   condition for declaring an event.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20The%20SNMP%20Management%20Framework"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  The SNMP Management Framework</span>

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in <a href="rfc2571.html">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, <a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="rfc1155.html" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>RFC1155</a>], STD 16, <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="rfc1212.html" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>RFC1212</a>] and <a href="rfc1215.html">RFC</a>
        <a href="rfc1215.html">1215</a> [<a href="rfc1215.html" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>RFC1215</a>].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="rfc2578.html" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>RFC2578</a>], STD 58, <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="rfc2579.html" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>RFC2579</a>] and
        STD 58, <a href="rfc2580.html">RFC 2580</a> [<a href="rfc2580.html" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>RFC2580</a>].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="rfc1157.html" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>RFC1157</a>].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in <a href="rfc1901.html">RFC 1901</a>
        [<a href="rfc1901.html" title='"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"'>RFC1901</a>] and <a href="rfc1906.html">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="rfc1906.html" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1906</a>].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in <a href="rfc1906.html">RFC 1906</a>
        [<a href="rfc1906.html" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1906</a>], <a href="rfc2572.html">RFC 2572</a> [<a href="rfc2572.html" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2572</a>] and <a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="rfc2574.html" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC2574</a>].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="rfc1157.html" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>RFC1157</a>].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        <a href="rfc1905.html">RFC 1905</a> [<a href="rfc1905.html" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>RFC1905</a>].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in <a href="rfc2573.html">RFC 2573</a>
        [<a href="rfc2573.html" title='"SNMPv3 Applications"'>RFC2573</a>] and the view-based access control mechanism described

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in <a href="rfc2570.html">RFC 2570</a> [<a href="rfc2570.html" title='"Introduction to Version 3 of the Internet-standard Network Management Framework"'>RFC2570</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Overview</span>

   Users of MIBs often desire MIB objects that MIB designers have not
   provided.  Furthermore, such needs vary from one management
   philosophy to another.  Rather than fill more and more MIBs with
   standardized objects, the Expression MIB supports externally defined
   expressions of existing MIB objects.

   In the Expression MIB the results of an evaluated expression are MIB
   objects that may be used like any other MIB objects.  These custom-
   defined objects are thus usable anywhere any other MIB object can be
   used.  For example, they can be used by a management application
   directly or referenced from another MIB, such as the Event MIB
   [MIBEventMIB].  They can even be used by the Expression MIB itself,
   forming expressions of expressions.

   The Expression MIB is instrumentation for a relatively powerful,
   complex, high-level application, considerably different from simple
   instrumentation for a communication driver or a protocol.  The MIB is
   appropriate in a relatively powerful, resource-rich managed system
   and not necessarily in a severely limited environment.

   Nevertheless, due to dependencies from the Event MIB [<a href="rfc2981.html" title='"Event MIB"'>RFC2981</a>] and
   the need to support as low-end a system as possible, the Expression
   MIB can be somewhat stripped down for lower-power, lower-resource
   implementations, as described in the Subsets section, below.

   Implementation of the Expression MIB in a managed system led to the
   addition of objects that may not have been necessary in an
   application environment with complete knowledge of compiled MIB
   definitions.  This is appropriate since implementation must be
   possible within typical managed systems with some constraints on
   system resources.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Usage"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Usage</span>

   On managed systems that can afford the overhead, the Expression MIB
   is a way to create new, customized MIB objects for monitoring.
   Although these can save some network traffic and overhead on
   management systems, that is often not a good tradeoff for objects
   that are simply to be recorded or displayed.

   An example of a use of the Expression MIB would be to provide custom
   objects for the Event MIB [<a href="rfc2981.html" title='"Event MIB"'>RFC2981</a>].  A complex expression can
   evaluate to a rate of flow or a boolean and thus be subject to
   testing as an event trigger, resulting in an SNMP notification.
   Without these capabilities such monitoring would be limited to the
   objects in predefined MIBs.  The Expression MIB thus supports
   powerful tools for the network manager faced with the monitoring of
   large, complex systems that can support a significant level of self
   management.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Persistence"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Persistence</span>

   Although like most MIBs this one has no explicit controls for the
   persistence of the values set in configuring an expression, a robust,
   polite implementation would certainly not force its managing
   applications to reconfigure it whenever it resets.

   Again, as with most MIBs, it is implementation specific how a system
   provides and manages such persistence.  To speculate, one could
   imagine, for example, that persistence depended on the context in
   which the expression was configured, or perhaps system-specific
   characteristics of the expression's owner.  Or perhaps everything in
   a MIB such as this one, which is clearly aimed at persistent
   configuration, is automatically part of a system's other persistent
   configuration.

   Most of the operation of the MIB is described or implied in the
   object definitions but a few highlights bear mentioning here.

   The MIB supports three types of object sampling for the MIB objects
   that make up the expression:  absolute, delta, and changed.

   Absolute samples are simply the value of the MIB object at the time
   it is sampled.

   Absolute samples are not sufficient for expressions of counters, as
   counters have meaning only as a delta (difference) from one sample to
   the next.  Thus objects may be sampled as deltas.  Delta sampling
   requires the application to maintain state for the value at the last
   sample, and to do continuous sampling whether or not anyone is
   looking at the results.  It thus creates constant overhead.

   Changed sampling is a simple fallout of delta sampling where rather
   than a difference the result is a boolean indicating whether or not
   the object changed value since the last sample.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.2.%20%20Wildcards"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.2" name="section-2.3.2">2.3.2</a>.  Wildcards</span>

   Wildcards allow the application of a single expression to multiple
   instances of the same MIB object.  The definer of the expression
   indicates this choice and provides a partial object identifier, with
   some or all of the instance portion left off.  The application then
   does the equivalent of GetNext to obtain the object values, thus
   discovering the instances.

   All wildcarded objects in an expression must have the same semantics
   for the missing portion of their object identifiers.  Otherwise, any
   successful evaluation of the wildcarded expression would be the
   result of the accidental matching of the wildcarded portion of the
   object identifiers in the expression.  Such an evaluation will likely
   produce results which are not meaningful.

   The expression can be evaluated only for those instances where all
   the objects in the expression are available with the same value for
   the wildcarded portion of the instance.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.3.%20%20Evaluation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.3" name="section-2.3.3">2.3.3</a>.  Evaluation</span>

   There are two important aspects of evaluation that may not be
   obvious:  what objects and when.

   What objects get used in the evaluation depends on the type of
   request and whether or not the expression contains wildcarded
   objects.  If the request was a Get, that locks down the instances to




<span class="grey">Kavasseri &amp; Stewart         Standards Track                     [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-6" id="page-6" name="page-6"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2982.html">RFC 2982</a>         Distributed Management Expression MIB      October 2000</span>


   be used.  If the request was a GetNext or GetBulk, the application
   must work its way up to the next full set of objects for the
   expression.

   Evaluation of expressions happens at two possible times, depending on
   the sampling method (delta or absolute) used to evaluate the
   expression.

   If there are no delta or change values in an expression, the
   evaluation occurs on demand, i.e. when a requester attempts to read
   the value of the expression.  In this case all requesters get a
   freshly calculated value.

   For expressions with delta or change values, evaluation goes on
   continuously, every sample period.  In this case requesters get the
   value as of the last sample period.  For any given sample period of a
   given expression, only those instances exist that provided a full set
   of object values.  It may be possible that a delta expression which
   was evaluated successfully for one sample period may not be
   successfully evaluated in the next sample period.  This may, for
   example, be due to missing instances for some or all of the objects
   in the expression.  In such cases, the value from the previous sample
   period (with the successful evaluation) must not be carried forward
   to the next sample period (with the failed evaluation).

   Values resulting from expression evaluation are identified with a
   combination of the object identifier (OID) for the data type from
   expValueTable (such as expValueCounter32Val), the expression owner,
   the expression name, and an OID fragment.

   The OID fragment is not an entire OID beginning with iso.dod.org
   (1.3.6).  Rather it begins with 0.0.  The remainder is either another
   0 when there is no wildcarding or the instance that satisfied the
   wildcard if there is wildcarding.

   To pare down the Expression MIBs complexity and use of resources an
   implementor can leave out various parts.

   Leaving out wildcarding significantly reduces the complexity of
   retrieving values to evaluate expressions and the processing required
   to do so.  Such an implementation would allow expressions made up of

   individual MIB objects but would not be suitable for expressions
   applied across large tables as each instance in the table would
   require a separate expression definition.

   Furthermore it would not be suitable for tables with arbitrary,
   dynamic instances, as expressions definitions could not predict what
   instance values to use.

   An implementation without wildcards might be useful for a self-
   managing system with small tables or few dynamic instances, or one
   that can do calculations only for a few key objects.

   Leaving out delta processing significantly reduces state that must be
   kept and the burden of ongoing processing even when no one is looking
   at the results.  Unfortunately it also makes expressions on counters
   unusable, as counters have meaning only as deltas.

   An implementation without deltas might be useful for a severely
   limited, self-managing system that has no need for expressions or
   events on counters.  Although conceivable, such systems would be
   rare.

   The MIB has the following sections:

       o   Resource -- management of the MIB's use of system resources.

       o   Definition -- definition of expressions.

       o   Value -- values of evaluated expressions.

   The resource section has objects to manage resource usage by
   wildcarded delta expressions, a potential major consumer of CPU and
   memory.

   The definition section contains the tables that define expressions.

   The expression table, indexed by expression owner and expression
   name, contains those parameters that apply to the entire expression,
   such as the expression itself, the data type of the result, and the
   sampling interval if it contains delta or change values.

   The object table, indexed by expression owner, expression name and
   object index within each expression, contains the parameters that
   apply to the individual objects that go into the expression,
   including the object identifier, sample type, discontinuity
   indicator, and such.

   The value section contains the values of evaluated expressions.

   The value table, indexed by expression owner, expression name and
   instance fragment contains a "discriminated union" of evaluated
   expression results.  For a given expression only one of the columns
   is instantiated, depending on the result data type for the
   expression.  The instance fragment is a constant or the final section
   of the object identifier that filled in a wildcard.

   The examples refer to tables and objects defined below in the MIB

   definitions.

   An expression may use wildcarded MIB objects that result in multiple
   values for the expression.  To specify a wildcarded MIB object a
   management application leaves off part or all of the instance portion
   of the object identifier, and sets expObjectWildcard to true(1) for
   that object.  For our example we'll use a counter of total blessings
   from a table of people.  Another table, indexed by town and person
   has blessings just from that town.

   So the index clauses are:

       personEntry OBJECT-TYPE
       ...
       INDEX { personIndex }

   And:

       townPersonEntry OBJECT-TYPE
       ...
       INDEX { townIndex, personIndex }

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2982.html">RFC 2982</a>         Distributed Management Expression MIB      October 2000</span>


   In our friendly application we may have entered our expression as:

       100 * townPersonBlessings.976.* / personBlessings.*

   What goes in expExpression is:

       100*$1/$2

   For example purposes we'll use some slightly far-fetched OIDs.  The
   People MIB is 1.3.6.1.99.7 and the Town MIB is 1.3.6.1.99.11, so for
   our two counters the OIDs are:

       personBlessings      1.3.6.1.99.7.1.3.1.4
       townPersonBlessings       1.3.6.1.99.11.1.2.1.9

   The rule for wildcards is that all the wildcarded parts have to match
   exactly.  In this case that means we have to hardwire the town and
   only the personIndex can be wildcarded.  So our values for
   expObjectID are:

       1.3.6.1.99.7.1.3.1.4
       1.3.6.1.99.11.1.2.1.9.976

   We're hardwired to townIndex 976 and personIndex is allowed to vary.

   The value of expExpressionPrefix can be either of those two counter
   OIDs (including the instance fragment in the second case), since
   either of them takes you to a MIB definition where you can look at
   the INDEX clause and figure out what's been left off.  What's been
   left off doesn't have to work out to be the same object, but it does
   have to work out to be the same values (semantics) for the result to
   make sense.  Note that the managed system can not typically check
   such semantics and if given nonsense will return nonsense.

   If we have people numbered 6, 19, and 42 in town number 976, the
   successive values of expValueInstance will be:

       0.0.6
       0.0.19
       0.0.42

   So there will be three values in expValueTable, with those OIDs as
   the expValueInstance part of their indexing.

   The following formula for line utilization of a half-duplex link is
   adapted from [<a href="#ref-PracPersp" title='"Network Management: A Practical Perspective"'>PracPersp</a>].

    utilization = (ifInOctets + ifOutOctets) * 800 / seconds / ifSpeed

   The expression results in the percentage line utilization per second.
   The total octets are multiplied by 8 to get bits and 100 to scale up
   the percentage as an integer.

   The following Expression MIB object values implement this as an
   expression for all ifIndexes that directly represent actual hardware.
   Since the octet counters are Counter32 values, they must be delta
   sampled to be meaningful.  The sample period is 6 seconds but for
   accuracy and independence is calculated as a delta of sysUpTime.

   The expObjectTable entry for ifInOctets has an expObjectConditional
   that checks for being a hardware interface.  Only one object in the
   expression needs that check associated, since it applies to the whole
   expression.  Since ifConnectorPresent is a TruthValue with values of
   1 or 2 rather than 0 and non-zero, it must also be in an expression
   rather than used directly for the conditional.

   The interface-specific discontinuity indicator is supplied only for
   ifInOctets since invalidating that sample will invalidate an attempt
   at evaluation, effectively invalidating ifOutOctets as well
   (correctly, because it has the same indicator).

   For notational clarity, in the rest of this document, a string in
   quotes as part of the object instance indicates the value that would
   actually be one subidentifier per byte.  The objects all belong to
   owner "me".

   Also for clarity OIDs are expressed as the object descriptor and
   instance.  In fact they must be supplied numerically, with all
   subidentifiers in place before the part for the particular object and
   instance.

    DESCRIPTION
     "The minimum expExpressionDeltaInterval this system will
     accept.  A system may use the larger values of this minimum to
     lessen the impact of constantly computing deltas.  For larger
     delta sampling intervals the system samples less often and
     suffers less overhead.  This object provides a way to enforce
     such lower overhead for all expressions created after it is
     set.

     The value -1 indicates that expResourceDeltaMinimum is
     irrelevant as the system will not accept 'deltaValue' as a
     value for expObjectSampleType.

     Unless explicitly resource limited, a system's value for
     this object should be 1, allowing as small as a 1 second
     interval for ongoing delta sampling.

     Changing this value will not invalidate an existing setting
     of expObjectSampleType."

     sample, i.e. to maintain state.

     This object limits maximum number of dynamic instance entries
     this system will support for wildcarded delta objects in
     expressions. For a given delta expression, the number of
     dynamic instances is the number of values that meet all criteria
     to exist times the number of delta values in the expression.

     A value of 0 indicates no preset limit, that is, the limit
     is dynamic based on system operation and resources.

     Unless explicitly resource limited, a system's value for
     this object should be 0.

     wildcard instance objects but will prevent the creation of more

    MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
     "Information about a single expression.  New expressions
     can be created using expExpressionRowStatus.

     To create an expression first create the named entry in this
     table.  Then use expExpressionName to populate expObjectTable.
     For expression evaluation to succeed all related entries in
     expExpressionTable and expObjectTable must be 'active'.  If
     these conditions are not met the corresponding values in
     expValue simply are not instantiated.

     Deleting an entry deletes all related entries in expObjectTable
     and expErrorTable.

     Because of the relationships among the multiple tables for an
     expression (expExpressionTable, expObjectTable, and
     expValueTable) and the SNMP rules for independence in setting
     object values, it is necessary to do final error checking when
     an expression is evaluated, that is, when one of its instances
     in expValueTable is read or a delta interval expires.  Earlier
     checking need not be done and an implementation may not impose
     any ordering on the creation of objects related to an
     expression.

     To maintain security of MIB information, when creating a new row in
     this table, the managed system must record the security credentials
     of the requester.  These security credentials are the parameters
     necessary as inputs to isAccessAllowed from the Architecture for

     Describing SNMP Management Frameworks.  When obtaining the objects
     that make up the expression, the system must (conceptually) use
     isAccessAllowed to ensure that it does not violate security.

     The evaluation of the expression takes place under the
     security credentials of the creator of its expExpressionEntry.

     Values of read-write objects in this table may be changed

     integer that corresponds to an expObjectIndex.  An
     example of a valid expression is:

          ($1-$5)*100

     Expressions must not be recursive, that is although an expression
     may use the results of another expression, it must not contain
     any variable that is directly or indirectly a result of its own
     evaluation. The managed system must check for recursive
     expressions.

     The only allowed operators are:

          ( )
          - (unary)
          + - * / %
          &amp; | ^ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; ~
          ! &amp;&amp; || == != &gt; &gt;= &lt; &lt;=

     Note the parentheses are included for parenthesizing the
     expression, not for casting data types.

     The only constant types defined are:

          int (32-bit signed)
          long (64-bit signed)
          unsigned int
          unsigned long
          hexadecimal
          character
          string
          oid

     The default type for a positive integer is int unless it is too
     large in which case it is long.

     All but oid are as defined for ANSI C.  Note that a
     hexadecimal constant may end up as a scalar or an array of
     8-bit integers.  A string constant is enclosed in double
     quotes and may contain back-slashed individual characters
     as in ANSI C.

     An oid constant comprises 32-bit, unsigned integers and at
     least one period, for example:

          0.
          .0
          1.3.6.1

     No additional leading or trailing subidentifiers are automatically
     added to an OID constant.  The constant is taken as expressed.

     Integer-typed objects are treated as 32- or 64-bit, signed
     or unsigned integers, as appropriate.  The results of
     mixing them are as for ANSI C, including the type of the
     result.  Note that a 32-bit value is thus promoted to 64 bits
     only in an operation with a 64-bit value.  There is no
     provision for larger values to handle overflow.

     Relative to SNMP data types, a resulting value becomes
     unsigned when calculating it uses any unsigned value,
     including a counter.  To force the final value to be of
     data type counter the expression must explicitly use the
     counter32() or counter64() function (defined below).

     OCTET STRINGS and OBJECT IDENTIFIERs are treated as
     one-dimensioned arrays of unsigned 8-bit integers and
     unsigned 32-bit integers, respectively.

     IpAddresses are treated as 32-bit, unsigned integers in
     network byte order, that is, the hex version of 255.0.0.0 is
     0xff000000.

     Conditional expressions result in a 32-bit, unsigned integer
     of value 0 for false or 1 for true. When an arbitrary value
     is used as a boolean 0 is false and non-zero is true.

     Rules for the resulting data type from an operation, based on
     the operator:

     For &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; the result is the same as the left hand operand.

     For &amp;&amp;, ||, ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and &gt;= the result is always
     Unsigned32.

     For unary - the result is always Integer32.

     For +, -, *, /, %, &amp;, |, and ^ the result is promoted according
     to the following rules, in order from most to least preferred:

          If left hand and right hand operands are the same type,
          use that.

          If either side is Counter64, use that.

          If either side is IpAddress, use that.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2982.html">RFC 2982</a>         Distributed Management Expression MIB      October 2000</span>


          If either side is TimeTicks, use that.

          If either side is Counter32, use that.

          Otherwise use Unsigned32.

     The following rules say what operators apply with what data
     types.  Any combination not explicitly defined does not work.

     For all operators any of the following can be the left hand or
     right hand operand: Integer32, Counter32, Unsigned32, Counter64.

     The operators +, -, *, /, %, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and &gt;= work with
     TimeTicks.

     The operators &amp;, |, and ^ work with IpAddress.

     The operators &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; work with IpAddress but only as the
     left hand operand.

     The + operator performs a concatenation of two OCTET STRINGs or
     two OBJECT IDENTIFIERs.

     The operators &amp;, | perform bitwise operations on OCTET STRINGs.
     If the OCTET STRING happens to be a DisplayString the results
     may be meaningless, but the agent system does not check this as
     some such systems do not have this information.

     The operators &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; perform bitwise operations on OCTET
     STRINGs appearing as the left hand operand.

     The only functions defined are:

          counter32
          counter64
          arraySection
          stringBegins

     The following function definitions indicate their parameters by
     naming the data type of the parameter in the parameter's position
     in the parameter list.  The parameter must be of the type indicated
     and generally may be a constant, a MIB object, a function, or an
     expression.

     counter32(integer) - wrapped around an integer value counter32
     forces Counter32 as a data type.

     counter64(integer) - similar to counter32 except that the
     resulting data type is 'counter64'.

     arraySection(array, integer, integer) - selects a piece of an
     array (i.e. part of an OCTET STRING or OBJECT IDENTIFIER).  The
     integer arguments are in the range 0 to 4,294,967,295.  The
     first is an initial array index (one-dimensioned) and the second
     is an ending array index.  A value of 0 indicates first or last
     element, respectively.  If the first element is larger than the
     array length the result is 0 length.  If the second integer is
     less than or equal to the first, the result is 0 length.  If the
     second is larger than the array length it indicates last
     element.

     stringBegins/Ends/Contains(octetString, octetString) - looks for
     the second string (which can be a string constant) in the first
     and returns the one-dimensioned arrayindex where the match began.
     A return value of 0 indicates no match (i.e. boolean false).

     oidBegins/Ends/Contains(oid, oid) - looks for the second OID
     (which can be an OID constant) in the first and returns the
     the one-dimensioned index where the match began. A return value
     of 0 indicates no match (i.e. boolean false).

     average/maximum/minimum(integer) - calculates the average,
     minimum, or maximum value of the integer valued object over
     multiple sample times.  If the object disappears for any
     sample period, the accumulation and the resulting value object
     cease to exist until the object reappears at which point the
     calculation starts over.

     sum(integerObject*) - sums all available values of the
     wildcarded integer object, resulting in an integer scalar.  Must
     be used with caution as it wraps on overflow with no
     notification.

     exists(anyTypeObject) - verifies the object instance exists. A
     return value of 0 indicates NoSuchInstance (i.e. boolean
     false)."

     Note that delta values potentially consume large amounts of
     system CPU and memory.  Delta state and processing must
     continue constantly even if the expression is not being used.
     That is, the expression is being evaluated every delta interval,
     even if no application is reading those values.  For wildcarded
     objects this can be substantial overhead.

     Note that delta intervals, external expression value sampling
     intervals and delta intervals for expressions within other
     expressions can have unusual interactions as they are impossible
     to synchronize accurately.  In general one interval embedded
     below another must be enough shorter that the higher sample
     sees relatively smooth, predictable behavior.  So, for example,
     to avoid the higher level getting the same sample twice, the
     lower level should sample at least twice as fast as the higher

     Otherwise, the value of expExpressionPrefix is the expObjectID
     value of any one of the wildcarded objects for the expression.

     If there is no wildcarding, the value is 0.0.0.  In other
     words, there is one value which standing alone would have
     been a scalar with a 0 at the end of its OID.

     If there is wildcarding, the value is 0.0 followed by
     a value that the wildcard can take, thus defining one value
     instance for each real, possible value of the wildcard.
     So, for example, if the wildcard worked out to be an ifIndex,
     there is an expValueInstance for each applicable ifIndex."

   Expression MIB security involves two perspectives:  protection of
   expressions from tampering or unauthorized use of resources, and
   protection of the objects used to calculate the expressions.



<span class="grey">Kavasseri &amp; Stewart         Standards Track                    [Page 38]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-39" id="page-39" name="page-39"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2982.html">RFC 2982</a>         Distributed Management Expression MIB      October 2000</span>


   Security of expression definitions and results depends on the
   expression owner (expExpressionOwner).  With view-based access
   control [<a href="rfc2575.html" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2575</a>] a network manager can control who has what level of
   access to what expressions.

   Access control for the objects within the expression depends on the
   security credentials of the expression creator.  These are the
   security credentials used to get the objects necessary to evaluate
   the expression.  They are the security credentials that were used to
   set the expExpressionRowStatus object for that expression to
   'active', as recorded by the managed system.

   This means that the results of an expression could potentially be
   made available to someone who does not have access to the raw data
   that went into them.  This could be either legitimate or a security
   violation, depending on the specific situation and security policy.

   To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security
   administrator for this MIB itself using the View-Based Access Control
   Model (VACM) defined in <a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="rfc2575.html" title='"View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2575</a>] for tables in which
   multiple users may need to independently create or modify entries,
   the initial index is used as an "owner index".  Such an initial index
   has a syntax of SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to
   a securityName or groupName as defined in VACM, in accordance with a
   security policy.

   All entries in related tables belonging to a particular user will
   have the same value for this initial index.  For a given user's
   entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the
   information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers
   (except for the "column" subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded
   owner index.  To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of
   the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the
   value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion,
   and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask "wildcarding" the column subidentifier.
   More elaborate configurations are possible.
