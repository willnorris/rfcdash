   This document specifies a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>1</a>]
   Option for the coordinate-based geographic location of the client, to
   be provided by the server.

   The DHCP server is assumed to have determined the location from the
   Circuit-ID Relay Agent Information Option (RAIO) defined (as SubOpt
   1) in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"DHCP Relay Agent Information Option"'>2</a>].  In order to translate the circuit (switch port
   identifier) into a location, the DHCP server is assumed to have
   access to a service that maps from circuit-ID to the location at
   which the circuit connected to that port terminates in the building,
   for example, the location of the wall jack.

   An important feature of this specification is that after the relevant
   DHC exchanges have taken place, the location information is stored on
   the end device rather than somewhere else, where retrieving it might
   be difficult in practice.

   Another important feature of this LCI is its inclusion of a
   resolution parameter for each of the dimensions of location.  Because
   this resolution parameter need not apply to all dimensions equally, a
   resolution value is included for each of the 3 location elements.

   Resolution does not define Geographic Privacy policy.

   The resulting location information using this resolution method is a
   small fixed length Configuration Information that can be easily
   carried in protocols, such as DHCP, which have limited packet size
   because this LCI is only 18 bytes long.

   Finally, the appendix of this document provides some arithmetic
   examples of the implication of different resolution values on the
   La/Lo/Alt.

   As applications such as IP Telephony are replacing conventional
   telephony, users are expecting the same (or greater) level of
   services with the new technology.  One service offered by
   conventional telephony that is missing in any standardized fashion
   within IP Telephony is for a user to be automatically located by
   emergency responders, in a timely fashion, when the user summons help
   (by dialing 911 in North America, for example).  Unless strict
   administrative rules are followed, the mobility of a wired Ethernet
   device within a campus negates any opportunity for an emergency
   responder to locate the device with any degree of expediency.  Users
   do not want to give up the mobility IP Telephony offers.  Informing
   the host device of its geo-location at host configuration time will
   allow the device to utilize this geo-location information to inform
   others of its current geo-location, if the user and/or application so
   desires.

   The goal of this option is to enable a wired Ethernet host to obtain
   its location, which it could provide to an emergency responder, as
   one example.

   Wireless hosts can utilize this option to gain knowledge of the
   location of the radio access point used during host configuration,
   but would need some more exotic mechanisms, maybe GPS, or maybe a
   future DHCP option, which includes a list of geo-locations like that
   defined here, containing the locations of the radio access points
   that are close to the client.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.%20%20Rationale"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Rationale</span>

   Within the LCI described here, Latitude and Longitude are represented
   in fixed-point 2s-complement binary degrees, for the economy of a
   smaller option size compared to a string encoding of digits in [<a href="#ref-7" title='"DNS Encoding of Geographical Location"'>7</a>].
   The integer parts of these fields are 9 bits long to accommodate +/-
   180 degrees.  The fractional part is 25 bits long, better than the
   precision of 7 decimal digits.  The length of each field is 40 bits,
   34 of which is the sum of the integer (9) and fractional (25) bits,
   plus 6 bits of resolution.

   Altitude is determined by the Altitude Type (AT) indicated by the AT
   field, which is 4 bits long.  Two Altitude Types are defined here,
   meters (code=1) and floors (code=2), both of which are 2s-complement
   fixed-point with 22 bits of integer part and 8 bits of fractional
   part.  Additional Altitude Types MAY be assigned by IANA.  The
   "floors" Altitude Type is provided because altitude in meters may not
   be known within a building, and a floor indication may be more
   useful.

   GPS systems today can use WGS84 for horizontal and vertical datums;
   [<a href="#ref-6" title="MIL-STD-2401">6</a>] defines WGS84 as a three-dimensional datum.  For other datum
   values that do not include a vertical component, both the horizontal
   and vertical datum of reference will be specified in the IANA record.

   Each of these 3 elements begins with an accuracy sub-field of 6 bits,

   field accommodates the desire to easily adjust the precision of a
   reported location.  Contents beyond the claimed resolution MAY be
   randomized to obscure greater precision that might be available.

   DHCP is a binary Protocol; using protocols of LCI are likely to be
   text based.  Since most coordinate systems translate easily between
   binary-based and text-based location output (even emergency services
   within the US), translation/conversion is a non-issue with DHCP's
   binary format.

   This binary format provides a fortunate benefit in a mechanism for
   making a true/correct location coordinate imprecise.  It further
   provides the capability to have this binary representation be
   deterministically imprecise.

   Code 123:  The code for this DHCP option.

   16:        The length of this option is 16 bytes.

   LaRes:     Latitude resolution.  6 bits indicating the number of
              valid bits in the fixed-point value of Latitude.

   This value is the number of high-order Latitude bits that should be
   considered valid.  Any bits entered to the right of this limit should
   not be considered valid and might be purposely false, or zeroed by
   the sender.

   The examples in the appendix illustrate that a smaller value in the
   resolution field increases the area within which the device is
   located.

   LaRes does not define Geographic Privacy policy.

              Values above decimal 34 are undefined and reserved.

   Latitude:  a 34 bit fixed point value consisting of 9 bits of integer
              and 25 bits of fraction.  Latitude SHOULD be normalized to
              within +/- 90 degrees.  Positive numbers are north of the
              equator and negative numbers are south of the equator.

   A value of 2 in the LaRes field indicates a precision of no greater
   than 1/6th that of the globe (in the first example of the appendix).
   A value of 34 in the LaRes field indicates a precision of about 3.11
   mm in Latitude at the equator.

   LoRes:     Longitude resolution.  6 bits indicating the number of
              valid bits in the fixed-point value of Longitude.

   This value is the number of high-order Longitude bits that should be
   considered valid.  Any bits entered to the right of this limit should
   not be considered valid and might be purposely false, or zeroed by
   the sender.

   LoRes does not define Geographic Privacy policy.

              Values above decimal 34 are undefined and reserved.

   Longitude: a 34 bit fixed point value consisting of 9 bits of integer
              and 25 bits of fraction.  Longitude SHOULD be normalized
              to within +/- 180 degrees.  Positive values are East of
              the prime meridian and negative (2s complement) numbers
              are West of the prime meridian.

   A value of 2 in the LoRes field indicates precision of no greater
   than 1/6th that of the globe (see first example of the appendix).  A
   value of 34 in the LoRes field indicates a precision of about 2.42 mm
   in longitude (at the equator).  Because lines of longitude converge
   at the poles, the distance is smaller (better precision) for
   locations away from the equator.

   Altitude:  A 30 bit value defined by the AT field

   AltRes:    Altitude resolution.  6 bits indicating the number of
              valid bits in the altitude.  Values above 30 (decimal) are
              undefined and reserved.

   AltRes does not define Geographic Privacy policy.

   AT:        Altitude Type for altitude.  Codes defined are:

   1: Meters - in 2s-complement fixed-point 22-bit integer part with 8-
              bit fraction

   If AT = 1, an AltRes value 0.0 would indicate unknown altitude.  The
   most precise Altitude would have an AltRes value of 30.  Many values
   of AltRes would obscure any variation due to vertical datum
   differences.

   2: Floors - in 2s-complement fixed-point 22-bit integer part with
              8-bit fraction

   AT = 2 for Floors enables representing altitude in a form more
   relevant in buildings which have different floor-to-floor dimensions.
   An altitude coded as AT = 2, AltRes = 30, and Altitude = 0.0 is
   meaningful even outside a building, and represents ground level at
   the given latitude and longitude.  Inside a building, 0.0 represents
   the floor level associated with ground level at the main entrance.
   This document defines a number; one must arrive at the number by
   counting floors from the floor defined to be 0.0.

   The values represented by this AT will be of local significance.
   Since buildings and floors can vary due to lack of common control,
   the values chosen to represent the characteristics of an individual
   building will be derived and agreed upon by the operator of the
   building and the intended users of the data.  Attempting to
   standardize this type of function is beyond the scope this document.

   Sub-floors can be represented by non-integer values.  Example: a
   mezzanine between floor 1 and floor 2 could be represented as a value
   = 1.1.  Example: (2) mezzanines between floor 4 and floor 5 could be
   represented as values = 4.1 and 4.2 respectively.

   Floors located below ground level could be represented by negative
   values.

   Larger values represent floors that are above (higher in altitude)
   floors with lower values.

   The AltRes field SHOULD be set to maximum precision when AT = 2
   (floors) when a floor value is included in the DHCP Reply, or the
   AT = 0 to denote the floor isn't known.

   Any additional LCI Altitude Types(s) to be defined for use via this
   DHC Option MUST be done through a Standards Track RFC.

   Datum: The Map Datum used for the coordinates given in this Option

   The datum must include both a horizontal and a vertical reference.
   Since the WGS 84 reference datum is three-dimensional, it includes
   both.  For any additional datum parameters, the datum codepoint must
   specify both horizontal datum and vertical datum references.

   The Datum byte has 256 possibilities, of which 3 have been registered
   with IANA by this document (all derived from specification in [<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]):

   Where critical decisions might be based on the value of this GeoConf
   option, DHCP authentication in [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Authentication for DHCP Messages"'>4</a>] SHOULD be used to protect the
   integrity of the DHCP options.

   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the DHCP server and
   requesting client can discover this LCI.

   To minimize the unintended exposure of location information, the LCI
   option SHOULD be returned by DHCP servers only when the DHCP client
   has included this option in its 'parameter request list' (<a href="#section-3.5">section 3.5</a>
   [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>1</a>]).

   When implementing a DHC server that will serve clients across an

   risks.

   The GeoConf Option defines two fields for which IANA maintains a
   registry: The Altitude (AT) field (see <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>) and the Datum field
   (see <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>).  The datum indicator MUST include specification of

Appendix: Calculations of Imprecision Possible with the DHC LCI

   The following examples for two different locations demonstrate how
   the Resolution values for Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude can be
   used.  In both examples the geo-location values were derived from
   maps using the WGS84 map datum, therefore in these examples, the
   datum field would have a value = 1 (00000001, or 0x01).

       south-southwest of Los Angeles, CA due north to the North Pole.
       This would cover an area of about one-sixth of the globe,
       approximately 20 million square nautical miles (nm).

   If: LaRes is expressed as value 3 (0x03 or 000011) and LoRes is
       expressed as value 3 (0x03 or 000011), then it would describe a

       north, and -65 degrees to -128 degrees longitude.  This area
       includes south of a line from Anchorage, AL to eastern Nunavut,
       CN, and from the Amazons of northern Brazil to approximately
       4400km south-southwest of Los Angeles, CA.  This area would

       38.8986816 and extends from -77.0372314 degrees to -77.0372296
       degrees longitude.  This is an area of approximately 339 square

       38.8986802 and extends from -77.0372300 degrees to -77.0372296
       degrees longitude.  This is an area of approximately 7.5 square
       millimeters (3.11mm x 2.42mm).

   In the (White House) example, the requirement of emergency responders
   in North America via their NENA Model Legislation [<a href="#ref-8">8</a>] could be met by
   a LaRes value of 21 and a LoRes value of 20.  This would yield a
   geo-location that is latitude 38.8984375 north to latitude 38.8988616
   north and longitude -77.0371094 to longitude -77.0375977.  This is an
   area of approximately 89 feet by 75 feet or 6669 square feet, which
   is very close to the 7000 square feet requested by NENA.  In this
   example, a service provider could enforce that a device send a
   Location Configuration Information with this minimum amount of

   Postal Address:
      Sears Tower
      103rd Floor
      233 S. Wacker Dr.
      Chicago, IL  60606

   Viewing the Chicago area from the Observation Deck of the Sears
   Tower.

   Latitude 41.87884 degrees North (or +41.87884 degrees)
   Using 2s complement, 34 bit fixed point, 25 bit fraction

   Longitude 87.63602 degrees West (or -87.63602 degrees)
   Using 2s complement, 34 bit fixed point, 25 bit fraction
   Longitude = 0xf50ba5b97,
   Longitude = 1101010000101110100101101110010111

   Altitude 103

   In this example, we are inside a structure, therefore we will assume
   an altitude value of 103 to indicate the floor we are on.  The
   Altitude Type value is 2, indicating floors.  The AltRes field would
   indicate that all bits in the Altitude field are true, as we want to
   accurately represent the floor of the structure where we are located.

   AltRes = 30, 0x1e, 011110
   AT = 2, 0x02, 000010
   Altitude = 103, 0x00006700, 000000000000000110011100000000

   For the accuracy of the latitude and longitude, the best information
   available to us was supplied by a generic mapping service that shows
   a single geo-loc for all of the Sears Tower.  Therefore we are going
   to show LaRes as value 18 (0x12 or 010010) and LoRes as value 18
   (0x12 or 010010).  This would be describing a geo-location area that
   is latitude 41.8769531 to latitude 41.8789062 and extends from
   -87.6367188 degrees to -87.6347657 degrees longitude.  This is an
   area of approximately 373412 square feet (713.3 ft. x 523.5 ft.).
