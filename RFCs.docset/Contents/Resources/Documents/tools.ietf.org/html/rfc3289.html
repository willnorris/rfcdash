      o  An overall architecture, described in [<a href="rfc2571.html">RFC 2571</a>].

      o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
         purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
         Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and is described
         in [<a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a>], [<a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a>] and [<a href="rfc1215.html">RFC 1215</a>].  The second version,
         called SMIv2, is described in [<a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a>], <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a> [<a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a>]
         and [<a href="rfc2580.html">RFC 2580</a>].

      o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
         is described in [<a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a>].  A second version of the SNMP
         message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
         protocol, is called SNMPv2c and is described in [<a href="rfc1901.html">RFC 1901</a>] and
         [<a href="rfc1906.html">RFC 1906</a>].  The third version of the message protocol is
         called SNMPv3 and is described in [<a href="rfc1906.html">RFC 1906</a>], [<a href="rfc2572.html">RFC 2572</a>] and
         [<a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a>].

      o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
         first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
         described in [<a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a>].  A second set of protocol operations
         and associated PDU formats is described in [<a href="rfc1905.html">RFC 1905</a>].

      o  A set of fundamental applications described in [<a href="rfc2573.html">RFC 2573</a>] and
         the view-based access control mechanism described in [RFC
         2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in [<a href="rfc2570.html">RFC 2570</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because there
   is no translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.

   The Differentiated Services Working Group and related working groups
   developed other documents, notably the Informal Management Model and
   the policy configuration paradigm of SNMPCONF.  The relationship
   between the MIB and those documents is clarified here.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Relationship%20to%20the%20Informal%20Management%20Model%20for%20Differentiated"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Relationship to the Informal Management Model for Differentiated</span>
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Services%20Router"></a>      Services Router</span>

   This MIB is similar in design to [<a href="#ref-MODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for Differentiated Services Routers"'>MODEL</a>], although it can be used to
   build functional data paths that the model would not well describe.
   The model conceptually describes ingress and egress interfaces of an
   n-port router, which may find some interfaces at a network edge and
   others facing into the network core.  It describes the configuration
   and management of a Differentiated Services interface in terms of one
   or more Traffic Conditioning Blocks (TCB), each containing, arranged
   in the specified order, by definition, zero or more classifiers,
   meters, actions, algorithmic droppers, queues and schedulers.
   Traffic may be classified, and classified traffic may be metered.
   Each stream of traffic identified by a combination of classifiers and
   meters may have some set of actions performed on it; it may have
   dropping algorithms applied and it may ultimately be stored into a
   queue before being scheduled out to its next destination, either onto
   a link or to another TCB.  At times, the treatment for a given packet
   must have any of those elements repeated.  [<a href="#ref-MODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for Differentiated Services Routers"'>MODEL</a>] models this by
   cascading multiple TCBs, while this MIB describes the policy by
   directly linking the functional data path elements.

   The MIB represents this cascade by following the "Next" attributes of
   the various elements.  They indicate what the next step in
   Differentiated Services processing will be, whether it be a
   classifier, meter, action, algorithmic dropper, queue, scheduler or a
   decision to now forward a packet.

   The higher level concept of a TCB is not required in the
   parameterization or in the linking together of the individual
   elements, hence it is not used in the MIB itself and is only
   mentioned in the text for relating the MIB with the [<a href="#ref-MODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for Differentiated Services Routers"'>MODEL</a>].  Rather,
   the MIB models the individual elements that make up the TCBs.

   This MIB uses the notion of a Data Path to indicate the
   Differentiated Services processing a packet may experience.  The Data
   Path a packet will initially follow is an attribute of the interface

   in question.  The Data Path Table provides a starting point for each
   direction (ingress or egress) on each interface.  A Data Path Table
   Entry indicates the first of possible multiple elements that will
   apply Differentiated Services treatment to the packet.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Relationship%20to%20other%20MIBs%20and%20Policy%20Management"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Relationship to other MIBs and Policy Management</span>

   This MIB provides for direct reporting and manipulation of detailed
   functional elements.  These elements consist of a structural element
   and one or more parameter-bearing elements.  While this can be
   cumbersome, it allows the reuse of parameters.  For example, a
   service provider may offer three varieties of contracts, and
   configure three parameter elements.  Each such data path on the
   system may then refer to these sets of parameters.  The
   diffServDataPathTable couples each direction on each interface with
   the specified data path linkage.  The concept of "interface" is as
   defined by InterfaceIndex/ifIndex of the IETF Interfaces MIB [IF-
   MIB].

   Other MIBs and data structure definitions for policy management
   mechanisms, other than SNMP/SMIv2 are likely to exist in the future
   for the purpose of abstracting the model in other ways.  An example
   is the Differentiated Services Policy Information Base, [<a href="#ref-DSPIB" title='"Differentiated Services Quality of Service Policy Information Base"'>DSPIB</a>].

   In particular, abstractions in the direction of less detailed
   definitions of Differentiated Services functionality are likely e.g.
   some form of "Per-Hop Behavior"-based definition involving a template
   of detailed object values which is applied to specific instances of
   objects in this MIB semi-automatically.

   Another possible direction of abstraction is one using a concept of
   "roles" (often, but not always, applied to interfaces).  In this
   case, it may be possible to re-use the object definitions in this
   MIB, especially the parameterization tables.  The Data Path table
   will help in the reuse of the data path linkage tables by having the
   interface specific information centralized, allowing easier
   mechanical replacement of ifIndex by some sort of "roleIndex".  This
   work is ongoing.

   The reuse of parameter blocks on a variety of functional data paths
   is intended to simplify network management.  In many cases, one could
   also re-use the structural elements as well; this has the unfortunate
   side-effect of re-using the counters, so that monitoring information
   is lost.  For this reason, the re-use of structural elements is not
   generally recommended.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3289.html">RFC 3289</a>              Differentiated Services MIB               May 2002</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20MIB%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  MIB Overview</span>

   The Differentiated Services Architecture does not specify how an
   implementation should be assembled.  The [<a href="#ref-MODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for Differentiated Services Routers"'>MODEL</a>] describes a general
   approach to implementation design, or to user interface design.  Its
   components could, however, be assembled in a different way.  For
   example, traffic conforming to a meter might be run through a second
   meter, or reclassified.

   This MIB models the same functional data path elements, allowing the
   network manager to assemble them in any fashion that meets the
   relevant policy.  These data path elements include Classifiers,
   Meters, Actions of various sorts, Queues, and Schedulers.

   In many of these tables, a distinction is drawn between the structure
   of the policy (do this, then do that) and the parameters applied to
   specific policy elements.  This is to facilitate configuration, if
   the MIB is used for that.  The concept is that a set of parameters,
   such as the values that describe a specific token bucket, might be
   configured once and applied to many interfaces.

   The RowPointer Textual Convention is therefore used in two ways in
   this MIB.  It is defined for the purpose of connecting an object to
   an entry dynamically; the RowPointer object identifies the first
   object in the target Entry, and in so doing points to the entire
   entry.  In this MIB, it is used as a connector between successive
   functional data path elements, and as the link between the policy
   structure and the parameters that are used.  When used as a
   connector, it says what happens "next"; what happens to classified
   traffic, to traffic conforming or not conforming to a meter, and so
   on.  When used to indicate the parameters applied in a policy, it
   says "specifically" what is meant; the structure points to the
   parameters of its policy.

   The use of RowPointers as connectors allows for the simple extension
   of the MIB.  The RowPointers, whether "next" or "specific", may point
   to Entries defined in other MIB modules.  For example, the only type
   of meter defined in this MIB is a token bucket meter; if another type
   of meter is required, another MIB could be defined describing that
   type of meter, and diffServMeterSpecific could point to it.
   Similarly, if a new action is required, the "next" pointer of the
   previous functional datapath element could point to an Entry defined
   in another MIB, public or proprietary.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Processing%20Path"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Processing Path</span>

   An interface has an ingress and an egress direction, and will
   generally have a different policy in each direction.  As traffic
   enters an edge interface, it may be classified, metered, counted, and
   marked.  Traffic leaving the same interface might be remarked
   according to the contract with the next network, queued to manage the
   bandwidth, and so on.  As [<a href="#ref-MODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for Differentiated Services Routers"'>MODEL</a>] points out, the functional datapath
   elements used on ingress and egress are of the same type, but may be
   structured in very different ways to implement the relevant policies.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.1.%20%20diffServDataPathTable%20-%20The%20Data%20Path%20Table"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" name="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  diffServDataPathTable - The Data Path Table</span>

   Therefore, when traffic arrives at an ingress or egress interface,
   the first step in applying the policy is determining what policy
   applies.  This MIB does that by providing a table of pointers to the
   first functional data path element, indexed by interface and
   direction on that interface.  The content of the
   diffServDataPathEntry is a single RowPointer, which points to that
   functional data path element.

   When diffServDataPathStart in a direction on an interface is
   undefined or is set to zeroDotZero, the implication is that there is
   no specific policy to apply.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Classifier"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Classifier</span>

   Classifiers are used to differentiate among types of traffic.  In the
   Differentiated Services architecture, one usually discusses a
   behavior aggregate identified by the application of one or more
   Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs).  However, especially at
   network edges (which include hosts and first hop routers serving
   hosts), traffic may arrive unmarked or the marks may not be trusted.
   In these cases, one applies a Multi-Field Classifier, which may
   select an aggregate as coarse as "all traffic", as fine as a specific
   microflow identified by IP Addresses, IP Protocol, and TCP or UDP
   ports, or variety of slices in between.

   Classifiers can be simple or complex.  In a core interface, one would
   expect to find simple behavior aggregate classification to be used.
   However, in an edge interface, one might first ask what application
   is being used, meter the arriving traffic, and then apply various
   policies to the non-conforming traffic depending on the Autonomous
   System number advertising the destination address.  To accomplish
   such a thing, traffic must be classified, metered, and then
   reclassified.  To this end, the MIB defines separate classifiers,
   which may be applied at any point in processing, and may have
   different content as needed.



<span class="grey">Baker, et. al.              Standards Track                     [Page 7]</span></pre>

   The MIB also allows for ambiguous classification in a structured
   fashion.  In the end, traffic classification must be unambiguous; one
   must know for certain what policy to apply to any given packet.
   However, writing an unambiguous specification is often tedious, while
   writing a specification in steps that permits and excludes various
   kinds of traffic may be simpler and more intuitive.  In such a case,
   the classification "steps" are enumerated; all classification
   elements of one precedence are applied as if in parallel, and then
   all classification elements of the next precedence.

   This MIB defines a single classifier parameter entry, the Multi-field
   Classifier.  A degenerate case of this multi-field classifier is a
   Behavior Aggregate classifier.  Other classifiers may be defined in
   other MIB modules, to select traffic from a given layer two neighbor
   or a given interface, traffic whose addresses belong to a given BGP
   Community or Autonomous System, and so on.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.1.%20%20diffServClfrElementTable%20-%20The%20Classifier%20Element%20Table"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.1" name="section-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>.  diffServClfrElementTable - The Classifier Element Table</span>

   A classifier consists of classifier elements.  A classifier element
   identifies a specific set of traffic that forms part of a behavior
   aggregate; other classifier elements within the same classifier may
   identify other traffic that also falls into the behavior aggregate.
   For example, in identifying AF traffic for the aggregate AF1, one
   might implement separate classifier elements for AF11, AF12, and AF13
   within the same classifier and pointing to the same subsequent meter.

   Generally, one would expect the Data Path Entry to point to a
   classifier (which is to say, a set of one or more classifier
   elements), although it may point to something else when appropriate.
   Reclassification in a functional data path is achieved by pointing to
   another Classifier Entry when appropriate.

   A classifier element is a structural element, indexed by classifier
   ID and element ID.  It has a precedence value, allowing for
   structured ambiguity as described above, a "specific" pointer that
   identifies what rule is to be applied, and a "next" pointer directing
   traffic matching the classifier to the next functional data path
   element.  If the "next" pointer is zeroDotZero, the indication is
   that there is no further differentiated services processing for this
   behavior aggregate.  However, if the "specific" pointer is
   zeroDotZero, the device is misconfigured.  In such a case, the
   classifier element should be operationally treated as if it were not
   present.

   When the MIB is used for configuration, diffServClfrNextFree and
   diffServClfrElementNextFree always contain legal values for
   diffServClfrId and diffServClfrElementId that are not currently used

   in the system's configuration.  The values are validated when
   creating diffServClfrId and diffServClfrElementId, and in the event
   of a failure (which would happen if two managers simultaneously
   attempted to create an entry) must be re-read.

   This MIB defines a single parameter type for classification, the
   Multi-field Classifier.  As a parameter, a filter may be specified
   once and applied to many interfaces, using
   diffServClfrElementSpecific.  This filter matches:

      o  IP source address prefix, including host, CIDR Prefix, and "any
         source address"

      o  IP destination address prefix, including host, CIDR Prefix, and
         "any destination address"

      o  IPv6 Flow ID

      o  IP protocol or "any"

      o  TCP/UDP/SCTP source port range, including "any"

      o  TCP/UDP/SCTP destination port range, including "any"

      o  Differentiated Services Code Point

   Since port ranges, IP prefixes, or "any" are defined in each case, it
   is clear that a wide variety of filters can be constructed.  The
   Differentiated Services Behavior Aggregate filter is a special case
   of this filter, in which only the DSCP is specified.

   Other MIB modules may define similar filters in the same way.  For
   example, a filter for Ethernet information might define source and
   destination MAC addresses of "any", Ethernet Packet Type, IEEE 802.2
   SAPs, and IEEE 802.1 priorities.  A filter related to policy routing
   might be structured like the diffServMultiFieldClfrTable, but contain
   the BGP Communities of the source and destination prefix rather than
   the prefix itself, meaning "any prefix in this community".  For such
   a filter, a table similar to diffServMultiFieldClfrTable is
   constructed, and diffServClfrElementSpecific is configured to point
   to it.

   As discussed in [<a href="#ref-MODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for Differentiated Services Routers"'>MODEL</a>], a meter and a shaper are functions that
   operate on opposing ends of a link.  A shaper schedules traffic for
   transmission at specific times in order to approximate a particular
   line speed or combination of line speeds.  In its simplest form, if
   the traffic stream contains constant sized packets, it might transmit
   one packet per unit time to build the equivalent of a CBR circuit.
   However, various factors intervene to make the approximation inexact;
   multiple classes of traffic may occasionally schedule their traffic
   at the same time, the variable length nature of IP traffic may
   introduce variation, and factors in the link or physical layer may
   change traffic timing.  A meter integrates the arrival rate of
   traffic and determines whether the shaper at the far end was
   correctly applied, or whether the behavior of the application in
   question is naturally close enough to such behavior to be acceptable
   under a given policy.

   A common type of meter is a Token Bucket meter, such as [<a href="#ref-srTCM" title='"A Single Rate Three Color Marker"'>srTCM</a>] or
   [<a href="#ref-trTCM" title='"A Two Rate Three Color Marker"'>trTCM</a>].  This type of meter assumes the use of a shaper at a
   previous node; applications which send at a constant rate when
   sending may conform if the token bucket is properly specified.  It
   specifies the acceptable arrival rate and quantifies the acceptable
   variability, often by specifying a burst size or an interval; since
   rate = quantity/time, specifying any two of those parameters implies
   the third, and a large interval provides for a forgiving system.
   Multiple rates may be specified, as in AF, such that a subset of the
   traffic (up to one rate) is accepted with one set of guarantees, and
   traffic in excess of that but below another rate has a different set
   of guarantees.  Other types of meters exist as well.

   One use of a meter is when a service provider sells at most, a
   certain bit rate to one of its customers, and wants to drop the
   excess.  In such a case, the fractal nature of normal Internet
   traffic must be reflected in large burst intervals, as TCP frequently
   sends packet pairs or larger bursts, and responds poorly when more
   than one packet in a round trip interval is dropped.  Applications
   like FTP contain the effect by simply staying below the target bit
   rate; this type of configuration very adversely affects transaction
   applications like HTTP, however.  Another use of a meter is in the AF
   specification, in which excess traffic is marked with a related DSCP
   and subjected to slightly more active queue depth management.  The

   application is not sharply limited to a contracted rate in such a

   The Meter Table is a structural table, specifying a specific
   functional data path element.  Its entry consists essentially of
   three RowPointers - a "succeed" pointer, for traffic conforming to
   the meter, a "fail" pointer, for traffic not conforming to the meter,
   and a "specific" pointer, to identify the parameters in question.
   This structure is a bow to SNMP's limitations; it would be better to
   have a structure with N rates and N+1 "next" pointers, with a single
   algorithm specified.  In this case, multiple meter entries connected
   by the "fail" link are understood to contain the parameters for a
   specified algorithm, and traffic conforming to a given rate follows
   their "succeed" paths.  Within this MIB, only Token Bucket parameters
   are specified; other varieties of meters may be designed in other MIB
   modules.

   When the MIB is used for configuration, diffServMeterNextFree always
   contains a legal value for diffServMeterId that is not currently used
   in the system's configuration.

   The Token Bucket Parameters Table is a set of parameters that define
   a Token Bucket Meter.  As a parameter, a token bucket may be
   specified once and applied to many interfaces, using
   diffServMeterSpecific.  Specifically, several modes of [<a href="#ref-srTCM" title='"A Single Rate Three Color Marker"'>srTCM</a>] and
   [<a href="#ref-trTCM" title='"A Two Rate Three Color Marker"'>trTCM</a>] are addressed.  Other varieties of meters may be specified in
   other MIB modules.

   In general, if a Token Bucket has N rates, it has N+1 potential
   outcomes - the traffic stream is slower than and therefore conforms
   to all of the rates, it fails the first few but is slower than and
   therefore conforms to the higher rates, or it fails all of them.  As
   such, multi-rate meters should specify those rates in monotonically
   increasing order, passing through the diffServMeterFailNext from more
   committed to more excess rates, and finally falling through
   diffServMeterFailNext to the set of actions that apply to traffic
   which conforms to none of the specified rates.  diffServTBParamType
   in the first entry indicates the algorithm being used.  At each rate,
   diffServTBParamRate is derivable from diffServTBParamBurstSize and
   diffServTBParamInterval; a superior implementation will allow the

   "Actions" are the things a differentiated services interface PHB may
   do to a packet in transit.  At a minimum, such a policy might
   calculate statistics on traffic in various configured classes, mark
   it with a DSCP, drop it, or enqueue it before passing it on for other
   processing.

   Actions are composed of a structural element, the
   diffServActionTable, and various component action entries that may be
   applied.  In the case of the Algorithmic Dropper, an additional
   parameter table may be specified to control Active Queue Management,
   as defined in [<a href="#ref-RED93" title='"Random Early Detection"'>RED93</a>] and other AQM specifications.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.4.1.%20%20diffServActionTable%20-%20The%20Action%20Table"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4.1" name="section-3.4.1">3.4.1</a>.  diffServActionTable - The Action Table</span>

   The action table identifies sequences of actions to be applied to a
   packet.  Successive actions are chained through diffServActionNext,
   ultimately resulting in zeroDotZero (indicating that the policy is
   complete), a pointer to a queue, or a pointer to some other
   functional data path element.

   When the MIB is used for configuration, diffServActionNextFree always
   contains a legal value for diffServActionId that is not currently
   used in the system's configuration.

   The count action accumulates statistics pertaining to traffic passing
   through a given path through the policy.  It is intended to be useful
   for usage-based billing, for statistical studies, or for analysis of
   the behavior of a policy in a given network.  The objects in the
   Count Action are various counters and a discontinuity time.  The
   counters display the number of packets and bytes encountered on the
   path since the discontinuity time.  They share the same discontinuity
   time, which is the discontinuity time of the interface or agent.

   The designers of this MIB expect that every path through a policy
   should have a corresponding counter.  In early versions, it was
   impossible to configure an action without implementing a counter,
   although the current design makes them in effect the network
   manager's option, as a result of making actions consistent in
   structure and extensibility.  The assurance of proper debugging and
   accounting is therefore left with the policy designer.

   When the MIB is used for configuration, diffServCountActNextFree
   always contains a legal value for diffServCountActId that is not
   currently used in the system's configuration.

   The Mark Action table is an unusual table, both in SNMP and in this
   MIB.  It might be viewed not so much as an array of single-object
   entries as an array of OBJECT-IDENTIFIER conventions, as the OID for
   a diffServDscpMarkActDscp instance conveys all of the necessary
   information: packets are to be marked with the requisite DSCP.

   As such, contrary to common practice, the index for the table is
   read- only, and is both the Entry's index and its only value.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.4.4.%20%20diffServAlgDropTable%20-%20The%20Algorithmic%20Drop%20Table"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4.4" name="section-3.4.4">3.4.4</a>.  diffServAlgDropTable - The Algorithmic Drop Table</span>

   The Algorithmic Drop Table identifies a dropping algorithm, drops
   packets, and counts the drops.  Classified as an action, it is in
   effect a method which applies a packet to a queue, and may modify
   either.  When the algorithm is "always drop", this is simple; when
   the algorithm calls for head-drop, tail-drop, or a variety of Active
   Queue Management, the queue is inspected, and in the case of Active
   Queue Management, additional parameters are REQUIRED.

   What may not be clear from the name is that an Algorithmic Drop
   action often does not drop traffic.  Algorithms other than "always
   drop" normally drop a few percent of packets at most.  The action
   inspects the diffServQEntry that diffServAlgDropQMeasure points to in
   order to determine whether the packet should be dropped.

   When the MIB is used for configuration, diffServAlgDropNextFree
   always contains a legal value for diffServAlgDropId that is not

   The Random Drop Table is an extension of the Algorithmic Drop Table
   intended for use on queues whose depth is actively managed.  Active
   Queue Management algorithms are typified by [<a href="#ref-RED93" title='"Random Early Detection"'>RED93</a>], but the
   parameters they use vary.  It was deemed for the purposes of this MIB
   that the proper values to represent include:

      o  Target case mean queue depth, expressed in bytes or packets

      o  Worst case mean queue depth, expressed in bytes or packets

      o  Maximum drop rate expressed as drops per thousand

      o  Coefficient of an exponentially weighted moving average,
         expressed as the numerator of a fraction whose denominator is
         65536.

      o  Sampling rate

   An example of the representation chosen in this MIB for this element
   is shown in Figure 1.

   Random droppers often have their drop probability function described
   as a plot of drop probability (P) against averaged queue length (Q).
   (Qmin,Pmin) then defines the start of the characteristic plot.
   Normally Pmin=0, meaning with average queue length below Qmin, there
   will be no drops.  (Qmax,Pmax) defines a "knee" on the plot, after
   which point the drop probability becomes more progressive (greater
   slope).  (Qclip,1) defines the queue length at which all packets will
   be dropped.  Notice this is different from Tail Drop because this
   uses an averaged queue length, although it is possible for Qclip to
   equal Qmax.

   In the MIB module, diffServRandomDropMinThreshBytes and
   diffServRandomDropMinThreshPkts represent Qmin.
   diffServRandomDropMaxThreshBytes and diffServRandomDropMaxThreshPkts
   represent Qmax.  diffServAlgDropQThreshold represents Qclip.
   diffServRandomDropInvProbMax represents Pmax (inverse).  This MIB
   does not represent Pmin (assumed to be zero unless otherwise
   represented).  In addition, since message memory is finite, queues
   generally have some upper bound above which they are incapable of
   storing additional traffic.  Normally this number is equal to Qclip,
   specified by diffServAlgDropQThreshold.

    Figure 1: Example Use of the RandomDropTable for Random Droppers

   Each random dropper specification is associated with a queue.  This
   allows multiple drop processes (of same or different types) to be
   associated with the same queue, as different PHB implementations may
   require.  This also allows for sequences of multiple droppers if
   necessary.

   The calculation of a smoothed queue length may also have an important
   bearing on the behavior of the dropper: parameters may include the
   sampling interval or rate, and the weight of each sample.  The
   performance may be very sensitive to the values of these parameters
   and a wide range of possible values may be required due to a wide
   range of link speeds.  Most algorithms include a sample weight,
   represented here by diffServRandomDropWeight.  The availability of
   diffServRandomDropSamplingRate as readable is important, the
   information provided by Sampling Rate is essential to the
   configuration of diffServRandomDropWeight.  Having Sampling Rate be
   configurable is also helpful, as line speed increases, the ability to
   have queue sampling be less frequent than packet arrival is needed.
   Note, however, that there is ongoing research on this topic, see e.g.
   [<a href="#ref-ACTQMGMT" title='"A Study of Active Queue Management for Congestion Control"'>ACTQMGMT</a>] and [<a href="#ref-AQMROUTER" title='"Fluid-based analysis of a network of AQM routers supporting TCP flows with an application to RED"'>AQMROUTER</a>].

   Additional parameters may be added in an enterprise MIB module, e.g.
   by using AUGMENTS on this table, to handle aspects of random drop
   algorithms that are not standardized here.

   When the MIB is used for configuration, diffServRandomDropNextFree
   always contains a legal value for diffServRandomDropId that is not
   currently used in the system's configuration.

   These include Queues and Schedulers, which are inter-related in their
   use of queuing techniques.  By doing so, it is possible to build
   multi-level schedulers, such as those which treat a set of queues as
   having priority among them, and at a specific priority find a
   secondary WFQ scheduler with some number of queues.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.5.1.%20%20diffServQTable%20-%20The%20Class%20or%20Queue%20Table"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5.1" name="section-3.5.1">3.5.1</a>.  diffServQTable - The Class or Queue Table</span>

   The Queue Table models simple FIFO queues.  The Scheduler Table
   allows flexibility in constructing both simple and somewhat more
   complex queuing hierarchies from those queues.

   Queue Table entries are pointed at by the "next" attributes of the
   upstream elements, such as diffServMeterSucceedNext or
   diffServActionNext.  Note that multiple upstream elements may direct
   their traffic to the same Queue Table entry.  For example, the
   Assured Forwarding PHB suggests that all traffic marked AF11, AF12 or
   AF13 be placed in the same queue, after metering, without reordering.
   To accomplish that, the upstream diffServAlgDropNext pointers each
   point to the same diffServQEntry.

   A common requirement of a queue is that its traffic enjoy a certain
   minimum or maximum rate, or that it be given a certain priority.
   Functionally, the selection of such is a function of a scheduler.
   The parameter is associated with the queue, however, using the
   Minimum or Maximum Rate Parameters Table.

   When the MIB is used for configuration, diffServQNextFree always
   contains a legal value for diffServQId that is not currently used in

   The scheduler, and therefore the Scheduler Table, accepts inputs from
   either queues or a preceding scheduler.  The Scheduler Table allows
   flexibility in constructing both simple and somewhat more complex
   queuing hierarchies from those queues.

   When the output rate of a queue or scheduler must be given a minimum
   rate or a priority, this is done using the diffServMinRateTable.

   Rates may be expressed as absolute rates, or as a fraction of
   ifSpeed, and imply the use of a rate-based scheduler such as WFQ or
   WRR.  The use of a priority implies the use of a Priority Scheduler.
   Only one of the Absolute or Relative rates needs to be set; the other
   takes the relevant value as a result.  Excess capacity is distributed
   proportionally among the inputs to a scheduler using the assured
   rate.  More complex functionality may be described by augmenting this
   MIB.

   When a priority scheduler is used, its effect is to give the queue
   the entire capacity of the subject interface less the capacity used
   by higher priorities, if there is traffic present to use it.  This is
   true regardless of the rate specifications applied to that queue or
   other queues on the interface.  Policing excess traffic will mitigate
   this behavior.

   When the MIB is used for configuration, diffServMinRateNextFree
   always contains a legal value for diffServMinRateId that is not

   When the output rate of a queue or scheduler must be limited to at
   most a specified maximum rate, this is done using the
   diffServMaxRateTable.  Rates may be expressed as absolute rates, or
   as a fraction of ifSpeed.  Only one of the Absolute or Relative rate
   needs to be set; the other takes the relevant value as a result.

   The definition of a multirate shaper requires multiple
   diffServMaxRateEntries.  In this case, an algorithm such as [<a href="#ref-SHAPER" title='"A Rate Adaptive Shaper for Differentiated Services"'>SHAPER</a>]
   is used.  In that algorithm, more than one rate is specified, and at
   any given time traffic is shaped to the lowest specified rate which
   exceeds the arrival rate of traffic.

   When the MIB is used for configuration, diffServMaxRateNextFree
   always contains a legal value for diffServMaxRateId that is not

   For representing a Strict Priority scheduler, each scheduler input is
   assigned a priority with respect to all the other inputs feeding the
   same scheduler, with default values for the other parameters.
   Higher-priority traffic that is not being delayed for shaping will be
   serviced before a lower-priority input.  An example is found in
   Figure 2.

   For weighted scheduling methods, such as WFQ or WRR, the "weight" of
   a given scheduler input is represented with a Minimum Service Rate
   leaky-bucket profile which provides a guaranteed minimum bandwidth to
   that input, if required.  This is represented by a rate
   diffServMinRateAbsolute; the classical weight is the ratio between
   that rate and the interface speed, or perhaps the ratio between that
   rate and the sum of the configured rates for classes.  The rate may
   be represented by a relative value, as a fraction of the interface's
   current line rate, diffServMinRateRelative, to assist in cases where
   line rates are variable or where a higher-level policy might be
   expressed in terms of fractions of network resources.  The two rate
   parameters are inter-related and changes in one may be reflected in
   the other.  An example is found in figure 3.

            Figure 2: Priority Scheduler with two queues

   For weighted scheduling methods, one can say loosely, that WRR
   focuses on meeting bandwidth sharing, without concern for relative
   delay amongst the queues; where WFQ controls both queue the service
   order and the amount of traffic serviced, providing bandwidth sharing
   and relative delay ordering amongst the queues.

   A queue or scheduled set of queues (which is an input to a scheduler)
   may also be capable of acting as a non-work-conserving [<a href="#ref-MODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for Differentiated Services Routers"'>MODEL</a>]
   traffic shaper: this is done by defining a Maximum Service Rate
   leaky-bucket profile in order to limit the scheduler bandwidth
   available to that input.  This is represented by a rate, in
   diffServMaxRateAbsolute; the classical weight is the ratio between
   that rate and the interface speed, or perhaps the ratio between that
   rate and the sum of the configured rates for classes.  The rate may
   be represented by a relative value, as a fraction of the interface's
   current line rate, diffServMaxRateRelative.  This MIB presumes that
   shaping is something a scheduler does to its inputs, which it models
   as a queue with a maximum rate or a scheduler whose output has a

   The same may be done on a queue, if a given class is to be shaped to
   a maximum rate without shaping other classes, as in Figure 5.

   Other types of priority and weighted scheduling methods can be
   defined using existing parameters in diffServMinRateEntry.  NOTE:
   diffServSchedulerMethod uses OBJECT IDENTIFIER syntax, with the
   different types of scheduling methods defined as OBJECT-IDENTITY.

            Figure 5: Shaping one input to a work-conserving scheduler

   Future scheduling methods may be defined in other MIBs.  This
   requires an OBJECT-IDENTITY definition, a description of how the
   existing objects are reused, if they are, and any new objects they
   require.

   To implement an EF and two AF classes, one must use a combination of
   priority and WRR/WFQ scheduling.  This requires us to cascade two
   schedulers.  If one were to additionally shape the output of the
   system to a rate lower than the interface rate, one must place an
   upper bound rate on the output of the priority scheduler.  See figure
   6.

   For the sake of argument, let us build an example with one EF class
   and four AF classes using the constructs in this MIB.

   The ingress edge interface identifies traffic into classes, meters
   it, and ensures that any excess is appropriately dealt with according
   to the PHB.  For AF, this means marking excess; for EF, it means
   dropping excess or shaping it to a maximum rate.

   A packet arriving at an ingress interface picks up its policy from
   the diffServDataPathTable.  This points to a classifier, which will
   select traffic according to some specification for each traffic
   class.

   An example of a classifier for an AFm class would be a set of three
   classifier elements, each pointing to a Multi-field classification
   parameter block identifying one of the AFmn DSCPs.  Alternatively,
   the filters might contain selectors for HTTP traffic or some other
   application.

   An example of a classifier for EF traffic might be a classifier
   element pointing to a filter specifying the EF code point, a
   collection of classifiers with parameter blocks specifying individual
   telephone calls, or a variety of other approaches.

   Typically, of course, a classifier identifies a variety of traffic
   and breaks it up into separate classes.  It might very well contain
   fourteen classifier elements indicating the twelve AFmn DSCP values,
   EF, and "everything else".  These would presumably direct traffic
   down six functional data paths: one for each AF or EF class, and one
   for all other traffic.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.6.1.2.%20%20AF%20Implementation%20On%20an%20Ingress%20Edge%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6.1.2" name="section-3.6.1.2">3.6.1.2</a>.  AF Implementation On an Ingress Edge Interface</span>

   Each AFm class applies a Two Rate Three Color Meter, dividing traffic
   into three groups.  These groups of traffic conform to both specified
   rates, only the higher one, or none.  The intent, on the ingress
   interface at the edge of the network, is to measure and appropriately
   mark traffic.

<span class="h6"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.6.1.2.1.%20%20AF%20Metering%20On%20an%20Ingress%20Edge%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6.1.2.1" name="section-3.6.1.2.1">3.6.1.2.1</a>.  AF Metering On an Ingress Edge Interface</span>

   Each AFm class applies a Two Rate Three Color Meter, dividing traffic
   into three groups.  If two rates R and S, where R &lt; S, are specified
   and traffic arrives at rate T, traffic comprising up to R bits per
   second is considered to conform to the "confirmed" rate, R.  If
   R &lt; T, traffic comprising up to S-R bits per second is considered to
   conform to the "excess" rate, S.  Any further excess is non-
   conformant.

   Two meter entries are used to configure this, one for the conforming
   rate and one for the excess rate.  The rate parameters are stored in
   associated Token Bucket Parameter Entries.  The "FailNext" pointer of
   the lower rate Meter Entry points to the other Meter Entry; both
   "SucceedNext" pointers and the "FailNext" pointer of the higher Meter

   Entry point to lists of actions.  In the color-blind mode, all three
   classifier "next" entries point to the lower rate meter entry.  In
   the color-aware mode, the AFm1 classifier points to the lower rate
   entry, the AFm2 classifier points to the higher rate entry (as it is
   only compared against that rate), and the AFm3 classifier points
   directly to the actions taken when both rates fail.

   For network planning and perhaps for billing purposes, arriving
   traffic is normally counted.  Therefore, a "count" action, consisting
   of an action table entry pointing to a count table entry, is
   configured.

   Also, traffic is marked with the appropriate DSCP.  The first R bits
   per second are marked AFm1, the next S-R bits per second are marked
   AFm2, and the rest is marked AFm3.  It may be that traffic is
   arriving marked with the same DSCP, but in general, the additional
   complexity of deciding that it is being remarked to the same value is
   not useful.  Therefore, a "mark" action, consisting of an action
   table entry pointing to a mark table entry, is configured.

   At this point, the usual case is that traffic is now forwarded in the
   usual manner.  To indicate this, the "SucceedNext" pointer of the
   Mark Action is set to zeroDotZero.

   The EF class applies a Single Rate Two Color Meter, dividing traffic
   into "conforming" and "excess" groups.  The intent, on the ingress
   interface at the edge of the network, is to measure and appropriately
   mark conforming traffic and drop the excess.

<span class="h6"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.6.1.3.1.%20%20EF%20Metering%20On%20an%20Ingress%20Edge%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6.1.3.1" name="section-3.6.1.3.1">3.6.1.3.1</a>.  EF Metering On an Ingress Edge Interface</span>

   A single rate two color (srTCM) meter requires one token bucket.  It
   is therefore configured using a single meter entry with a
   corresponding Token Bucket Parameter Entry.  Arriving traffic either
   "succeeds" or "fails".

   For network planning and perhaps for billing purposes, arriving
   traffic that conforms to the meter is normally counted.  Therefore, a
   "count" action, consisting of an action table entry pointing to a
   count table entry, is configured.

   Also, traffic is (re)marked with the EF DSCP.  Therefore, a "mark"
   action, consisting of an action table entry pointing to a mark table
   entry, is configured.

   At this point, the successful traffic is now forwarded in the usual
   manner.  To indicate this, the "SucceedNext" pointer of the Mark
   Action is set to zeroDotZero.

   Traffic that exceeded the arrival policy, however, is to be dropped.
   One can use a count action on this traffic if the several counters
   are interesting.  However, since the drop counter in the Algorithmic
   Drop Entry will count packets dropped, this is not clearly necessary.
   An Algorithmic Drop Entry of the type "alwaysDrop" with no successor
   is sufficient.

   A packet arriving at an egress interface may have been classified on
   an ingress interface, and the egress interface may have access to
   that information.  If it is relevant, there is no reason not to use
   that information.  If it is not available, however, there may be a
   need to (re)classify on the egress interface.  In any event, it picks
   up its "program" from the diffServDataPathTable.  This points to a
   classifier, which will select traffic according to some specification
   for each traffic class.

          Figure 8: combined EF and AF implementation

   An example of a classifier for an AFm class would be a succession of
   three classifier elements, each pointing to a Multi-field
   classification parameter block identifying one of the AFmn DSCPs.
   Alternatively, the filter might contain selectors for HTTP traffic or
   some other application.

   An example of a classifier for EF traffic might be either a
   classifier element pointing to a Multi-field parameter specifying the
   EF code point, or a collection of classifiers with parameter blocks
   specifying individual telephone calls, or a variety of other
   approaches.

   Each classifier delivers traffic to appropriate functional data path
   elements.

   Each AFm class applies a Two Rate Three Color Meter, dividing traffic
   into three groups.  These groups of traffic conform to both specified
   rates, only the higher one, or none.  The intent, on the ingress
   interface at the edge of the network, is to measure and appropriately
   mark traffic.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.7.2.1.%20%20AF%20Metering%20On%20an%20Egress%20Edge%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.7.2.1" name="section-3.7.2.1">3.7.2.1</a>.  AF Metering On an Egress Edge Interface</span>

   Each AFm class applies a Two Rate Three Color Meter, dividing traffic
   into three groups.  If two rates R and S, where R &lt; S, are specified
   and traffic arrives at rate T, traffic comprising up to R bits per
   second is considered to conform to the "confirmed" rate, R.  If
   R &lt; T, traffic comprising up to S-R bits per second is considered to
   conform to the "excess" rate, S.  Any further excess is non-
   conformant.

   Two meter entries are used to configure this, one for the conforming
   rate and one for the excess rate.  The rate parameters are stored in
   associated Token Bucket Parameter Entries.  The "FailNext" pointer of
   the lower rate Meter Entry points to the other Meter Entry; both
   "SucceedNext" pointers and the "FailNext" pointer of the higher Meter
   Entry point to lists of actions.  In the color-blind mode, all three
   classifier "next" entries point to the lower rate meter entry.  In
   the color-aware mode, the AFm1 classifier points to the lower rate
   entry, the AFm2 classifier points to the higher rate entry (as it is
   only compared against that rate), and the AFm3 classifier points
   directly to the actions taken when both rates fail.

   For network planning and perhaps for billing purposes, departing
   traffic is normally counted.  Therefore, a "count" action, consisting
   of an action table entry pointing to a count table entry, is
   configured.

   Also, traffic may be marked with an appropriate DSCP.  The first R
   bits per second are marked AFm1, the next S-R bits per second are
   marked AFm2, and the rest is marked AFm3.  It may be that traffic is
   arriving marked with the same DSCP, but in general, the additional
   complexity of deciding that it is being remarked to the same value is
   not useful.  Therefore, a "mark" action, consisting of an action
   table entry pointing to a mark table entry, is configured.

   At this point, the usual case is that traffic is now queued for
   transmission.  The queue uses Active Queue Management, using an
   algorithm such as RED.  Therefore, an Algorithmic Dropper is

   configured for each AFmn traffic stream, with a slightly lower min-
   threshold (and possibly lower max-threshold) for the excess traffic
   than for the committed traffic.

   The queue expected by AF is normally a work-conserving queue.  It
   usually has a specified minimum rate, and may have a maximum rate
   below the bandwidth of the interface.  In concept, it will use as
   much bandwidth as is available to it, but assure the lower bound.

   Common ways to implement this include various forms of Weighted Fair
   Queuing (WFQ) or Weighted Round Robin (WRR).  Integrated over a
   longer interval, these give each class a predictable throughput rate.
   They differ in that over short intervals they will order traffic
   differently.  In general, traffic classes that keep traffic in queue
   will tend to absorb latency from queues with lower mean occupancy, in
   exchange for which they make use of any available capacity.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.7.3.%20%20EF%20Implementation%20On%20an%20Egress%20Edge%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.7.3" name="section-3.7.3">3.7.3</a>.  EF Implementation On an Egress Edge Interface</span>

   The EF class applies a Single Rate Two Color Meter, dividing traffic
   into "conforming" and "excess" groups.  The intent, on the egress
   interface at the edge of the network, is to measure and appropriately
   mark conforming traffic and drop the excess.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.7.3.1.%20%20EF%20Metering%20On%20an%20Egress%20Edge%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.7.3.1" name="section-3.7.3.1">3.7.3.1</a>.  EF Metering On an Egress Edge Interface</span>

   A single rate two color (srTCM) meter requires one token bucket.  It
   is therefore configured using a single meter entry with a
   corresponding Token Bucket Parameter Entry.  Arriving traffic either
   "succeeds" or "fails".

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.7.3.2.%20%20EF%20Actions%20On%20an%20Egress%20Edge%20Interface"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.7.3.2" name="section-3.7.3.2">3.7.3.2</a>.  EF Actions On an Egress Edge Interface</span>

   For network planning and perhaps for billing purposes, departing
   traffic that conforms to the meter is normally counted.  Therefore, a
   "count" action, consisting of an action table entry pointing to a
   count table entry, is configured.

   Also, traffic is (re)marked with the EF DSCP.  Therefore, a "mark"
   action, consisting of an action table entry pointing to a mark table
   entry, is configured.

      Figure 12: Typical EF Core interface Configuration

   At this point, the successful traffic is now queued for transmission,
   using a priority queue or perhaps a rate-based queue with significant
   over-provision.  Since the amount of traffic present is known, one
   might not drop from this queue at all.

   Traffic that exceeded the policy, however, is dropped.  A count
   action can be used on this traffic if the several counters are
   interesting.  However, since the drop counter in the Algorithmic Drop
   Entry will count packets dropped, this is not clearly necessary.  An
   Algorithmic Drop Entry of the type "alwaysDrop" with no successor is
   sufficient.

   The normal implementation is a priority queue, to minimize induced
   jitter.  A separate queue is used for each EF class, with a strict
   ordering.

   RowPointer is a textual convention used to identify a conceptual row
   in a MIB Table by pointing to one of its objects.  One of the ways
   this MIB uses it is to indicate succession, pointing to data path
   linkage table entries.

   For succession, it answers the question "what happens next?".  Rather
   than presume that the next table must be as specified in the
   conceptual model [<a href="#ref-MODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for Differentiated Services Routers"'>MODEL</a>] and providing its index, the RowPointer
   takes you to the MIB row representing that thing.  In the
   diffServMeterTable, for example, the diffServMeterFailNext RowPointer
   might take you to another meter, while the diffServMeterSucceedNext
   RowPointer would take you to an action.

   Since a RowPointer is not tied to any specific object except by the
   value it contains, it is possible and acceptable to use RowPointers
   to merge data paths.  An obvious example of such a use is in the
   classifier: traffic matching the DSCPs AF11, AF12, and AF13 might be
   presented to the same meter in order to perform the processing
   described in the Assured Forwarding PHB.  Another use would be to
   merge data paths from several interfaces; if they represent a single
   service contract, having them share a common set of counters and
   common policy may be a desirable configuration.  Note well, however,
   that such configurations may have related implementation issues - if
   Differentiated Services processing for the interfaces is implemented
   in multiple forwarding engines, the engines will need to communicate
   if they are to implement such a feature.  An implementation that
   fails to provide this capability is not considered to have failed the
   intention of this MIB or of the [<a href="#ref-MODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for Differentiated Services Routers"'>MODEL</a>]; an implementation that does
   provide it is not considered superior from a standards perspective.

      NOTE -- the RowPointer construct is used to connect the functional
      data paths.  The [<a href="#ref-MODEL" title='"An Informal Management Model for Differentiated Services Routers"'>MODEL</a>] describes these as TCBs, as an aid to
      understanding.  This MIB, however, does not model TCBs directly.
      It operates at a lower level of abstraction using only individual
      elements, connected in succession by RowPointers.  Therefore, the
      concept of TCBs enclosing individual Functional Data Path elements
      is not directly applicable to this MIB, although management tools
      that use this MIB may employ such a concept.

   It is possible that a path through a device following a set of
   RowPointers is indeterminate i.e. it ends in a dangling RowPointer.
   Guidance is provided in the MIB module's DESCRIPTION-clause for each
   of the linkage attribute.  In general, for both zeroDotZero and
   dangling RowPointer, it is assumed the data path ends and the traffic

   should be given to the next logical part of the device, usually a
   forwarding process or a transmission engine, or the proverbial bit-
   bucket.  Any variation from this usage is indicated by the attribute
   affected.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20The%20use%20of%20RowPointer%20to%20indicate%20parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  The use of RowPointer to indicate parameters</span>

   RowPointer is also used in this MIB to indicate parameterization, for
   pointing to parameterization table entries.

   For indirection (as in the diffServClfrElementTable), the idea is to
   allow other MIBs, including proprietary ones, to define new and
   arcane filters - MAC headers, IPv4 and IPv6 headers, BGP Communities
   and all sorts of other things - while still utilizing the structures
   of this MIB.  This is a form of class inheritance (in "object
   oriented" language): it allows base object definitions ("classes") to
   be extended in proprietary or standard ways, in the future, by other
   documents.

   RowPointer also clearly indicates the identified conceptual row's
   content does not change, hence they can be simultaneously used and
   pointed to, by more than one data path linkage table entries.  The
   identification of RowPointer allows higher level policy mechanisms to
   take advantage of this characteristic.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20Conceptual%20row%20creation%20and%20deletion"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Conceptual row creation and deletion</span>

   A number of conceptual tables defined in this MIB use as an index an
   arbitrary integer value, unique across the scope of the agent.  In
   order to help with multi-manager row-creation problems, a mechanism
   must be provided to allow a manager to obtain unique values for such
   an index and to ensure that, when used, the manager knows whether it
   got what it wanted or not.

   Typically, such a table has an associated NextFree variable e.g.
   diffServClfrNextFree which provides a suitable value for the index of
   the next row to be created e.g. diffServClfrId.  The value zero is
   used to indicate that the agent can configure no more entries.  The
   table also has a columnar Status attribute with RowStatus syntax [RFC
   2579].

   Generally, if a manager attempts to create a row, the agent will
   create the row and return success.  If the agent has insufficient
   resources or such a row already exists, then it returns an error.  A
   manager must be prepared to try again in such circumstances, probably
   by re-reading the NextFree to obtain a new index value in case a
   second manager had got in between the first manager's read of the
   NextFree value and the first manager's row-creation attempt.

   To simplify management creation and deletion of rows in this MIB, the
   agent is expected to assist in maintaining its consistency.  It may
   accomplish this by maintaining internal usage counters for any row
   that might be pointed to by a RowPointer, or by any equivalent means.
   When a RowPointer is created or written, and the row it points to
   does not exist, the SET returns an inconsistentValue error.  When a
   RowStatus variable is set to 'destroy' but the usage counter is non-
   zero, the SET returns no error but the indicated row is left intact.
   The agent should later remove the row in the event that the usage
   counter becomes zero.

   The use of RowStatus is covered in more detail in [<a href="rfc2579.html">RFC 2579</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Extending%20this%20MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Extending this MIB</span>

   With the structures of this MIB divided into data path linkage tables
   and parameterization tables, and with the use of RowPointer, new data
   path linkage and parameterization tables can be defined in other MIB
   modules, and used with tables defined in this MIB.  This MIB does not
   limit the type of entries its RowPointer attributes can point to,
   hence new functional data path elements can be defined in other MIBs
   and integrated with functional data path elements of this MIB.  For
   example, new Action functional data path element can be defined for
   Traffic Engineering and be integrated with Differentiated Services
   functional data path elements, possibly used within the same data
   path sharing the same classifiers and meters.

   It is more likely that new parameterization tables will be created in
   other MIBs as new methods or proprietary methods get deployed for
   existing Differentiated Services Functional Data Path Elements.  For
   example, different kinds of filters can be defined by using new
   filter parameterization tables.  New scheduling methods can be
   deployed by defining new scheduling method OIDs and new scheduling
   parameter tables.

   Notice both new data path linkage tables and parameterization tables
   can be added without needing to change this MIB document or affect
   existing tables and their usage.

-- Classifier Table
--
-- The Classifier Table allows multiple classifier elements, of same or
-- different types, to be used together. A classifier must completely
-- classify all packets presented to it. This means that all traffic
-- presented to a classifier must match at least one classifier element
-- within the classifier, with the classifier element parameters
-- specified by a filter.

-- If there is ambiguity between classifier elements of different
-- classifier, classifier linkage order indicates their precedence; the
-- first classifier in the link is applied to the traffic first.

-- Entries in the classifier element table serves as the anchor for
-- each classification pattern, defined in filter table entries.  Each
-- classifier element table entry also specifies the subsequent
-- downstream Differentiated Services Functional Data Path Element when
-- the classification pattern is satisfied. Each entry in the
-- classifier element table describes one branch of the fan-out
-- characteristic of a classifier indicated in the Informal
-- Differentiated Services Model <a href="#section-4.1">section 4.1</a>.  A classifier is composed
-- of one or more classifier elements.

       One example of a filter table defined in this MIB is
       diffServMultiFieldClfrTable, for IP Multi-Field Classifiers

       micro-flow (an identifiable sub-session packet stream directed
       from one sending transport to the receiving transport or
       transports), or aggregates of those such as the traffic from a
       host, traffic for an application, or traffic between two hosts
       using an application and a given DSCP. The standard Behavior
       Aggregate used in the Differentiated Services Architecture is
       encoded as a degenerate case of such an aggregate - the traffic
       using a particular DSCP value.

       Filter tables for other filter types may be defined elsewhere."

--
-- This MIB supports a variety of Meters.  It includes a specific
-- definition for Token Bucket Meter, which are but one type of
-- specification. Other metering parameter sets can be defined in other
-- MIBs.

-- Multiple meter elements may be logically cascaded using their
-- diffServMeterSucceedNext and diffServMeterFailNext pointers if
-- required. One example of this might be for an AF PHB implementation
-- that uses multiple level conformance meters.

-- Cascading of individual meter elements in the MIB is intended to be
-- functionally equivalent to multiple level conformance determination
-- of a packet.  The sequential nature of the representation is merely
-- a notational convenience for this MIB.

-- srTCM meters (<a href="rfc2697.html">RFC 2697</a>) can be specified using two sets of
-- diffServMeterEntry and diffServTBParamEntry. The first set specifies
-- the Committed Information Rate and Committed Burst Size
-- token-bucket.  The second set specifies the Excess Burst Size
-- token-bucket.

-- trTCM meters (<a href="rfc2698.html">RFC 2698</a>) can be specified using two sets of
-- diffServMeterEntry and diffServTBParamEntry. The first set specifies
-- the Committed Information Rate and Committed Burst Size
-- token-bucket.  The second set specifies the Peak Information Rate
-- and Peak Burst Size token-bucket.

-- tswTCM meters (<a href="rfc2859.html">RFC 2859</a>) can be specified using two sets of

       diffServAlgDropQThreshold is understood to be the absolute
       maximum size of the queue and additional parameters are described
       in diffServRandomDropTable.

       The alwaysDrop(5) algorithm is as its name specifies; always
       drop. In this case, the other configuration values in this Entry
       are not meaningful; There is no useful 'next' processing step,
       there is no queue, and parameters describing the queue are not
       useful. Therefore, diffServAlgDropNext, diffServAlgDropMeasure,
       and diffServAlgDropSpecific are all zeroDotZero."

       When diffServAlgDropType is alwaysDrop(5), this object is
       ignored.

       Setting this to point to a target that does not exist results in
       an inconsistentValue error.  If the row pointed to is removed or

--
-- A Scheduler Entry represents a packet scheduler, such as a priority
-- scheduler or a WFQ scheduler. It provides flexibility for multiple
-- scheduling algorithms, each servicing multiple queues, to be used on
-- the same logical/physical interface.
--
-- Note that upstream queues or schedulers specify several of the
-- scheduler's parameters. These must be properly specified if the
-- scheduler is to behave as expected.
--
-- The diffServSchedulerMaxRate attribute specifies the parameters when
-- a scheduler's output is sent to another scheduler. This is used in
-- building hierarchical queues or schedulers.

-- parameters to the non-work-conserving portion of a scheduler:
-- non-work-conserving implies that the scheduler may sometimes not
-- emit a packet, even if there is data available at its input(s).
-- This has the effect of limiting the servicing of the queue/scheduler
-- input or output, in effect performing shaping of the packet stream
-- passing through the queue/scheduler, as described in the Informal
-- Differentiated Services Model <a href="#section-7.2">section 7.2</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20Acknowledgments"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  Acknowledgments</span>

   This MIB builds on all the work that has gone into the Informal
   Management Model for Differentiated Services Routers, Differentiated
   Services PIB, and Differentiated Services Policy MIB (SNMPCONF WG).

   It has been developed with the active involvement of many people, but
   most notably Yoram Bernet, Steve Blake, Brian Carpenter, Dave Durham,
   Michael Fine, Victor Firoiu, Jeremy Greene, Dan Grossman, Roch
   Guerin, Scott Hahn, Joel Halpern, Van Jacobsen, Keith McCloghrie, Bob
   Moore, Kathleen Nichols, Ping Pan, Nabil Seddigh, John Seligson, and
   Walter Weiss.

   Juergen Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, Frank Strauss, Harrie
   Hazewinkel, and Bert Wijnen are especially to be noted for review
   comments on the structure and usage of the MIB for network management
   purposes, and its compliance with SMIv2.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" name="section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   It is clear that this MIB is potentially useful for configuration.
   Anything that can be configured can be misconfigured, with
   potentially disastrous effects.

   At this writing, no security holes have been identified beyond those
   that SNMP Security is itself intended to address.  These relate
   primarily to controlled access to sensitive information and the
   ability to configure a device - or which might result from operator
   error, which is beyond the scope of any security architecture.

   There are many read-write and read-create management objects defined
   in this MIB.  Such objects are often sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  The use of SNMP Version 3 is recommended over
   prior versions for configuration control as its security model is
   improved.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   information that may be sensitive from a business perspective, in
   that they may represent a customer's service contract or the filters
   that the service provider chooses to apply to a customer's ingress or
   egress traffic.  There are no objects which are sensitive in their
   own right, such as passwords or monetary amounts.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3289.html">RFC 3289</a>              Differentiated Services MIB               May 2002</span>


   It may be important to even control GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide
   features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [<a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a>] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [<a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a>] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
