Abstract

   The United States government has published guidelines for "NSA
   Suite B Cryptography", which defines cryptographic algorithm policy
   for national security applications.  This document specifies a
   profile of the Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) protocol for
   managing Suite B X.509 public key certificates.  This profile is a
   refinement of RFCs 5272, 5273, and 5274.

   This document specifies a profile for using the Certificate
   Management over CMS (CMC) protocol, defined in [<a href="rfc5272.html" title='"Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)"'>RFC5272</a>], [<a href="rfc5273.html" title='"Certificate Management over CMS (CMC): Transport Protocols"'>RFC5273</a>],
   and [<a href="rfc5274.html" title='"Certificate Management Messages over CMS (CMC): Compliance Requirements"'>RFC5274</a>], and updated by [<a href="rfc6402.html" title='"Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) Updates"'>RFC6402</a>], to manage X.509 public key
   certificates compliant with the United States National Security
   Agency's Suite B Cryptography as defined in the Suite B Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile [<a href="rfc5759.html" title='"Suite B Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile"'>RFC5759</a>].  This
   document specifically focuses on defining CMC interactions for both
   initial enrollment and rekey of Suite B public key certificates
   between a client and a Certification Authority (CA).  One or more
   Registration Authorities (RAs) may act as intermediaries between the
   client and the CA.  This profile may be further tailored by specific
   communities to meet their needs.  Specific communities will also
   define Certificate Policies that implementations need to comply with.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   The terminology in <a href="rfc5272.html#section-2.1">[RFC5272] Section 2.1</a> applies to this profile.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Requirements%20and%20Assumptions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Requirements and Assumptions</span>

   All key pairs are on either the curve P-256 or the curve P-384.  FIPS
   186-3 [<a href="#ref-DSS" title=" FIPS 186-3: Digital Signature Standard (DSS)">DSS</a>], <a href="#appendix-B.4">Appendix B.4</a>, provides useful guidance for elliptic
   curve key pair generation that SHOULD be followed by systems that
   conform to this document.

   This document assumes that the required trust anchors have been
   securely provisioned to the client and, when applicable, to any RAs.

   All requirements in [<a href="rfc5272.html" title='"Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)"'>RFC5272</a>], [<a href="rfc5273.html" title='"Certificate Management over CMS (CMC): Transport Protocols"'>RFC5273</a>], [<a href="rfc5274.html" title='"Certificate Management Messages over CMS (CMC): Compliance Requirements"'>RFC5274</a>], and [<a href="rfc6402.html" title='"Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) Updates"'>RFC6402</a>]
   apply, except where overridden by this profile.

   This profile was developed with the scenarios described in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>
   in mind.  However, use of this profile is not limited to just those
   scenarios.

   The term "client" in this profile typically refers to an end-entity.
   However, it may instead refer to a third party acting on the end-
   entity's behalf.  The client may or may not be the entity that



<span class="grey">Zieglar, et al.               Informational                     [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-3" id="page-3" name="page-3"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6403.html">RFC 6403</a>                   Suite B CMC Profile             November 2011</span>


   actually generates the key pair, but it does perform the CMC protocol
   interactions with the RA and/or CA.  For example, the client may be a
   token management system that communicates with a cryptographic token
   through an out-of-band secure protocol.

   This profile uses the term "rekey" in the same manner as does CMC
   (defined in <a href="rfc5272.html#section-2">Section 2 of [RFC5272]</a>).  The profile makes no specific
   statements about the ability to do "renewal" operations; however, the
   statements applicable to rekey should be applied to renewal as well.

   This profile may be used to manage RA and/or CA certificates.  In
   that case, the RA and/or CA whose certificate is being managed is
   considered to be the end-entity.

   This profile does not support key establishment certification
   requests from cryptographic modules that cannot generate a one-time
   signature with a key establishment key for proof-of-possession
   purposes.  In that case, a separate profile would be needed to define
   the use of another proof-of-possession technique.

   This section specifies the conventions employed when a client
   requests a certificate from a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

   The Full PKI Request MUST be used; it MUST be encapsulated in a
   SignedData; and the SignedData MUST be constructed as defined in
   [<a href="rfc6318.html" title='"Suite B in Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)"'>RFC6318</a>].  The PKIData content type complies with [<a href="rfc5272.html" title='"Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)"'>RFC5272</a>] with the
   following additional requirements:

   o  controlSequence SHOULD be present, and it SHOULD include the
      following CMC controls: Transaction ID and Sender Nonce.  Other
      CMC controls MAY be included.  If the request is being
      authenticated using a shared-secret, then the following
      requirements in this paragraph apply:  Identity Proof Version 2
      control, as defined in [<a href="rfc5272.html" title='"Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)"'>RFC5272</a>], MUST be included; hashAlgId MUST
      be id-sha256 or id-sha384 for P-256 certification requests, and
      MUST be id-sha384 for P-384 certification requests (both algorithm
      OIDs are defined in [<a href="rfc5754.html" title='"Using SHA2 Algorithms with Cryptographic Message Syntax"'>RFC5754</a>]); macAlgId MUST be HMAC-SHA256 when
      the hashAlgId is id-sha256, and MUST be HMAC-SHA384 when the
      hashAlgId is id-sha384 (both HMAC algorithms are defined in
      [<a href="rfc4231.html" title='"Identifiers and Test Vectors for HMAC- SHA-224, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512"'>RFC4231</a>]).  If the subject included in the certification request
      is NULL or otherwise does not uniquely identify the end-entity,
      then the POP Link Random control MUST be included, and the POP
      Link Witness Version 2 control MUST be included in the inner PKCS
      #10 or Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) request as
      described in Sections <a href="#section-4.1">4.1</a> and <a href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.

      (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>) or crm (see <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>) TaggedRequest.  Support
      for the orm choice is OPTIONAL.

   If the Full PKI Request contains a P-256 public key certification
   request, then the SignedData encapsulating the Full PKI Request MUST
   be generated using either SHA-256 and ECDSA on P-256 or using SHA-384
   and ECDSA on P-384.  If the Full PKI Request contains a P-384 public
   key certification request, then the SignedData MUST be generated
   using SHA-384 and ECDSA on P-384.

   A Full PKI Request MUST be signed using the private key that
   corresponds to the public key of an existing signature certificate
   unless an appropriate signature certificate does not yet exist, such
   as during initial enrollment.

   If an appropriate signature certificate does not yet exist, and if a
   Full PKI Request includes one or more certification requests and is
   authenticated using a shared-secret (because no appropriate
   certificate exists yet to authenticate the request), the Full PKI
   Request MUST be signed using the private key corresponding to the
   public key of one of the requested certificates.  When necessary
   (i.e., because there is no existing signature certificate and there
   is no signature certification request included), a Full PKI Request
   MAY be signed using a key pair intended for use in a key
   establishment certificate.  However, servers are not required to
   allow this behavior.

   responses through an implementation-specific mechanism.

   When a newly issued certificate is included in the PKI Response, the
   client MUST verify that the newly issued certificate's public key
   matches the public key that the client requested.  The client MUST
   also ensure that the certificate's signature is valid and that the
   signature validates back to an acceptable trust anchor.

   Clients MUST reject PKI Responses that do not pass these tests.
   Local policy will determine whether the client returns a Full PKI
   Response with an Extended CMC Status Info control with CMCStatus set
   to failed to a user console, error log, or the server.

   If the Full PKI Response contains an Extended Status Info with a
   CMCStatus set to failed, then local policy will determine whether the
   client resends a duplicate certification request back to the server
   or an error state is returned to a console or error log.

   When the Identity Proof V2 and POP Link Witness V2 controls are used,
   the shared-secret MUST be randomly generated and securely
   distributed.  The shared-secret MUST provide at least 128 bits of
   strength for P-256 certification requests and at least 192 bits of

   Protocol security considerations are found in [<a href="rfc2986.html" title='"PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax Specification Version 1.7"'>RFC2986</a>], [<a href="rfc4211.html" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)"'>RFC4211</a>],

   When CCC is used to authorize RA and CA certificates, then the
   security considerations in [<a href="rfc6010.html" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) Content Constraints Extension"'>RFC6010</a>] also apply.  Algorithm security
   considerations are found in [<a href="rfc6318.html" title='"Suite B in Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)"'>RFC6318</a>].

   Compliant with NIST Special Publication 800-57 [<a href="#ref-SP80057" title=" Special Publication 800-57 Part 1: Recommendation for Key Management">SP80057</a>], this
   profile defines proof-of-possession of a key establishment private
   key by performing a digital signature.  Except for one-time proof-of-
   possession, a single key pair MUST NOT be used for both signature and
   key establishment.

   This specification requires implementations to generate key pairs and
   other random values.  The use of inadequate pseudo-random number
   generators (PRNGs) can result in little or no security.  The
   generation of quality random numbers is difficult.  NIST Special
   Publication 800-90 [<a href="#ref-SP80090" title=" Special Publication 800-90: Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Number Bits Generators (Revised)">SP80090</a>], FIPS 186-3 [<a href="#ref-DSS" title=" FIPS 186-3: Digital Signature Standard (DSS)">DSS</a>], and [<a href="rfc4086.html" title='"Randomness Requirements for Security"'>RFC4086</a>] offer
   random number generation guidance.

   When RAs are used, the list of authorized RAs must be securely

   Presence of the POP Link Witness Version 2 and POP Link Random

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6403.html">RFC 6403</a>                   Suite B CMC Profile             November 2011</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Scenarios"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" name="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Scenarios</span>

   This section illustrates several potential certificate enrollment and
   rekey scenarios supported by this profile.  This section does not
   intend to place any limits or restrictions on the use of CMC.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.1.%20%20Initial%20Enrollment"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" name="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Initial Enrollment</span>

   This section describes three scenarios for authenticating initial
   enrollment requests:

   1. Previously installed signature certificate (e.g., Manufacturer
      Installed Certificate);

   2. Shared-secret distributed securely out-of-band;

   3. RA authentication.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.1.1.%20%20Previously%20Installed%20Signature%20Certificate"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1.1" name="appendix-A.1.1">A.1.1</a>.  Previously Installed Signature Certificate</span>

   In this scenario, the end-entity has had a signature certificate
   installed by the cryptographic module manufacturer.  As the end-
   entity already has a signature certificate, it can be used to
   authenticate a request for a new certificate.  The end-entity signs
   the Full PKI Request with the private key that corresponds to the
   subject public key of a previously installed signature certificate.
   The CA will recognize the authorization of the previously installed
   certificate and issue an appropriate certificate to the end-entity.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.1.2.%20%20Shared-Secret%20Distributed%20Securely%20Out-of-Band"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1.2" name="appendix-A.1.2">A.1.2</a>.  Shared-Secret Distributed Securely Out-of-Band</span>

   In this scenario, the CA distributes a shared-secret out-of-band to
   the end-entity that the end-entity uses to authenticate its
   certification request.  The end-entity signs the Full PKI Request
   with the private key for which the certification is being requested.
   The end-entity includes the Identity Proof Version 2 control to
   authenticate the request using the shared-secret.  The CA uses either
   the Identification control or the Subject in the end-entity's
   enclosed PKCS #10 or CRMF certification request message to identify
   the request.  The end-entity performs either the POP Link Witness
   Version 2 mechanism as described in <a href="rfc5272.html#section-6.3.1.1">[RFC5272], Section 6.3.1.1</a>, or
   the Shared-Subject/Subject Distinguished Name (DN) linking mechanism
   as described in <a href="rfc5272.html#section-6.3.2">[RFC5272], Section 6.3.2</a>.  The Subject in the
   enclosed PKCS #10 or CRMF certification request does not necessarily
   match the issued certificate, as it may be used just to help identify
   the request (and corresponding shared-secret) to the CA.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.1.3.%20%20RA%20Authentication"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1.3" name="appendix-A.1.3">A.1.3</a>.  RA Authentication</span>

   In this scenario, the end-entity does not automatically authenticate
   its enrollment request to the CA, either because the end-entity has
   nothing to authenticate the request with or because organizational
   policy requires RA involvement.  The end-entity creates a Full PKI
   Request and sends it to an RA.  The RA verifies the authenticity of
   the request, then, if approved, encapsulates and signs the request as
   described in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>, forwarding the new request on to the CA.
   The Subject in the PKCS #10 or CRMF certification request is not
   required to match the issued certificate, it may be used just to help
   identify the request to the RA and/or CA.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.2.%20%20Rekey"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.2" name="appendix-A.2">A.2</a>.  Rekey</span>

   There are two scenarios to support the rekey of certificates that are
   already enrolled.  One addresses the rekey of signature certificates
   and the other addresses the rekey of key establishment certificates.
   Typically, organizational policy will require certificates to be
   currently valid to be rekeyed, and it may require initial enrollment
   to be repeated when rekey is not possible.  However, some
   organizational policies might allow a grace period during which an
   expired certificate could be used to rekey.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.2.1.%20%20Rekey%20of%20Signature%20Certificates"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.2.1" name="appendix-A.2.1">A.2.1</a>.  Rekey of Signature Certificates</span>

   When a signature certificate is rekeyed, the PKCS #10 or CRMF
   certification request message enclosed in the Full PKI Request will
   include the same Subject as the current signature certificate.  The
   Full PKI Request will be signed by the current private key
   corresponding to the current signature certificate.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.2.2.%20%20Rekey%20of%20Key%20Establishment%20Certificates"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.2.2" name="appendix-A.2.2">A.2.2</a>.  Rekey of Key Establishment Certificates</span>

   When a key establishment certificate is rekeyed, the Full PKI Request
   will generally be signed by the current private key corresponding to
   the current signature certificate.  If there is no current signature
   certificate, one of the initial enrollment options in <a href="#appendix-A.1">Appendix A.1</a>
   may be used.
