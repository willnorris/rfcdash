   This document describes the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure
   (PKI) Certificate Management Protocol (CMP).  Protocol messages are
   defined for certificate creation and management.  The term
   "certificate" in this document refers to an X.509v3 Certificate as
   defined in [<a href="#ref-X509" title='"Information technology - Open Systems Interconnection - The Directory: Public-key and attribute certificate frameworks"'>X509</a>].

   This specification obsoletes <a href="rfc2510.html">RFC 2510</a>.  This specification differs
   from <a href="rfc2510.html">RFC 2510</a> in the following areas:

      The PKI management message profile section is split to two
      appendices: the required profile and the optional profile.  Some
      of the formerly mandatory functionality is moved to the optional
      profile.

      The message confirmation mechanism has changed substantially.

      A new polling mechanism is introduced, deprecating the old polling
      method at the CMP transport level.

      The CMP transport protocol issues are handled in a separate
      document [<a href="#ref-CMPtrans" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure -- Transport Protocols for CMP"'>CMPtrans</a>], thus the Transports section is removed.

      A new implicit confirmation method is introduced to reduce the
      number of protocol messages exchanged in a transaction.

      The new specification contains some less prominent protocol
      enhancements and improved explanatory text on several issues.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,
   as shown) are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   The PKI must be structured to be consistent with the types of
   individuals who must administer it.  Providing such administrators
   with unbounded choices not only complicates the software required,
   but also increases the chances that a subtle mistake by an
   administrator or software developer will result in broader
   compromise.  Similarly, restricting administrators with cumbersome
   mechanisms will cause them not to use the PKI.

   Management protocols are REQUIRED to support on-line interactions
   between Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components.  For example, a
   management protocol might be used between a Certification Authority
   (CA) and a client system with which a key pair is associated, or
   between two CAs that issue cross-certificates for each other.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20PKI%20Management%20Model"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  PKI Management Model</span>

   Before specifying particular message formats and procedures, we first
   define the entities involved in PKI management and their interactions
   (in terms of the PKI management functions required).  We then group
   these functions in order to accommodate different identifiable types
   of end entities.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.1.%20%20Definitions%20of%20PKI%20Entities"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1" name="section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>.  Definitions of PKI Entities</span>

   The entities involved in PKI management include the end entity (i.e.,
   the entity to whom the certificate is issued) and the certification
   authority (i.e., the entity that issues the certificate).  A
   registration authority MAY also be involved in PKI management.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.1.1.%20%20Subjects%20and%20End%20Entities"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.1" name="section-3.1.1.1">3.1.1.1</a>.  Subjects and End Entities</span>

   The term "subject" is used here to refer to the entity to whom the
   certificate is issued, typically named in the subject or
   subjectAltName field of a certificate.  When we wish to distinguish
   the tools and/or software used by the subject (e.g., a local
   certificate management module), we will use the term "subject
   equipment".  In general, the term "end entity" (EE), rather than
   "subject", is preferred in order to avoid confusion with the field
   name.  It is important to note that the end entities here will
   include not only human users of applications, but also applications
   themselves (e.g., for IP security).  This factor influences the
   protocols that the PKI management operations use; for example,
   application software is far more likely to know exactly which
   certificate extensions are required than are human users.  PKI
   management entities are also end entities in the sense that they are
   sometimes named in the subject or subjectAltName field of a
   certificate or cross-certificate.  Where appropriate, the term "end-
   entity" will be used to refer to end entities who are not PKI
   management entities.

   All end entities require secure local access to some information --
   at a minimum, their own name and private key, the name of a CA that
   is directly trusted by this entity, and that CA's public key (or a
   fingerprint of the public key where a self-certified version is
   available elsewhere).  Implementations MAY use secure local storage
   for more than this minimum (e.g., the end entity's own certificate or



<span class="grey">Adams, et al.               Standards Track                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

   application-specific information).  The form of storage will also
   vary -- from files to tamper-resistant cryptographic tokens.  The
   information stored in such local, trusted storage is referred to here
   as the end entity's Personal Security Environment (PSE).

   Though PSE formats are beyond the scope of this document (they are
   very dependent on equipment, et cetera), a generic interchange format
   for PSEs is defined here: a certification response message MAY be
   used.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.1.2.%20%20Certification%20Authority"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.2" name="section-3.1.1.2">3.1.1.2</a>.  Certification Authority</span>

   The certification authority (CA) may or may not actually be a real
   "third party" from the end entity's point of view.  Quite often, the
   CA will actually belong to the same organization as the end entities
   it supports.

   Again, we use the term "CA" to refer to the entity named in the
   issuer field of a certificate.  When it is necessary to distinguish
   the software or hardware tools used by the CA, we use the term "CA
   equipment".

   The CA equipment will often include both an "off-line" component and
   an "on-line" component, with the CA private key only available to the
   "off-line" component.  This is, however, a matter for implementers
   (though it is also relevant as a policy issue).

   We use the term "root CA" to indicate a CA that is directly trusted
   by an end entity; that is, securely acquiring the value of a root CA
   public key requires some out-of-band step(s).  This term is not meant
   to imply that a root CA is necessarily at the top of any hierarchy,
   simply that the CA in question is trusted directly.

   A "subordinate CA" is one that is not a root CA for the end entity in
   question.  Often, a subordinate CA will not be a root CA for any
   entity, but this is not mandatory.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.1.3.%20%20Registration%20Authority"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1.1.3" name="section-3.1.1.3">3.1.1.3</a>.  Registration Authority</span>

   In addition to end-entities and CAs, many environments call for the
   existence of a Registration Authority (RA) separate from the
   Certification Authority.  The functions that the registration
   authority may carry out will vary from case to case but MAY include
   personal authentication, token distribution, revocation reporting,

   This document views the RA as an OPTIONAL component: when it is not
   present, the CA is assumed to be able to carry out the RA's functions
   so that the PKI management protocols are the same from the end-
   entity's point of view.

   Again, we distinguish, where necessary, between the RA and the tools
   used (the "RA equipment").

   Note that an RA is itself an end entity.  We further assume that all
   RAs are in fact certified end entities and that RAs have private keys
   that are usable for signing.  How a particular CA equipment
   identifies some end entities as RAs is an implementation issue (i.e.,
   this document specifies no special RA certification operation).  We
   do not mandate that the RA is certified by the CA with which it is
   interacting at the moment (so one RA may work with more than one CA
   whilst only being certified once).

   In some circumstances, end entities will communicate directly with a
   CA even where an RA is present.  For example, for initial
   registration and/or certification, the subject may use its RA, but
   communicate directly with the CA in order to refresh its certificate.

   The protocols given here meet the following requirements on PKI
   management

   1.   PKI management must conform to the ISO/IEC 9594-8/ITU-T X.509
        standards.

   2.   It must be possible to regularly update any key pair without
        affecting any other key pair.

   3.   The use of confidentiality in PKI management protocols must be
        kept to a minimum in order to ease acceptance in environments
        where strong confidentiality might cause regulatory problems.

   4.   PKI management protocols must allow the use of different
        industry-standard cryptographic algorithms (specifically
        including RSA, DSA, MD5, and SHA-1).  This means that any given
        CA, RA, or end entity may, in principle, use whichever
        algorithms suit it for its own key pair(s).

   5.   PKI management protocols must not preclude the generation of key
        pairs by the end-entity concerned, by an RA, or by a CA.  Key
        generation may also occur elsewhere, but for the purposes of PKI
        management we can regard key generation as occurring wherever
        the key is first present at an end entity, RA, or CA.



<span class="grey">Adams, et al.               Standards Track                     [Page 8]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-9" id="page-9" name="page-9"> </a>

   6.   PKI management protocols must support the publication of
        certificates by the end-entity concerned, by an RA, or by a CA.
        Different implementations and different environments may choose
        any of the above approaches.

   7.   PKI management protocols must support the production of
        Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) by allowing certified end
        entities to make requests for the revocation of certificates.
        This must be done in such a way that the denial-of-service
        attacks, which are possible, are not made simpler.

   8.   PKI management protocols must be usable over a variety of
        "transport" mechanisms, specifically including mail, http,
        TCP/IP and ftp.

   9.   Final authority for certification creation rests with the CA.
        No RA or end-entity equipment can assume that any certificate
        issued by a CA will contain what was requested; a CA may alter
        certificate field values or may add, delete, or alter extensions
        according to its operating policy.  In other words, all PKI
        entities (end-entities, RAs, and CAs) must be capable of
        handling responses to requests for certificates in which the
        actual certificate issued is different from that requested (for
        example, a CA may shorten the validity period requested).  Note
        that policy may dictate that the CA must not publish or
        otherwise distribute the certificate until the requesting entity
        has reviewed and accepted the newly-created certificate
        (typically through use of the certConf message).

   10.  A graceful, scheduled change-over from one non-compromised CA
        key pair to the next (CA key update) must be supported (note
        that if the CA key is compromised, re-initialization must be
        performed for all entities in the domain of that CA).  An end
        entity whose PSE contains the new CA public key (following a CA
        key update) must also be able to verify certificates verifiable
        using the old public key.  End entities who directly trust the
        old CA key pair must also be able to verify certificates signed
        using the new CA private key (required for situations where the
        old CA public key is "hardwired" into the end entity's
        cryptographic equipment).

   11.  The functions of an RA may, in some implementations or
        environments, be carried out by the CA itself.  The protocols
        must be designed so that end entities will use the same protocol
        regardless of whether the communication is with an RA or CA.
        Naturally, the end entity must use the correct RA of CA public
        key to protect the communication.

   12.  Where an end entity requests a certificate containing a given
        public key value, the end entity must be ready to demonstrate
        possession of the corresponding private key value.  This may be
        accomplished in various ways, depending on the type of
        certification request.  See <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a> for details of the in-
        band methods defined for the PKIX-CMP (i.e., Certificate
        Management Protocol) messages.

   Figure 1 - PKI Entities

     At a high level, the set of operations for which management
     messages are defined can be grouped as follows.

   1.  CA establishment: When establishing a new CA, certain steps are
       required (e.g., production of initial CRLs, export of CA public
       key).

   2.  End entity initialization: this includes importing a root CA
       public key and requesting information about the options supported
       by a PKI management entity.




<span class="grey">Adams, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 11]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-12" id="page-12" name="page-12"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4210.html">RFC 4210</a>                          CMP                     September 2005</span>


   3.  Certification: various operations result in the creation of new
       certificates:

       1.  initial registration/certification: This is the process
           whereby an end entity first makes itself known to a CA or RA,
           prior to the CA issuing a certificate or certificates for
           that end entity.  The end result of this process (when it is
           successful) is that a CA issues a certificate for an end
           entity's public key, and returns that certificate to the end
           entity and/or posts that certificate in a public repository.
           This process may, and typically will, involve multiple
           "steps", possibly including an initialization of the end
           entity's equipment.  For example, the end entity's equipment
           must be securely initialized with the public key of a CA, to
           be used in validating certificate paths.  Furthermore, an end
           entity typically needs to be initialized with its own key
           pair(s).

       2.  key pair update: Every key pair needs to be updated regularly
           (i.e., replaced with a new key pair), and a new certificate
           needs to be issued.

       3.  certificate update: As certificates expire, they may be
           "refreshed" if nothing relevant in the environment has
           changed.

       4.  CA key pair update: As with end entities, CA key pairs need
           to be updated regularly; however, different mechanisms are
           required.

       5.  cross-certification request: One CA requests issuance of a
           cross-certificate from another CA.  For the purposes of this
           standard, the following terms are defined.  A "cross-
           certificate" is a certificate in which the subject CA and the
           issuer CA are distinct and SubjectPublicKeyInfo contains a
           verification key (i.e., the certificate has been issued for
           the subject CA's signing key pair).  When it is necessary to
           distinguish more finely, the following terms may be used: a
           cross-certificate is called an "inter-domain cross-
           certificate" if the subject and issuer CAs belong to
           different administrative domains; it is called an "intra-
           domain cross-certificate" otherwise.

           1.  Note 1.  The above definition of "cross-certificate"
               aligns with the defined term "CA-certificate" in X.509.
               Note that this term is not to be confused with the X.500
               "cACertificate" attribute type, which is unrelated.

<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-13" id="page-13" name="page-13"> </a>

           2.  Note 2.  In many environments, the term "cross-
               certificate", unless further qualified, will be
               understood to be synonymous with "inter-domain cross-
               certificate" as defined above.

           3.  Note 3.  Issuance of cross-certificates may be, but is
               not necessarily, mutual; that is, two CAs may issue
               cross-certificates for each other.

       6.  cross-certificate update: Similar to a normal certificate
           update, but involving a cross-certificate.

   4.  Certificate/CRL discovery operations: some PKI management
       operations result in the publication of certificates or CRLs:

       1.  certificate publication: Having gone to the trouble of
           producing a certificate, some means for publishing it is
           needed.  The "means" defined in PKIX MAY involve the messages
           specified in Sections <a href="#section-5.3.13">5.3.13</a> to <a href="#section-5.3.16">5.3.16</a>, or MAY involve other
           methods (LDAP, for example) as described in [<a href="rfc2559.html" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Operational Protocols - LDAPv2"'>RFC2559</a>],
           [<a href="rfc2585.html" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Operational Protocols: FTP and HTTP"'>RFC2585</a>] (the "Operational Protocols" documents of the PKIX
           series of specifications).

       2.  CRL publication: As for certificate publication.

   5.  Recovery operations: some PKI management operations are used when
       an end entity has "lost" its PSE:

       1.  key pair recovery: As an option, user client key materials
           (e.g., a user's private key used for decryption purposes) MAY
           be backed up by a CA, an RA, or a key backup system
           associated with a CA or RA.  If an entity needs to recover
           these backed up key materials (e.g., as a result of a
           forgotten password or a lost key chain file), a protocol
           exchange may be needed to support such recovery.

   6.  Revocation operations: some PKI operations result in the creation
       of new CRL entries and/or new CRLs:

       1.  revocation request: An authorized person advises a CA of an
           abnormal situation requiring certificate revocation.

   7.  PSE operations: whilst the definition of PSE operations (e.g.,
       moving a PSE, changing a PIN, etc.) are beyond the scope of this
       specification, we do define a PKIMessage (CertRepMessage) that
       can form the basis of such operations.





<span class="grey">Adams, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 13]</span></pre>

   Note that on-line protocols are not the only way of implementing the
   above operations.  For all operations, there are off-line methods of
   achieving the same result, and this specification does not mandate
   use of on-line protocols.  For example, when hardware tokens are
   used, many of the operations MAY be achieved as part of the physical
   token delivery.

   Later sections define a set of standard messages supporting the above
   operations.  Transport protocols for conveying these exchanges in
   different environments (file-based, on-line, E-mail, and WWW) are
   beyond the scope of this document and are specified separately.

   The first step for an end entity in dealing with PKI management
   entities is to request information about the PKI functions supported
   and to securely acquire a copy of the relevant root CA public key(s).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Initial%20Registration%2FCertification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Initial Registration/Certification</span>

   There are many schemes that can be used to achieve initial
   registration and certification of end entities.  No one method is
   suitable for all situations due to the range of policies that a CA
   may implement and the variation in the types of end entity which can
   occur.

   However, we can classify the initial registration/certification
   schemes that are supported by this specification.  Note that the word
   "initial", above, is crucial: we are dealing with the situation where
   the end entity in question has had no previous contact with the PKI.
   Where the end entity already possesses certified keys, then some
   simplifications/alternatives are possible.

   Having classified the schemes that are supported by this
   specification we can then specify some as mandatory and some as
   optional.  The goal is that the mandatory schemes cover a sufficient
   number of the cases that will arise in real use, whilst the optional
   schemes are available for special cases that arise less frequently.
   In this way, we achieve a balance between flexibility and ease of
   implementation.

   We will now describe the classification of initial
   registration/certification schemes.

   In terms of the PKI messages that are produced, we can regard the
   initiation of the initial registration/certification exchanges as
   occurring wherever the first PKI message relating to the end entity
   is produced.  Note that the real-world initiation of the
   registration/certification procedure may occur elsewhere (e.g., a
   personnel department may telephone an RA operator).

   The possible locations are at the end entity, an RA, or a CA.

   certificate may be authenticated or not.  The requirement here is to
   authenticate the origin of any messages from the end entity to the
   PKI (CA/RA).

   In this specification, such authentication is achieved by the PKI
   (CA/RA) issuing the end entity with a secret value (initial
   authentication key) and reference value (used to identify the secret
   value) via some out-of-band means.  The initial authentication key
   can then be used to protect relevant PKI messages.

   Thus, we can classify the initial registration/certification scheme
   according to whether or not the on-line end entity -&gt; PKI messages
   are authenticated or not.

   Note 1: We do not discuss the authentication of the PKI -&gt; end entity
   messages here, as this is always REQUIRED.  In any case, it can be
   achieved simply once the root-CA public key has been installed at the
   end entity's equipment or it can be based on the initial
   authentication key.

   Note 2: An initial registration/certification procedure can be secure
   where the messages from the end entity are authenticated via some
   out-of-band means (e.g., a subsequent visit).

   In this specification, "key generation" is regarded as occurring
   wherever either the public or private component of a key pair first
   occurs in a PKIMessage.  Note that this does not preclude a
   centralized key generation service; the actual key pair MAY have been

   generated elsewhere and transported to the end entity, RA, or CA
   using a (proprietary or standardized) key generation request/response
   protocol (outside the scope of this specification).

   Thus, there are three possibilities for the location of "key
   generation":  the end entity, an RA, or a CA.

   Following the creation of an initial certificate for an end entity,
   additional assurance can be gained by having the end entity
   explicitly confirm successful receipt of the message containing (or
   indicating the creation of) the certificate.  Naturally, this
   confirmation message must be protected (based on the initial
   authentication key or other means).

   This gives two further possibilities: confirmed or not.

   The criteria above allow for a large number of initial
   registration/certification schemes.  This specification mandates that
   conforming CA equipment, RA equipment, and EE equipment MUST support
   the second scheme listed below (<a href="#section-4.2.2.2">Section 4.2.2.2</a>).  Any entity MAY
   additionally support other schemes, if desired.

   In terms of the classification above, this scheme is, in some ways,
   the simplest possible, where:

   o  initiation occurs at the certifying CA;

   o  no on-line message authentication is required;

   o  "key generation" occurs at the certifying CA (see <a href="#section-4.2.1.3">Section</a>
      <a href="#section-4.2.1.3">4.2.1.3</a>);

   o  no confirmation message is required.

   In terms of message flow, this scheme means that the only message
   required is sent from the CA to the end entity.  The message must
   contain the entire PSE for the end entity.  Some out-of-band means
   must be provided to allow the end entity to authenticate the message
   received and to decrypt any encrypted values.

   In terms of the classification above, this scheme is where:

   In terms of message flow, the basic authenticated scheme is as

   In order to prevent certain attacks and to allow a CA/RA to properly
   check the validity of the binding between an end entity and a key
   pair, the PKI management operations specified here make it possible
   for an end entity to prove that it has possession of (i.e., is able
   to use) the private key corresponding to the public key for which a
   certificate is requested.  A given CA/RA is free to choose how to
   enforce POP (e.g., out-of-band procedural means versus PKIX-CMP

   in-band messages) in its certification exchanges (i.e., this may be a
   policy issue).  However, it is REQUIRED that CAs/RAs MUST enforce POP
   by some means because there are currently many non-PKIX operational
   protocols in use (various electronic mail protocols are one example)
   that do not explicitly check the binding between the end entity and
   the private key.  Until operational protocols that do verify the
   binding (for signature, encryption, and key agreement key pairs)
   exist, and are ubiquitous, this binding can only be assumed to have
   been verified by the CA/RA.  Therefore, if the binding is not
   verified by the CA/RA, certificates in the Internet Public-Key
   Infrastructure end up being somewhat less meaningful.

   POP is accomplished in different ways depending upon the type of key
   for which a certificate is requested.  If a key can be used for
   multiple purposes (e.g., an RSA key) then any appropriate method MAY

   be used (e.g., a key that may be used for signing, as well as other
   purposes, SHOULD NOT be sent to the CA/RA in order to prove
   possession).

   This specification explicitly allows for cases where an end entity
   supplies the relevant proof to an RA and the RA subsequently attests
   to the CA that the required proof has been received (and validated!).
   For example, an end entity wishing to have a signing key certified
   could send the appropriate signature to the RA, which then simply
   notifies the relevant CA that the end entity has supplied the
   required proof.  Of course, such a situation may be disallowed by
   some policies (e.g., CAs may be the only entities permitted to verify
   POP during certification).

   For signature keys, the end entity can sign a value to prove
   possession of the private key.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.2.%20%20Encryption%20Keys"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.2" name="section-4.3.2">4.3.2</a>.  Encryption Keys</span>

   For encryption keys, the end entity can provide the private key to
   the CA/RA, or can be required to decrypt a value in order to prove
   possession of the private key (see <a href="#section-5.2.8">Section 5.2.8</a>).  Decrypting a
   value can be achieved either directly or indirectly.

   The direct method is for the RA/CA to issue a random challenge to
   which an immediate response by the EE is required.

   The indirect method is to issue a certificate that is encrypted for
   the end entity (and have the end entity demonstrate its ability to
   decrypt this certificate in the confirmation message).  This allows a
   CA to issue a certificate in a form that can only be used by the
   intended end entity.

   This specification encourages use of the indirect method because it
   requires no extra messages to be sent (i.e., the proof can be
   demonstrated using the {request, response, confirmation} triple of
   messages).

   For key agreement keys, the end entity and the PKI management entity
   (i.e., CA or RA) must establish a shared secret key in order to prove
   that the end entity has possession of the private key.

   Note that this need not impose any restrictions on the keys that can
   be certified by a given CA.  In particular, for Diffie-Hellman keys
   the end entity may freely choose its algorithm parameters provided
   that the CA can generate a short-term (or one-time) key pair with the
   appropriate parameters when necessary.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20Root%20CA%20Key%20Update"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Root CA Key Update</span>

   This discussion only applies to CAs that are directly trusted by some
   end entities.  Self-signed CAs SHALL be considered as directly
   trusted CAs.  Recognizing whether a non-self-signed CA is supposed to
   be directly trusted for some end entities is a matter of CA policy
   and is thus beyond the scope of this document.

   The basis of the procedure described here is that the CA protects its
   new public key using its previous private key and vice versa.  Thus,
   when a CA updates its key pair it must generate two extra
   cACertificate attribute values if certificates are made available
   using an X.500 directory (for a total of four: OldWithOld,
   OldWithNew, NewWithOld, and NewWithNew).

   When a CA changes its key pair, those entities who have acquired the
   old CA public key via "out-of-band" means are most affected.  It is
   these end entities who will need access to the new CA public key
   protected with the old CA private key.  However, they will only
   require this for a limited period (until they have acquired the new
   CA public key via the "out-of-band" mechanism).  This will typically
   be easily achieved when these end entities' certificates expire.

   The data structure used to protect the new and old CA public keys is
   a standard certificate (which may also contain extensions).  There
   are no new data structures required.

   Note 1.  This scheme does not make use of any of the X.509 v3
   extensions as it must be able to work even for version 1
   certificates.  The presence of the KeyIdentifier extension would make
   for efficiency improvements.

   Note 2.  While the scheme could be generalized to cover cases where
   the CA updates its key pair more than once during the validity period
   of one of its end entities' certificates, this generalization seems
   of dubious value.  Not having this generalization simply means that
   the validity periods of certificates issued with the old CA key pair
   cannot exceed the end of the OldWithNew validity period.

   Note 3.  This scheme ensures that end entities will acquire the new
   CA public key, at the latest by the expiry of the last certificate
   they owned that was signed with the old CA private key (via the
   "out-of-band" means).  Certificate and/or key update operations
   occurring at other times do not necessarily require this (depending
   on the end entity's equipment).

   To change the key of the CA, the CA operator does the following:

   1.  Generate a new key pair;

   2.  Create a certificate containing the old CA public key signed with
       the new private key (the "old with new" certificate);

   3.  Create a certificate containing the new CA public key signed with
       the old private key (the "new with old" certificate);

   4.  Create a certificate containing the new CA public key signed with
       the new private key (the "new with new" certificate);

   5.  Publish these new certificates via the repository and/or other
       means (perhaps using a CAKeyUpdAnn message);

   6.  Export the new CA public key so that end entities may acquire it
       using the "out-of-band" mechanism (if required).

   The old CA private key is then no longer required.  However, the old
   CA public key will remain in use for some time.  The old CA public
   key is no longer required (other than for non-repudiation) when all
   end entities of this CA have securely acquired the new CA public key.

   The "old with new" certificate must have a validity period starting
   at the generation time of the old key pair and ending at the expiry
   date of the old public key.

   The "new with old" certificate must have a validity period starting
   at the generation time of the new key pair and ending at the time by
   which all end entities of this CA will securely possess the new CA
   public key (at the latest, the expiry date of the old public key).

   The "new with new" certificate must have a validity period starting
   at the generation time of the new key pair and ending at or before
   the time by which the CA will next update its key pair.

   Normally when verifying a signature, the verifier verifies (among
   other things) the certificate containing the public key of the

   In these cases, the verifier has a local copy of the CA public key
   that can be used to verify the certificate directly.  This is the
   same as the situation where no key change has occurred.

   Note that case 8 may arise between the time when the CA operator has
   generated the new key pair and the time when the CA operator stores
   the updated attributes in the repository.  Case 5 can only arise if

   the CA operator has issued both the signer's and verifier's
   certificates during this "gap" (the CA operator SHOULD avoid this as
   it leads to the failure cases described below)

   In case 2, the verifier must get access to the old public key of the
   CA.  The verifier does the following:

   1.  Look up the caCertificate attribute in the repository and pick
       the OldWithNew certificate (determined based on validity periods;
       note that the subject and issuer fields must match);

   2.  Verify that this is correct using the new CA key (which the
       verifier has locally);

   3.  If correct, check the signer's certificate using the old CA key.

   Case 2 will arise when the CA operator has issued the signer's
   certificate, then changed the key, and then issued the verifier's
   certificate; so it is quite a typical case.

   In case 3, the verifier must get access to the new public key of the
   CA.  The verifier does the following:

   1.  Look up the CACertificate attribute in the repository and pick
       the NewWithOld certificate (determined based on validity periods;
       note that the subject and issuer fields must match);

   2.  Verify that this is correct using the old CA key (which the
       verifier has stored locally);

   3.  If correct, check the signer's certificate using the new CA key.

   Case 3 will arise when the CA operator has issued the verifier's
   certificate, then changed the key, and then issued the signer's
   certificate; so it is also quite a typical case.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.2.4.%20%20Failure%20of%20Verification%20in%20Case%206"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.2.4" name="section-4.4.2.4">4.4.2.4</a>.  Failure of Verification in Case 6</span>

   In this case, the CA has issued the verifier's PSE, which contains
   the new key, without updating the repository attributes.  This means
   that the verifier has no means to get a trustworthy version of the
   CA's old key and so verification fails.

   Note that the failure is the CA operator's fault.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.2.5.%20%20Failure%20of%20Verification%20in%20Case%207"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.2.5" name="section-4.4.2.5">4.4.2.5</a>.  Failure of Verification in Case 7</span>

   In this case, the CA has issued the signer's certificate protected
   with the new key without updating the repository attributes.  This
   means that the verifier has no means to get a trustworthy version of
   the CA's new key and so verification fails.

   Note that the failure is again the CA operator's fault.

   As we saw above, the verification of a certificate becomes more
   complex once the CA is allowed to change its key.  This is also true
   for revocation checks as the CA may have signed the CRL using a newer
   private key than the one within the user's PSE.

   The analysis of the alternatives is the same as for certificate
   verification.

   This section contains descriptions of the data structures required
   for PKI management messages.  <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> describes constraints on
   their values and the sequence of events for each of the various PKI
   management operations.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20Overall%20PKI%20Message"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Overall PKI Message</span>

   All of the messages used in this specification for the purposes of
   PKI management use the following structure:

      PKIMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
         header           PKIHeader,
         body             PKIBody,
         protection   [0] PKIProtection OPTIONAL,
         extraCerts   [1] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF CMPCertificate
                          OPTIONAL
     }
     PKIMessages ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF PKIMessage

   The PKIHeader contains information that is common to many PKI
   messages.

   The PKIBody contains message-specific information.

   The PKIProtection, when used, contains bits that protect the PKI
   message.

   The extraCerts field can contain certificates that may be useful to
   the recipient.  For example, this can be used by a CA or RA to
   present an end entity with certificates that it needs to verify its
   own new certificate (if, for example, the CA that issued the end
   entity's certificate is not a root CA for the end entity).  Note that
   this field does not necessarily contain a certification path; the
   recipient may have to sort, select from, or otherwise process the
   extra certificates in order to use them.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.1.%20%20PKI%20Message%20Header"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.1" name="section-5.1.1">5.1.1</a>.  PKI Message Header</span>

   All PKI messages require some header information for addressing and
   transaction identification.  Some of this information will also be
   present in a transport-specific envelope.  However, if the PKI
   message is protected, then this information is also protected (i.e.,
   we make no assumption about secure transport).

   The following data structure is used to contain this information:

     PKIHeader ::= SEQUENCE {
         pvno                INTEGER     { cmp1999(1), cmp2000(2) },
         sender              GeneralName,
         recipient           GeneralName,
         messageTime     [0] GeneralizedTime         OPTIONAL,
         protectionAlg   [1] AlgorithmIdentifier     OPTIONAL,
         senderKID       [2] KeyIdentifier           OPTIONAL,
         recipKID        [3] KeyIdentifier           OPTIONAL,
         transactionID   [4] OCTET STRING            OPTIONAL,
         senderNonce     [5] OCTET STRING            OPTIONAL,
         recipNonce      [6] OCTET STRING            OPTIONAL,
         freeText        [7] PKIFreeText             OPTIONAL,
         generalInfo     [8] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                             InfoTypeAndValue     OPTIONAL
     }
     PKIFreeText ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF UTF8String

   The pvno field is fixed (at 2) for this version of this
   specification.

   The sender field contains the name of the sender of the PKIMessage.
   This name (in conjunction with senderKID, if supplied) should be
   sufficient to indicate the key to use to verify the protection on the
   message.  If nothing about the sender is known to the sending entity
   (e.g., in the init. req. message, where the end entity may not know
   its own Distinguished Name (DN), e-mail name, IP address, etc.), then
   the "sender" field MUST contain a "NULL" value; that is, the SEQUENCE
   OF relative distinguished names is of zero length.  In such a case,
   the senderKID field MUST hold an identifier (i.e., a reference
   number) that indicates to the receiver the appropriate shared secret
   information to use to verify the message.

   The recipient field contains the name of the recipient of the
   PKIMessage.  This name (in conjunction with recipKID, if supplied)
   should be usable to verify the protection on the message.

   The protectionAlg field specifies the algorithm used to protect the
   message.  If no protection bits are supplied (note that PKIProtection
   is OPTIONAL) then this field MUST be omitted; if protection bits are
   supplied, then this field MUST be supplied.

   senderKID and recipKID are usable to indicate which keys have been
   used to protect the message (recipKID will normally only be required
   where protection of the message uses Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys).

   These fields MUST be used if required to uniquely identify a key
   (e.g., if more than one key is associated with a given sender name)
   and SHOULD be omitted otherwise.

   The transactionID field within the message header is to be used to
   allow the recipient of a message to correlate this with an ongoing
   transaction.  This is needed for all transactions that consist of
   more than just a single request/response pair.  For transactions that
   consist of a single request/response pair, the rules are as follows.
   A client MAY populate the transactionID field of the request.  If a
   server receives such a request that has the transactionID field set,
   then it MUST set the transactionID field of the response to the same
   value.  If a server receives such request with a missing
   transactionID field, then it MAY set transactionID field of the
   response.

   For transactions that consist of more than just a single
   request/response pair, the rules are as follows.  Clients SHOULD
   generate a transactionID for the first request.  If a server receives
   such a request that has the transactionID field set, then it MUST set
   the transactionID field of the response to the same value.  If a
   server receives such request with a missing transactionID field, then
   it MUST populate the transactionID field of the response with a
   server-generated ID.  Subsequent requests and responses MUST all set
   the transactionID field to the thus established value.  In all cases
   where a transactionID is being used, a given client MUST NOT have
   more than one transaction with the same transactionID in progress at
   any time (to a given server).  Servers are free to require uniqueness
   of the transactionID or not, as long as they are able to correctly
   associate messages with the corresponding transaction.  Typically,
   this means that a server will require the {client, transactionID}
   tuple to be unique, or even the transactionID alone to be unique, if
   it cannot distinguish clients based on transport-level information.
   A server receiving the first message of a transaction (which requires
   more than a single request/response pair) that contains a
   transactionID that does not allow it to meet the above constraints
   (typically because the transactionID is already in use) MUST send
   back an ErrorMsgContent with a PKIFailureInfo of transactionIdInUse.
   It is RECOMMENDED that the clients fill the transactionID field with
   128 bits of (pseudo-) random data for the start of a transaction to
   reduce the probability of having the transactionID in use at the
   server.

   The senderNonce and recipNonce fields protect the PKIMessage against
   replay attacks.  The senderNonce will typically be 128 bits of
   (pseudo-) random data generated by the sender, whereas the recipNonce
   is copied from the senderNonce of the previous message in the
   transaction.

   The messageTime field contains the time at which the sender created
   the message.  This may be useful to allow end entities to
   correct/check their local time for consistency with the time on a
   central system.

   The freeText field may be used to send a human-readable message to
   the recipient (in any number of languages).  The first language used
   in this sequence indicates the desired language for replies.

   The generalInfo field may be used to send machine-processable
   additional data to the recipient.  The following generalInfo
   extensions are defined and MAY be supported.

   This is used by the EE to inform the CA that it does not wish to send
   a certificate confirmation for issued certificates.

         implicitConfirm OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-it 13}
         ImplicitConfirmValue ::= NULL

   If the CA grants the request to the EE, it MUST put the same
   extension in the PKIHeader of the response.  If the EE does not find
   the extension in the response, it MUST send the certificate
   confirmation.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.3.%20%20PKI%20Message%20Protection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.3" name="section-5.1.3">5.1.3</a>.  PKI Message Protection</span>

   Some PKI messages will be protected for integrity.  (Note that if an
   asymmetric algorithm is used to protect a message and the relevant
   public component has been certified already, then the origin of the
   message can also be authenticated.  On the other hand, if the public
   component is uncertified, then the message origin cannot be
   automatically authenticated, but may be authenticated via out-of-band
   means.)

   When protection is applied, the following structure is used:

        PKIProtection ::= BIT STRING

   The input to the calculation of PKIProtection is the DER encoding of
   the following data structure:

        ProtectedPart ::= SEQUENCE {
            header    PKIHeader,
            body      PKIBody
        }

   There MAY be cases in which the PKIProtection BIT STRING is
   deliberately not used to protect a message (i.e., this OPTIONAL field
   is omitted) because other protection, external to PKIX, will be
   applied instead.  Such a choice is explicitly allowed in this
   specification.  Examples of such external protection include PKCS #7

   [<a id="ref-PKCS7" name="ref-PKCS7">PKCS7</a>] and Security Multiparts [<a href="rfc1847.html" title='"Security Multiparts for MIME: Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted"'>RFC1847</a>] encapsulation of the
   PKIMessage (or simply the PKIBody (omitting the CHOICE tag), if the
   relevant PKIHeader information is securely carried in the external
   mechanism).  It is noted, however, that many such external mechanisms
   require that the end entity already possesses a public-key
   certificate, and/or a unique Distinguished Name, and/or other such
   infrastructure-related information.  Thus, they may not be
   appropriate for initial registration, key-recovery, or any other
   process with "boot-strapping" characteristics.  For those cases it
   may be necessary that the PKIProtection parameter be used.  In the
   future, if/when external mechanisms are modified to accommodate
   boot-strapping scenarios, the use of PKIProtection may become rare or
   non-existent.

   Depending on the circumstances, the PKIProtection bits may contain a
   Message Authentication Code (MAC) or signature.  Only the following
   cases can occur:

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.3.1.%20%20Shared%20Secret%20Information"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1.3.1" name="section-5.1.3.1">5.1.3.1</a>.  Shared Secret Information</span>

   In this case, the sender and recipient share secret information
   (established via out-of-band means or from a previous PKI management
   operation).  PKIProtection will contain a MAC value and the
   protectionAlg will be the following (see also <a href="#appendix-D.2">Appendix D.2</a>):

     id-PasswordBasedMac OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {1 2 840 113533 7 66 13}
     PBMParameter ::= SEQUENCE {
       salt                OCTET STRING,
       owf                 AlgorithmIdentifier,
       iterationCount      INTEGER,
       mac                 AlgorithmIdentifier
     }

   In the above protectionAlg, the salt value is appended to the shared
   secret input.  The OWF is then applied iterationCount times, where
   the salted secret is the input to the first iteration and, for each
   successive iteration, the input is set to be the output of the
   previous iteration.  The output of the final iteration (called
   "BASEKEY" for ease of reference, with a size of "H") is what is used
   to form the symmetric key.  If the MAC algorithm requires a K-bit key
   and K &lt;= H, then the most significant K bits of BASEKEY are used.  If
   K &gt; H, then all of BASEKEY is used for the most significant H bits of
   the key, OWF("1" || BASEKEY) is used for the next most significant H
   bits of the key, OWF("2" || BASEKEY) is used for the next most
   significant H bits of the key, and so on, until all K bits have been
   derived.  [Here "N" is the ASCII byte encoding the number N and "||"
   represents concatenation.]

   end entity must generate a symmetric key based on its private DH key
   value and the DH public key of the recipient of the PKI message.
   PKIProtection will contain a MAC value keyed with this derived
   symmetric key and the protectionAlg will be the following:

        id-DHBasedMac OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {1 2 840 113533 7 66 30}

        DHBMParameter ::= SEQUENCE {
            owf                 AlgorithmIdentifier,
            -- AlgId for a One-Way Function (SHA-1 recommended)
            mac                 AlgorithmIdentifier
            -- the MAC AlgId (e.g., DES-MAC, Triple-DES-MAC [<a href="#ref-PKCS11" title='"The Public-Key Cryptography Standards - Cryptographic Token Interface Standard. Version 2.10"'>PKCS11</a>],
        }   -- or HMAC [RFC2104, <a href="rfc2202.html">RFC2202</a>])

   In the above protectionAlg, OWF is applied to the result of the
   Diffie-Hellman computation.  The OWF output (called "BASEKEY" for
   ease of reference, with a size of "H") is what is used to form the
   symmetric key.  If the MAC algorithm requires a K-bit key and K &lt;= H,
   then the most significant K bits of BASEKEY are used.  If K &gt; H, then
   all of BASEKEY is used for the most significant H bits of the key,
   OWF("1" || BASEKEY) is used for the next most significant H bits of
   the key, OWF("2" || BASEKEY) is used for the next most significant H
   bits of the key, and so on, until all K bits have been derived.
   [Here "N" is the ASCII byte encoding the number N and "||" represents
   concatenation.]

   In this case, the sender possesses a signature key pair and simply
   signs the PKI message.  PKIProtection will contain the signature
   value and the protectionAlg will be an AlgorithmIdentifier for a
   digital signature (e.g., md5WithRSAEncryption or dsaWithSha-1).

   In cases where an end entity sends a protected PKI message to an RA,
   the RA MAY forward that message to a CA, attaching its own protection
   (which MAY be a MAC or a signature, depending on the information and
   certificates shared between the RA and the CA).  This is accomplished

   by nesting the entire message sent by the end entity within a new PKI
   message.  The structure used is as follows.

          NestedMessageContent ::= PKIMessages

   (The use of PKIMessages, a SEQUENCE OF PKIMessage, lets the RA batch
   the requests of several EEs in a single new message.  For simplicity,
   all messages in the batch MUST be of the same type (e.g., ir).)  If
   the RA wishes to modify the message(s) in some way (e.g., add
   particular field values or new extensions), then it MAY create its
   own desired PKIBody.  The original PKIMessage from the EE MAY be
   included in the generalInfo field of PKIHeader (to accommodate, for
   example, cases in which the CA wishes to check POP or other
   information on the original EE message).  The infoType to be used in
   this situation is {id-it 15} (see <a href="#section-5.3.19">Section 5.3.19</a> for the value of
   id-it) and the infoValue is PKIMessages (contents MUST be in the same
   order as the requests in PKIBody).

   Before specifying the specific types that may be placed in a PKIBody,
   we define some data structures that are used in more than one case.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.1.%20%20Requested%20Certificate%20Contents"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.1" name="section-5.2.1">5.2.1</a>.  Requested Certificate Contents</span>

   Various PKI management messages require that the originator of the
   message indicate some of the fields that are required to be present
   in a certificate.  The CertTemplate structure allows an end entity or
   RA to specify as much as it wishes about the certificate it requires.
   CertTemplate is identical to a Certificate, but with all fields
   optional.

   Note that even if the originator completely specifies the contents of
   a certificate it requires, a CA is free to modify fields within the
   certificate actually issued.  If the modified certificate is
   unacceptable to the requester, the requester MUST send back a
   certConf message that either does not include this certificate (via a
   CertHash), or does include this certificate (via a CertHash) along
   with a status of "rejected".  See <a href="#section-5.3.18">Section 5.3.18</a> for the definition
   and use of CertHash and the certConf message.

   Where encrypted values (restricted, in this specification, to be
   either private keys or certificates) are sent in PKI messages, the
   EncryptedValue data structure is used.

   See [<a href="#ref-CRMF" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)"'>CRMF</a>] for EncryptedValue syntax.

   Use of this data structure requires that the creator and intended
   recipient be able to encrypt and decrypt, respectively.  Typically,
   this will mean that the sender and recipient have, or are able to
   generate, a shared secret key.

   If the recipient of the PKIMessage already possesses a private key
   usable for decryption, then the encSymmKey field MAY contain a
   session key encrypted using the recipient's public key.

   In order to identify particular certificates, the CertId data

   Each root CA must be able to publish its current public key via some
   "out-of-band" means.  While such mechanisms are beyond the scope of
   this document, we define data structures that can support such
   mechanisms.

   There are generally two methods available: either the CA directly
   publishes its self-signed certificate, or this information is
   available via the Directory (or equivalent) and the CA publishes a
   hash of this value to allow verification of its integrity before use.

        OOBCert ::= Certificate

   The fields within this certificate are restricted as follows:

   o  The certificate MUST be self-signed (i.e., the signature must be
      verifiable using the SubjectPublicKeyInfo field);

   o  The subject and issuer fields MUST be identical;

   o  If the subject field is NULL, then both subjectAltNames and
      issuerAltNames extensions MUST be present and have exactly the
      same value;

   o  The values of all other extensions must be suitable for a self-
      signed certificate (e.g., key identifiers for subject and issuer
      must be the same).

   If the certification request is for a signing key pair (i.e., a

   of the private signing key is demonstrated through use of the
   POPOSigningKey structure.

   On the other hand, if the certification request is for an encryption
   key pair (i.e., a request for an encryption certificate), then the
   proof-of-possession of the private decryption key may be demonstrated
   in one of three ways.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.8.1.%20%20Inclusion%20of%20the%20Private%20Key"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.8.1" name="section-5.2.8.1">5.2.8.1</a>.  Inclusion of the Private Key</span>

   By the inclusion of the private key (encrypted) in the CertRequest
   (in the thisMessage field of POPOPrivKey (see <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a>) or in the
   PKIArchiveOptions control structure, depending upon whether or not
   archival of the private key is also desired).

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.8.2.%20%20Indirect%20Method"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.8.2" name="section-5.2.8.2">5.2.8.2</a>.  Indirect Method</span>

   By having the CA return not the certificate, but an encrypted
   certificate (i.e., the certificate encrypted under a randomly-
   generated symmetric key, and the symmetric key encrypted under the
   public key for which the certification request is being made) -- this
   is the "indirect" method mentioned previously in <a href="#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</a>. The
   end entity proves knowledge of the private decryption key to the CA
   by providing the correct CertHash for this certificate in the
   certConf message.  This demonstrates POP because the EE can only
   compute the correct CertHash if it is able to recover the
   certificate, and it can only recover the certificate if it is able to
   decrypt the symmetric key using the required private key.  Clearly,
   for this to work, the CA MUST NOT publish the certificate until the
   certConf message arrives (when certHash is to be used to demonstrate
   POP).  See <a href="#section-5.3.18">Section 5.3.18</a> for further details.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.8.3.%20%20Challenge-Response%20Protocol"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2.8.3" name="section-5.2.8.3">5.2.8.3</a>.  Challenge-Response Protocol</span>

   By having the end entity engage in a challenge-response protocol
   (using the messages POPODecKeyChall and POPODecKeyResp; see below)
   between CertReqMessages and CertRepMessage -- this is the "direct"
   method mentioned previously in <a href="#section-4.3.2">Section 4.3.2</a>.  (This method would
   typically be used in an environment in which an RA verifies POP and
   then makes a certification request to the CA on behalf of the end
   entity.  In such a scenario, the CA trusts the RA to have done POP
   correctly before the RA requests a certificate for the end entity.)
   The complete protocol then looks as follows (note that req' does not
   necessarily encapsulate req as a nested message):










<span class="grey">Adams, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 35]</span></pre>

                   EE            RA            CA
                    ---- req ----&gt;
                    &lt;--- chall ---
                    ---- resp ---&gt;
                                  ---- req' ---&gt;

                    ---- conf ---&gt;
                    &lt;--- ack -----

   This protocol is obviously much longer than the 3-way exchange given
   in choice (2) above, but allows a local Registration Authority to be
   involved and has the property that the certificate itself is not
   actually created until the proof-of-possession is complete.  In some
   environments, a different order of the above messages may be
   required, such as the following (this may be determined by policy):

                   EE            RA            CA
                    ---- req ----&gt;
                    &lt;--- chall ---
                    ---- resp ---&gt;
                                  ---- req' ---&gt;
                                  &lt;--- rep -----
                    &lt;--- rep -----
                    ---- conf ---&gt;
                                  ---- conf ---&gt;
                                  &lt;--- ack -----
                    &lt;--- ack -----

   If the cert. request is for a key agreement key (KAK) pair, then the
   POP can use any of the 3 ways described above for enc. key pairs,
   with the following changes: (1) the parenthetical text of bullet 2)
   is replaced with "(i.e., the certificate encrypted under the
   symmetric key derived from the CA's private KAK and the public key
   for which the certification request is being made)"; (2) the first
   parenthetical text of the challenge field of "Challenge" below is
   replaced with "(using PreferredSymmAlg (see <a href="#section-5.3.19.4">Section 5.3.19.4</a> and
   <a href="#appendix-E.5">Appendix E.5</a>) and a symmetric key derived from the CA's private KAK
   and the public key for which the certification request is being
   made)".  Alternatively, the POP can use the POPOSigningKey structure
   given in [<a href="#ref-CRMF" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)"'>CRMF</a>] (where the alg field is DHBasedMAC and the signature
   field is the MAC) as a fourth alternative for demonstrating POP if
   the CA already has a D-H certificate that is known to the EE.

   decryption key are specified as follows (see [<a href="#ref-MvOV97" title='"Handbook of Applied Cryptography"'>MvOV97</a>], p.404 for
   details).  Note that this challenge-response exchange is associated
   with the preceding cert. request message (and subsequent cert.
   response and confirmation messages) by the transactionID used in the
   PKIHeader and by the protection (MACing or signing) applied to the
   PKIMessage.

        POPODecKeyChallContent ::= SEQUENCE OF Challenge
        Challenge ::= SEQUENCE {
            owf                 AlgorithmIdentifier  OPTIONAL,

            challenge           OCTET STRING
        }

   Note that the size of Rand needs to be appropriate for encryption
   under the public key of the requester.  Given that "int" will
   typically not be longer than 64 bits, this leaves well over 100 bytes
   of room for the "sender" field when the modulus is 1024 bits.  If, in
   some environment, names are so long that they cannot fit (e.g., very
   long DNs), then whatever portion will fit should be used (as long as
   it includes at least the common name, and as long as the receiver is
   able to deal meaningfully with the abbreviation).

   The text in this section provides several options with respect to POP
   techniques.  Using "SK" for "signing key", "EK" for "encryption key",
   and "KAK" for "key agreement key", the techniques may be summarized
   as follows:

         RAVerified;
         SKPOP;
         EKPOPThisMessage;
         KAKPOPThisMessage;
         KAKPOPThisMessageDHMAC;
         EKPOPEncryptedCert;
         KAKPOPEncryptedCert;
         EKPOPChallengeResp; and
         KAKPOPChallengeResp.

   Given this array of options, it is natural to ask how an end entity
   can know what is supported by the CA/RA (i.e., which options it may
   use when requesting certificates).  The following guidelines should
   clarify this situation for EE implementers.




<span class="grey">Adams, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 37]</span></pre>

   RAVerified.  This is not an EE decision; the RA uses this if and only
   if it has verified POP before forwarding the request on to the CA, so
   it is not possible for the EE to choose this technique.

   SKPOP.  If the EE has a signing key pair, this is the only POP method
   specified for use in the request for a corresponding certificate.

   EKPOPThisMessage and KAKPOPThisMessage.  Whether or not to give up
   its private key to the CA/RA is an EE decision.  If the EE decides to
   reveal its key, then these are the only POP methods available in this
   specification to achieve this (and the key pair type will determine
   which of these two methods to use).

   KAKPOPThisMessageDHMAC.  The EE can only use this method if (1) the
   CA has a DH certificate available for this purpose, and (2) the EE
   already has a copy of this certificate.  If both these conditions
   hold, then this technique is clearly supported and may be used by the
   EE, if desired.

   EKPOPEncryptedCert, KAKPOPEncryptedCert, EKPOPChallengeResp,
   KAKPOPChallengeResp.  The EE picks one of these (in the
   subsequentMessage field) in the request message, depending upon
   preference and key pair type.  The EE is not doing POP at this point;
   it is simply indicating which method it wants to use.  Therefore, if
   the CA/RA replies with a "badPOP" error, the EE can re-request using
   the other POP method chosen in subsequentMessage.  Note, however,
   that this specification encourages the use of the EncryptedCert
   choice and, furthermore, says that the challenge-response would
   typically be used when an RA is involved and doing POP verification.
   Thus, the EE should be able to make an intelligent decision regarding
   which of these POP methods to choose in the request message.

   An Initialization response message contains as the PKIBody an

   requested a PKIStatusInfo field, a subject certificate, and possibly
   a private key (normally encrypted with a session key, which is itself
   encrypted with the protocolEncrKey).

   See <a href="#section-5.3.4">Section 5.3.4</a> for CertRepMessage syntax.  Note that if the PKI
   Message Protection is "shared secret information" (see <a href="#section-5.1.3">Section</a>

   A Certification request message contains as the PKIBody a
   CertReqMessages data structure, which specifies the requested
   certificates.  This message is intended to be used for existing PKI
   entities who wish to obtain additional certificates.

   See <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a> and [<a href="#ref-CRMF" title='"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)"'>CRMF</a>] for CertReqMessages syntax.

   Alternatively, the PKIBody MAY be a CertificationRequest (this
   structure is fully specified by the ASN.1 structure
   CertificationRequest given in [<a href="#ref-PKCS10" title='"The Public-Key Cryptography Standards - Certification Request Syntax Standard, Version 1.7"'>PKCS10</a>]).  This structure may be
   required for certificate requests for signing key pairs when

   A Certification response message contains as the PKIBody a

   Only one of the failInfo (in PKIStatusInfo) and certificate (in
   CertifiedKeyPair) fields can be present in each CertResponse
   (depending on the status).  For some status values (e.g., waiting),
   neither of the optional fields will be present.

   Given an EncryptedCert and the relevant decryption key, the
   certificate may be obtained.  The purpose of this is to allow a CA to
   return the value of a certificate, but with the constraint that only
   the intended recipient can obtain the actual certificate.  The
   benefit of this approach is that a CA may reply with a certificate
   even in the absence of a proof that the requester is the end entity
   that can use the relevant private key (note that the proof is not
   obtained until the certConf message is received by the CA).  Thus,
   the CA will not have to revoke that certificate in the event that
   something goes wrong with the proof-of-possession (but MAY do so
   anyway, depending upon policy).

   For key update requests the CertReqMessages syntax is used.
   Typically, SubjectPublicKeyInfo, KeyId, and Validity are the template
   fields that may be supplied for each key to be updated.  This message
   is intended to be used to request updates to existing (non-revoked
   and non-expired) certificates (therefore, it is sometimes referred to
   as a "Certificate Update" operation).  An update is a replacement
   certificate containing either a new subject public key or the current
   subject public key (although the latter practice may not be
   appropriate for some environments).

   This structure MAY be used to announce the existence of certificates.

   Note that this message is intended to be used for those cases (if

   A CA MAY use such an announcement to warn (or notify) a subject that
   its certificate is about to be (or has been) revoked.  This would
   typically be used where the request for revocation did not come from
   the subject concerned.

   The willBeRevokedAt field contains the time at which a new entry will

   Use of this message for certificate confirmation is NOT RECOMMENDED;
   certConf SHOULD be used instead.  Upon receiving a PKIConfirm for a
   certificate response, the recipient MAY treat it as a certConf with
   all certificates being accepted.

   This data structure is used by the client to send a confirmation to

   For any particular CertStatus, omission of the statusInfo field
   indicates ACCEPTANCE of the specified certificate.  Alternatively,
   explicit status details (with respect to acceptance or rejection) MAY
   be provided in the statusInfo field, perhaps for auditing purposes at
   the CA/RA.

   Within CertConfirmContent, omission of a CertStatus structure

   message indicates REJECTION of the certificate.  Thus, an empty

   rejection of all supplied certificates.  See <a href="#section-5.2.8">Section 5.2.8</a>, item (2),
   for a discussion of the certHash field with respect to proof-of-
   possession.

   If protection is desired on the message, the client MUST protect it

   This pair of messages is intended to handle scenarios in which the
   client needs to poll the server in order to determine the status of
   an outstanding ir, cr, or kur transaction (i.e., when the "waiting"
   PKIStatus has been received).

    PollReqContent ::= SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
        certReqId    INTEGER }

    PollRepContent ::= SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
        certReqId    INTEGER,
        checkAfter   INTEGER,  -- time in seconds
        reason       PKIFreeText OPTIONAL }

   The following clauses describe when polling messages are used, and
   how they are used.  It is assumed that multiple certConf messages can
   be sent during transactions.  There will be one sent in response to
   each ip, cp, or kup that contains a CertStatus for an issued
   certificate.

   1.  In response to an ip, cp, or kup message, an EE will send a
       certConf for all issued certificates and, following the ack, a
       pollReq for all pending certificates.

   2.  In response to a pollReq, a CA/RA will return an ip, cp, or kup
       if one or more of the pending certificates is ready; otherwise,
       it will return a pollRep.

   3.  If the EE receives a pollRep, it will wait for at least as long
       as the checkAfter value before sending another pollReq.

   4.  If an ip, cp, or kup is received in response to a pollReq, then
       it will be treated in the same way as the initial response.

   This section deals with functions that are "mandatory" in the sense
   that all end entity and CA/RA implementations MUST be able to provide
   the functionality described.  This part is effectively the profile of
   the PKI management functionality that MUST be supported.  Note,
   however, that the management functions described in this section do
   not need to be accomplished using the PKI messages defined in <a href="#section-5">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-5">5</a> if alternate means are suitable for a given environment (see
   <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a> for profiles of the PKIMessages that MUST be supported).

   [See <a href="#section-3.1.1.2">Section 3.1.1.2</a> for this document's definition of "root CA".]

   A newly created root CA must produce a "self-certificate", which is a
   Certificate structure with the profile defined for the "newWithNew"
   certificate issued following a root CA key update.

   In order to make the CA's self certificate useful to end entities
   that do not acquire the self certificate via "out-of-band" means, the
   CA must also produce a fingerprint for its certificate.  End entities
   that acquire this fingerprint securely via some "out-of-band" means
   can then verify the CA's self-certificate and, hence, the other
   attributes contained therein.

   The data structure used to carry the fingerprint is the OOBCertHash.

   CA keys (as all other keys) have a finite lifetime and will have to
   be updated on a periodic basis.  The certificates NewWithNew,
   NewWithOld, and OldWithNew (see <a href="#section-4.4.1">Section 4.4.1</a>) MAY be issued by the
   CA to aid existing end entities who hold the current self-signed CA
   certificate (OldWithOld) to transition securely to the new self-
   signed CA certificate (NewWithNew), and to aid new end entities who
   will hold NewWithNew to acquire OldWithOld securely for verification
   of existing data.

   From the perspective of PKI management protocols, the initialization
   of a subordinate CA is the same as the initialization of an end
   entity.  The only difference is that the subordinate CA must also
   produce an initial revocation list.

   Before issuing any certificates, a newly established CA (which issues
   CRLs) must produce "empty" versions of each CRL which are to be
   periodically produced.

   When a PKI entity (CA, RA, or EE) wishes to acquire information about
   the current status of a CA, it MAY send that CA a request for such
   information.

   The CA MUST respond to the request by providing (at least) all of the
   information requested by the requester.  If some of the information
   cannot be provided, then an error must be conveyed to the requester.

   If PKIMessages are used to request and supply this PKI information,
   then the request MUST be the GenMsg message, the response MUST be the
   GenRep message, and the error MUST be the Error message.  These
   messages are protected using a MAC based on shared secret information
   (i.e., PasswordBasedMAC) or using any other authenticated means (if
   the end entity has an existing certificate).

   The requester CA is the CA that will become the subject of the
   cross-certificate; the responder CA will become the issuer of the
   cross-certificate.

   The requester CA must be "up and running" before initiating the
   cross-certification operation.

   The cross-certification scheme is essentially a one way operation;
   that is, when successful, this operation results in the creation of
   one new cross-certificate.  If the requirement is that cross-
   certificates be created in "both directions", then each CA, in turn,
   must initiate a cross-certification operation (or use another
   scheme).

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4210.html">RFC 4210</a>                          CMP                     September 2005</span>


   This scheme is suitable where the two CAs in question can already
   verify each other's signatures (they have some common points of
   trust) or where there is an out-of-band verification of the origin of
   the certification request.

   Detailed Description:

   Cross certification is initiated at one CA known as the responder.
   The CA administrator for the responder identifies the CA it wants to
   cross certify and the responder CA equipment generates an
   authorization code.  The responder CA administrator passes this
   authorization code by out-of-band means to the requester CA
   administrator.  The requester CA administrator enters the
   authorization code at the requester CA in order to initiate the on-
   line exchange.

   The authorization code is used for authentication and integrity
   purposes.  This is done by generating a symmetric key based on the
   authorization code and using the symmetric key for generating Message
   Authentication Codes (MACs) on all messages exchanged.
   (Authentication may alternatively be done using signatures instead of
   MACs, if the CAs are able to retrieve and validate the required
   public keys by some means, such as an out-of-band hash comparison.)

   The requester CA initiates the exchange by generating a cross-
   certification request (ccr) with a fresh random number (requester
   random number).  The requester CA then sends the ccr message to the
   responder CA.  The fields in this message are protected from
   modification with a MAC based on the authorization code.

   Upon receipt of the ccr message, the responder CA validates the
   message and the MAC, saves the requester random number, and generates
   its own random number (responder random number).  It then generates
   (and archives, if desired) a new requester certificate that contains
   the requester CA public key and is signed with the responder CA
   signature private key.  The responder CA responds with the cross
   certification response (ccp) message.  The fields in this message are
   protected from modification with a MAC based on the authorization
   code.

   Upon receipt of the ccp message, the requester CA validates the
   message (including the received random numbers) and the MAC.  The
   requester CA responds with the certConf message.  The fields in this
   message are protected from modification with a MAC based on the
   authorization code.  The requester CA MAY write the requester
   certificate to the Repository as an aid to later certificate path
   construction.

   Upon receipt of the certConf message, the responder CA validates the
   message and the MAC, and sends back an acknowledgement using the
   PKIConfirm message.  It MAY also publish the requester certificate as
   an aid to later path construction.

   Notes:

   1.  The ccr message must contain a "complete" certification request;
       that is, all fields except the serial number (including, e.g., a
       BasicConstraints extension) must be specified by the requester
       CA.

   2.  The ccp message SHOULD contain the verification certificate of
       the responder CA; if present, the requester CA must then verify
       this certificate (for example, via the "out-of-band" mechanism).

   (A simpler, non-interactive model of cross-certification may also be
   envisioned, in which the issuing CA acquires the subject CA's public
   key from some repository, verifies it via some out-of-band mechanism,
   and creates and publishes the cross-certificate without the subject
   CA's explicit involvement.  This model may be perfectly legitimate
   for many environments, but since it does not require any protocol
   message exchanges, its detailed description is outside the scope of
   this specification.)

   As with CAs, end entities must be initialized.  Initialization of end
   entities requires at least two steps:

   o  acquisition of PKI information

   o  out-of-band verification of one root-CA public key

   (other possible steps include the retrieval of trust condition
   information and/or out-of-band verification of other CA public keys).

   The information REQUIRED is:

   o  the current root-CA public key

   o  (if the certifying CA is not a root-CA) the certification path
      from the root CA to the certifying CA together with appropriate
      revocation lists

   o  the algorithms and algorithm parameters that the certifying CA
      supports for each relevant usage

   Additional information could be required (e.g., supported extensions
   or CA policy information) in order to produce a certification request
   that will be successful.  However, for simplicity we do not mandate
   that the end entity acquires this information via the PKI messages.
   The end result is simply that some certification requests may fail
   (e.g., if the end entity wants to generate its own encryption key,
   but the CA doesn't allow that).

   The required information MAY be acquired as described in <a href="#section-6.5">Section 6.5</a>.

   An end entity must securely possess the public key of its root CA.
   One method to achieve this is to provide the end entity with the CA's
   self-certificate fingerprint via some secure "out-of-band" means.
   The end entity can then securely use the CA's self-certificate.

   See <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a> for further details.

   An initialized end entity MAY request an additional certificate at
   any time (for any purpose).  This request will be made using the
   certification request (cr) message.  If the end entity already
   possesses a signing key pair (with a corresponding verification
   certificate), then this cr message will typically be protected by the
   entity's digital signature.  The CA returns the new certificate (if
   the request is successful) in a CertRepMessage.

   When a key pair is due to expire, the relevant end entity MAY request
   a key update; that is, it MAY request that the CA issue a new
   certificate for a new key pair (or, in certain circumstances, a new
   certificate for the same key pair).  The request is made using a key
   update request (kur) message (referred to, in some environments, as a
   "Certificate Update" operation).  If the end entity already possesses
   a signing key pair (with a corresponding verification certificate),
   then this message will typically be protected by the entity's digital
   signature.  The CA returns the new certificate (if the request is
   successful) in a key update response (kup) message, which is
   syntactically identical to a CertRepMessage.

   This section defines the version negotiation used to support older
   protocols between client and servers.

   If a client knows the protocol version(s) supported by the server
   (e.g., from a previous PKIMessage exchange or via some out-of-band
   means), then it MUST send a PKIMessage with the highest version
   supported by both it and the server.  If a client does not know what
   version(s) the server supports, then it MUST send a PKIMessage using
   the highest version it supports.

   If a server receives a message with a version that it supports, then
   the version of the response message MUST be the same as the received
   version.  If a server receives a message with a version higher or
   lower than it supports, then it MUST send back an ErrorMsg with the
   unsupportedVersion bit set (in the failureInfo field of the
   pKIStatusInfo).  If the received version is higher than the highest
   supported version, then the version in the error message MUST be the
   highest version the server supports; if the received version is lower
   than the lowest supported version then the version in the error
   message MUST be the lowest version the server supports.

   If a client gets back an ErrorMsgContent with the unsupportedVersion
   bit set and a version it supports, then it MAY retry the request with
   that version.

   <a href="rfc2510.html">RFC 2510</a> did not specify the behaviour of implementations receiving

   If, after sending a cmp2000 message, a client receives an

   If a client receives a non-error PKIMessage with a version of
   cmp1999, then it MAY decide to continue the transaction (if the
   transaction hasn't finished) using <a href="rfc2510.html">RFC 2510</a> semantics.  If it does

   Some cryptographic considerations are worth explicitly spelling out.
   In the protocols specified above, when an end entity is required to
   prove possession of a decryption key, it is effectively challenged to
   decrypt something (its own certificate).  This scheme (and many
   others!) could be vulnerable to an attack if the possessor of the
   decryption key in question could be fooled into decrypting an
   arbitrary challenge and returning the cleartext to an attacker.
   Although in this specification a number of other failures in security
   are required in order for this attack to succeed, it is conceivable
   that some future services (e.g., notary, trusted time) could
   potentially be vulnerable to such attacks.  For this reason, we re-
   iterate the general rule that implementations should be very careful
   about decrypting arbitrary "ciphertext" and revealing recovered
   "plaintext" since such a practice can lead to serious security
   vulnerabilities.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.2.%20%20Proof-Of-Possession%20by%20Exposing%20the%20Private%20Key"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" name="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Proof-Of-Possession by Exposing the Private Key</span>

   Note also that exposing a private key to the CA/RA as a proof-of-
   possession technique can carry some security risks (depending upon
   whether or not the CA/RA can be trusted to handle such material
   appropriately).  Implementers are advised to:

      Exercise caution in selecting and using this particular POP
      mechanism

      When appropriate, have the user of the application explicitly
      state that they are willing to trust the CA/RA to have a copy of
      their private key before proceeding to reveal the private key.

   A small subgroup attack during a Diffie-Hellman key exchange may be
   carried out as follows.  A malicious end entity may deliberately
   choose D-H parameters that enable him/her to derive (a significant
   number of bits of) the D-H private key of the CA during a key
   archival or key recovery operation.  Armed with this knowledge, the

   EE would then be able to retrieve the decryption private key of
   another unsuspecting end entity, EE2, during EE2's legitimate key
   archival or key recovery operation with that CA.  In order to avoid
   the possibility of such an attack, two courses of action are
   available.  (1) The CA may generate a fresh D-H key pair to be used
   as a protocol encryption key pair for each EE with which it

   interacts.  (2) The CA may enter into a key validation protocol (not
   specified in this document) with each requesting end entity to ensure
   that the EE's protocol encryption key pair will not facilitate this
   attack.  Option (1) is clearly simpler (requiring no extra protocol
   exchanges from either party) and is therefore RECOMMENDED.

   The PKI General Message types are identified by object identifiers
   (OIDs).  The OIDs for the PKI General Message types defined in this
   document were assigned from an arc delegated by the IANA to the PKIX
   Working Group.

   The cryptographic algorithms referred to in this document are
   identified by object identifiers (OIDs).  The OIDs for cryptographic
   algorithms were assigned from several arcs owned by various
   organizations, including RSA Security, Entrust Technologies, IANA and
   IETF.

   Should additional encryption algorithms be introduced, the advocates
   for such algorithms are expected to assign the necessary OIDs from
   their own arcs.

   No further action by the IANA is necessary for this document or any
   anticipated updates.

   The reasons that justify the presence of an RA can be split into
   those that are due to technical factors and those which are
   organizational in nature.  Technical reasons include the following.

   o  If hardware tokens are in use, then not all end entities will have
      the equipment needed to initialize these; the RA equipment can
      include the necessary functionality (this may also be a matter of
      policy).

   o  Some end entities may not have the capability to publish
      certificates; again, the RA may be suitably placed for this.

   o  The RA will be able to issue signed revocation requests on behalf
      of end entities associated with it, whereas the end entity may not
      be able to do this (if the key pair is completely lost).

   Some of the organizational reasons that argue for the presence of an
   RA are the following.

   o  It may be more cost effective to concentrate functionality in the
      RA equipment than to supply functionality to all end entities
      (especially if special token initialization equipment is to be
      used).

   o  Establishing RAs within an organization can reduce the number of
      CAs required, which is sometimes desirable.

   o  RAs may be better placed to identify people with their
      "electronic" names, especially if the CA is physically remote from
      the end entity.

   o  For many applications, there will already be in place some
      administrative structure so that candidates for the role of RA are
      easy to find (which may not be true of the CA).

   A revocation request must incorporate suitable security mechanisms,
   including proper authentication, in order to reduce the probability
   of successful denial-of-service attacks.  A digital signature on the
   request -- MANDATORY to support within this specification if
   revocation requests are supported -- can provide the authentication
   required, but there are circumstances under which an alternative
   mechanism may be desirable (e.g., when the private key is no longer
   accessible and the entity wishes to request a revocation prior to
   re-certification of another key pair).  In order to accommodate such



<span class="grey">Adams, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 61]</span></pre>

   circumstances, a PasswordBasedMAC on the request is also MANDATORY to
   support within this specification (subject to local security policy
   for a given environment) if revocation requests are supported and if
   shared secret information can be established between the requester
   and the responder prior to the need for revocation.

   A mechanism that has seen use in some environments is "revocation
   passphrase", in which a value of sufficient entropy (i.e., a
   relatively long passphrase rather than a short password) is shared
   between (only) the entity and the CA/RA at some point prior to
   revocation; this value is later used to authenticate the revocation
   request.

   In this specification, the following technique to establish shared
   secret information (i.e., a revocation passphrase) is OPTIONAL to
   support.  Its precise use in CMP messages is as follows.

   o  The OID and value specified in <a href="#section-5.3.19.9">Section 5.3.19.9</a> MAY be sent in a
      GenMsg message at any time, or MAY be sent in the generalInfo
      field of the PKIHeader of any PKIMessage at any time.  (In
      particular, the EncryptedValue may be sent in the header of the
      certConf message that confirms acceptance of certificates
      requested in an initialization request or certificate request
      message.)  This conveys a revocation passphrase chosen by the
      entity (i.e., the decrypted bytes of the encValue field) to the
      relevant CA/RA; furthermore, the transfer is accomplished with
      appropriate confidentiality characteristics (because the
      passphrase is encrypted under the CA/RA's protocolEncryptionKey).

   o  If a CA/RA receives the revocation passphrase (OID and value
      specified in <a href="#section-5.3.19.9">Section 5.3.19.9</a>) in a GenMsg, it MUST construct and
      send a GenRep message that includes the OID (with absent value)
      specified in <a href="#section-5.3.19.9">Section 5.3.19.9</a>. If the CA/RA receives the
      revocation passphrase in the generalInfo field of a PKIHeader of
      any PKIMessage, it MUST include the OID (with absent value) in the
      generalInfo field of the PKIHeader of the corresponding response
      PKIMessage.  If the CA/RA is unable to return the appropriate
      response message for any reason, it MUST send an error message
      with a status of "rejection" and, optionally, a failInfo reason
      set.

   o  The valueHint field of EncryptedValue MAY contain a key identifier
      (chosen by the entity, along with the passphrase itself) to assist
      in later retrieval of the correct passphrase (e.g., when the
      revocation request is constructed by the entity and received by
      the CA/RA).





<span class="grey">Adams, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 62]</span></pre>

   o  The revocation request message is protected by a PasswordBasedMAC,
      with the revocation passphrase as the key.  If appropriate, the
      senderKID field in the PKIHeader MAY contain the value previously
      transmitted in valueHint.

   Using the technique specified above, the revocation passphrase may be
   initially established and updated at any time without requiring extra
   messages or out-of-band exchanges.  For example, the revocation
   request message itself (protected and authenticated through a MAC
   that uses the revocation passphrase as a key) may contain, in the
   PKIHeader, a new revocation passphrase to be used for authenticating
   future revocation requests for any of the entity's other
   certificates.  In some environments this may be preferable to
   mechanisms that reveal the passphrase in the revocation request
   message, since this can allow a denial-of-service attack in which the
   revealed passphrase is used by an unauthorized third party to
   authenticate revocation requests on the entity's other certificates.
   However, because the passphrase is not revealed in the request
   message, there is no requirement that the passphrase must always be
   updated when a revocation request is made (that is, the same
   passphrase MAY be used by an entity to authenticate revocation
   requests for different certificates at different times).

   Furthermore, the above technique can provide strong cryptographic
   protection over the entire revocation request message even when a
   digital signature is not used.  Techniques that do authentication of
   the revocation request by simply revealing the revocation passphrase
   typically do not provide cryptographic protection over the fields of
   the request message (so that a request for revocation of one
   certificate may be modified by an unauthorized third party to a
   request for revocation of another certificate for that entity).

   This appendix contains detailed profiles for those PKIMessages that
   MUST be supported by conforming implementations (see <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>).

   Profiles for the PKIMessages used in the following PKI management
   operations are provided:

   o  initial registration/certification

   o  basic authenticated scheme

   o  certificate request

   o  key update

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/D.1.%20%20General%20Rules%20for%20Interpretation%20of%20These%20Profiles."></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-D.1" name="appendix-D.1">D.1</a>.  General Rules for Interpretation of These Profiles.</span>

   1.  Where OPTIONAL or DEFAULT fields are not mentioned in individual
       profiles, they SHOULD be absent from the relevant message (i.e.,
       a receiver can validly reject a message containing such fields as
       being syntactically incorrect).  Mandatory fields are not
       mentioned if they have an obvious value (e.g., in this version of
       the specification, pvno is always 2).

   2.  Where structures occur in more than one message, they are
       separately profiled as appropriate.

   3.  The algorithmIdentifiers from PKIMessage structures are profiled
       separately.

   4.  A "special" X.500 DN is called the "NULL-DN"; this means a DN
       containing a zero-length SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedNames
       (its DER encoding is then '3000'H).

   5.  Where a GeneralName is required for a field, but no suitable
       value is available (e.g., an end entity produces a request before
       knowing its name), then the GeneralName is to be an X.500 NULL-DN
       (i.e., the Name field of the CHOICE is to contain a NULL-DN).
       This special value can be called a "NULL-GeneralName".

   6.  Where a profile omits to specify the value for a GeneralName,
       then the NULL-GeneralName value is to be present in the relevant
       PKIMessage field.  This occurs with the sender field of the
       PKIHeader for some messages.

   7.  Where any ambiguity arises due to naming of fields, the profile
       names these using a "dot" notation (e.g., "certTemplate.subject"
       means the subject field within a field called certTemplate).

   8.  Where a "SEQUENCE OF types" is part of a message, a zero-based
       array notation is used to describe fields within the SEQUENCE OF
       (e.g., crm[0].certReq.certTemplate.subject refers to a subfield
       of the first CertReqMsg contained in a request message).

   9.  All PKI message exchanges in <a href="#appendix-D.4">Appendix D.4</a> to D.6 require a
       certConf message to be sent by the initiating entity and a
       PKIConfirm to be sent by the responding entity.  The PKIConfirm
       is not included in some of the profiles given since its body is
       NULL and its header contents are clear from the context.  Any
       authenticated means can be used for the protectionAlg (e.g.,
       password-based MAC, if shared secret information is known, or
       signature).

   Proof-of-possession of a private decryption key that corresponds to a
   public encryption key for which a certificate has been requested does
   not use this profile; the CertHash field of the certConf message is
   used instead.

   Not every CA/RA will do Proof-of-Possession (of signing key,
   decryption key, or key agreement key) in the PKIX-CMP in-band
   certification request protocol (how POP is done MAY ultimately be a
   policy issue that is made explicit for any given CA in its publicized
   Policy OID and Certification Practice Statement).  However, this
   specification MANDATES that CA/RA entities MUST do POP (by some
   means) as part of the certification process.  All end entities MUST
   be prepared to provide POP (i.e., these components of the PKIX-CMP
   protocol MUST be supported).

Initial Registration/Certification (Basic Authenticated Scheme)</span>

   An (uninitialized) end entity requests a (first) certificate from a
   CA.  When the CA responds with a message containing a certificate,
   the end entity replies with a certificate confirmation.  The CA sends
   a PKIConfirm back, closing the transaction.  All messages are
   authenticated.

   This scheme allows the end entity to request certification of a
   locally-generated public key (typically a signature key).  The end
   entity MAY also choose to request the centralized generation and
   certification of another key pair (typically an encryption key pair).

   Certification may only be requested for one locally generated public
   key (for more, use separate PKIMessages).

   The end entity MUST support proof-of-possession of the private key
   associated with the locally-generated public key.

   Preconditions:

   1.  The end entity can authenticate the CA's signature based on out-
       of-band means

   2.  The end entity and the CA share a symmetric MACing key

   Message flow:

    Step# End entity                           PKI
      1   format ir
      2                      -&gt;   ir      -&gt;

      4                                        format ip
      5                      &lt;-   ip      &lt;-
      6   handle ip
      7   format certConf
      8                      -&gt;   certConf -&gt;
      9                                        handle certConf
     10                                        format PKIConf
     11                      &lt;-   PKIConf  &lt;-
     12   handle PKIConf

   For this profile, we mandate that the end entity MUST include all
   (i.e., one or two) CertReqMsg in a single PKIMessage, and that the
   PKI (CA) MUST produce a single response PKIMessage that contains the
   complete response (i.e., including the OPTIONAL second key pair, if
   it was requested and if centralized key generation is supported).
   For simplicity, we also mandate that this message MUST be the final
   one (i.e., no use of "waiting" status value).

   The end entity has an out-of-band interaction with the CA/RA.  This
   transaction established the shared secret, the referenceNumber and
   OPTIONALLY the distinguished name used for both sender and subject
   name in the certificate template.  It is RECOMMENDED that the shared
   secret be at least 12 characters long.

   An (initialized) end entity requests a certificate from a CA (to
   update the key pair and/or corresponding certificate that it already
   possesses).  When the CA responds with a message containing a
   certificate, the end entity replies with a certificate confirmation.

   Profile of how a Certificate structure may be "self-signed".  These
   structures are used for distribution of CA public keys.  This can
   occur in one of three ways (see <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a> above for a description
   of the use of these structures):

   Type          Function
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   newWithNew a true "self-signed" certificate; the contained
              public key MUST be usable to verify the signature
              (though this provides only integrity and no
              authentication whatsoever)
   oldWithNew previous root CA public key signed with new private key
   newWithOld new root CA public key signed with previous private key

   Such certificates (including relevant extensions) must contain
   "sensible" values for all fields.  For example, when present,
   subjectAltName MUST be identical to issuerAltName, and, when present,
   keyIdentifiers must contain appropriate values, et cetera.

   mechanism) to the relevant end entities.  A confirmation message is
   NOT REQUIRED from the end entities.

   The end entity sends a general message to the PKI requesting details
   that will be required for later PKI management operations.  RA/CA
   responds with a general response.  If an RA generates the response,
   then it will simply forward the equivalent message that it previously
   received from the CA, with the possible addition of certificates to
   the extraCerts fields of the PKIMessage.  A confirmation message is
   NOT REQUIRED from the end entity.

   Creation of a single cross-certificate (i.e., not two at once).  The
   requesting CA MAY choose who is responsible for publication of the
   cross-certificate created by the responding CA through use of the
   PKIPublicationInfo control.

   Preconditions:

   1.  Responding CA can verify the origin of the request (possibly
       requiring out-of-band means) before processing the request.

   2.  Requesting CA can authenticate the authenticity of the origin of
       the response (possibly requiring out-of-band means) before
       processing the response

   The use of certificate confirmation and the corresponding server
   confirmation is determined by the generalInfo field in the PKIHeader
   (see <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a>).  The following profile does not mandate support

   An (uninitialized) end entity wishes to initialize into the PKI with
   a CA, CA-1.  It uses, for authentication purposes, a pre-existing
   identity certificate issued by another (external) CA, CA-X.  A trust
   relationship must already have been established between CA-1 and CA-X
   so that CA-1 can validate the EE identity certificate signed by CA-X.
   Furthermore, some mechanism must already have been established within
   the Personal Security Environment (PSE) of the EE that would allow it
   to authenticate and verify PKIMessages signed by CA-1 (as one
   example, the PSE may contain a certificate issued for the public key
   of CA-1, signed by another CA that the EE trusts on the basis of
   out-of-band authentication techniques).

   The EE sends an initialization request to start the transaction.
   When CA-1 responds with a message containing the new certificate, the
   end entity replies with a certificate confirmation.  CA-1 replies
   with a PKIConfirm to close the transaction.  All messages are signed
   (the EE messages are signed using the private key that corresponds to

   o  the EE and CA-1 do not share a symmetric MACing key (i.e., there

      entities);

   o  sender name in ir MUST be present (and identical to the subject

   o  protectionAlg of MSG_SIG_ALG MUST be used in all messages;

   o  external identity cert.  MUST be carried in ir extraCerts field

   o  senderKID and recipKID are not used;
