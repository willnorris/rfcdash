   The EPON standard, as defined in [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004. Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for subscriber access networks."'>802.3ah</a>], defines the physical
   media (Layer 1) and media access (Layer 2) of the EPON interface.
   The EPON is a variant of the Gigabit Ethernet protocol for the
   Optical Access.  The Optical Access topology is based on passive
   optical splitting topology.  The link of a Passive Optical Network
   (PON) is based on a single, shared optical fiber with passive optical
   splitters dividing the single fiber into separate subscribers.

   The Optical Line Terminal (OLT) is the server unit of the network,
   located at the Central Office (CO).

   The Optical Network Unit (ONU) is the client unit of the network,
   located at the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).

   and 36.  The Ethernet MAC is working in gigabit rate.  The media
   interface to the MAC is through the GMII interface, as described in
   clause 35, and the PCS layer is based on the gigabit Ethernet PCS as
   described in clause 36.  The special EPON layers are added to the
   Ethernet layering in the following places:

   The MPCP is placed in the MAC control layer, providing the EPON
   control protocol.  The Emulation layer, located at the RS
   (Reconciliation Sublayer), creates virtual private path to each ONU.
   The FEC layer is located between the PCS and PMA layers, enhancing
   reach and split performance of the optical link.

   The physical link is a fiber optical link.  The OLT and ONUs are
   connected through passive optical splitters.  Downlink denotes the
   transmission from the OLT to the ONUs.  Uplink denotes the
   transmission from the ONUs to the OLT.  Uplink and downlink are
   multiplexed using separated wavelengths on the same fiber.  The
   downlink is a broadcast medium where the OLT transmits the data to
   all ONUs.  The uplink is a shared transmission medium for all of the
   ONUs.  The uplink access is based on time division multiplexing (TDM)
   and the management of the TDM media access is defined by the Multi-

   Point Control Protocol (MPCP).  The MPCP is a control protocol based
   on an inband packet messaging.  The OLT sends control messages (GATE
   messages) allowing ONUs to transmit, defining when the transmission
   occurs and what is its duration.  These messages define the
   transmission order and the amount of BW for each ONU.  A scheduling
   algorithm at the OLT, which is not defined in the [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004.

   responsible for allocating the BW and controlling the delay of each

The transceivers are derivatives of existing Ethernet

   The downstream is a broadcast link, which means that the OLT
   transmission is shared for all ONUs.  The sharing of the transmission
   of the OLT has some negative privacy aspects and should be limited to
   broadcast traffic in nature only.  The traffic dedicated to each ONU
   should not be shared.  The solution provided by [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004.

   partition the EPON link, in a virtual manner, between the ONUs.  Each
   ONU has a dedicated virtual link to the OLT.  The [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004.

   defines an additional link for broadcast transmission.  The medium
   becomes an aggregation of point-to-point tunnels.  The OLT cannot
   preserve its EPON interface as a single interface connected to N
   devices (following the properties of the physical interface).  The
   EPON interface of the OLT is partitioned into separate virtual
   interfaces; an interface for each virtual link.  Hence, the OLT
   behaves like a device with N virtual ports (and an additional port
   for the broadcast transmission).  The additional single-copy-
   broadcast channel (tagged as all one LLID) is added to allow the
   broadcast transmission within a single copy to all ONUs, preserving
   the inherent advantage of BW efficiency of the PON shared media.  The
   ONUs filter the downlink traffic that is not intended for their
   reception, according to the virtual link marking.  An LLID tag is
   attached at the preamble of the Ethernet packet denoting the virtual
   link.  The LLID marks the destination port in the downstream and
   source port in the upstream.

   The virtual links concept is also used to avoid a violation of the
   [<a href="#ref-802.1d" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, 802.1D-2004, IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges."'>802.1d</a>] bridging rules for peer-to-peer traffic in the PON.  Peer-
   to-peer traffic is traffic between ONUs in the same PON.  The OLT
   cannot preserve the EPON interface as a single interface, connected
   to N devices, and allow traffic between these devices without
   violating the bridging rules.  The source address and destination
   address of the peer-to-peer traffic are behind the same port and
   therefore the traffic should be discarded.  The separation of the
   ONUs into virtual links solves this issue.  The OLT has N virtual
   ports for the single physical EPON port.  A bridge sees a single MAC
   Client for every link pair.

   The private paths concept solves the networking problems and provides
   subscriber isolation.

   As the tunneling is only a virtual tunneling, there is a single
   physical interface and a single physical layer for the device so that
   some attributes are shared.  For example, the interface has a single
   local MAC address.

   The virtual tunneling for an OLT with 3 ONUs is illustrated in the
   following diagram.

   The EPON standard defines a media access control of an optical Access
   network.  The Access network has some substantial differences from
   the legacy LAN for which the Ethernet was designed.  The differences
   lie mainly in the provisioning of the network.  An Access network is
   an administrated environment, with an operator providing the service
   and subscribers consuming it.  The operator is controlling the
   network and managing its traffic.  For instance, BW is controlled and
   subscribers are billed for services.  The MPCP protocol divides the
   Ethernet interfaces into two unequal types of network units.  The
   first interface is an OLT interface, which is a server unit,
   controlling the network.  The second interface is an ONU interface,
   which is a client unit, participating in the network.

   The OLT, which is the server unit, manages the network.  The MPCP
   controls the TDM transmission of the uplink.  The MPCP is implemented
   at the MAC control layer and the MPCP messages are MAC control
   messages using the 0x8808 Ethertype.  These messages are not
   forwarded out of the MAC.

   A concept of time must exist in the protocol in order to schedule the
   uplink transmission.  A timestamp, which is set by the OLT and
   synchronized between the network units, is passed through the MPCP
   messages.  The timestamp is also used to measure the RTT of each ONU.
   RTT is compensated by the OLT in the generation of the grants for the
   uplink transmission.  The difference of incoming timestamp to local
   time allows the OLT to calculate the RTT.  RTT compensation is needed
   as the RTT in an Access network can have a significant value.  The
   standard allows the network to reach a 20 km distance, which is
   equivalent to a 200 usec RTT (25 Kbytes of data).

   The TDM control is done using GATE messages.  These messages define,
   for each ONU, the time for transmission and the length of
   transmission.  The RTT is reduced from the transmission time in the
   GATE message to shift the transmission time of the ONU in the
   opposite direction.

   A scheduling algorithm at the OLT, which is not defined in the
   [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004. Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for subscriber access networks."'>802.3ah</a>], is responsible for dividing the BW and controlling the
   transmission delay of each ONU according to its SLA.  The MPCP
   defines a closed loop operation in order for this algorithm to be
   efficient.  The MPCP allows the ONUs to report on the amount of BW
   they require for transmission using a special REPORT message.  This
   allows allocating BW to an ONU only when requested, relying on the
   statistical burst property of the traffic, and allowing different
   peak BW for different ONUs at different times; hence, allowing
   oversubscription of the BW.  The REPORT message reports the amount of
   data waiting in the ONU queues.

   In addition, the MPCP defines a protocol of auto-discovery and
   registration of ONUs.

   A new ONU requests to register (sends a REG_REQUEST message) in a
   special discovery grant, allocated for that by the OLT.  During that
   time, more than one ONU might try to register.  A collision in
   transmission might occur, as the RTT of the new ONUs is not yet
   known.  A random backoff mechanism of the transmission is used to
   schedule the following registration requests to avoid these
   collisions.  When the OLT receives a REG_REQUEST message of an ONU
   and approves this ONU, then it sends a REGISTER message to this ONU
   defining its LLID.  From that point, the ONU transmission is
   scheduled by its LLID, knowing the RTT, and no collision can occur.
   The ONU replies with a REGISTER_ACK message and the registration
   process of the MPCP ends.  Higher layer protocols may be needed to
   authenticate the ONU and allow it to participate in the network.

   The FEC is defined to enhance the link budget of the PON.  As each
   splitter attenuates the optical signal, the number of the splits and
   the distance are limited by the link budget.  Hence an FEC that

   improves the link budget has a benefit.  The FEC code used is the
   RS(239,255,8), similar to the FEC code in [<a href="#ref-ITU-T.G.975" title='"ITU-T, SERIES G: TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS AND MEDIA, DIGITAL SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS Digital sections and digital line system - Optical fibre submarine cable systems Forward error correction for submarine systems, ITU-T Recommendation G.975"'>ITU-T.G.975</a>], improving
   the BER from 1E-4 to 1E-12.

   The FEC parity encapsulation is based on the framing of the Ethernet
   packet.  The Ethernet packets are spaced by MAC rate adaptation, and
   the parity bytes are inserted after the packet in the provided space.

   As the start and end of packet codewords also define the FEC
   boundaries, and they are outside the FEC protection, they are
   replaced by a series of symbols to reduce their vulnerability to
   errors.

   The following diagram presents an FEC-protected frame:

   The FEC is added in a separate layer between the PCS and PMA layers
   of the [<a href="#ref-802.3" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE Std 802.3-2002, "'>802.3</a>].

   The FEC layer introduces a fixed delay in receive path and transmit

   The association is straightforward for the ONU interface.  There is
   one logical and one physical interface, and a single copy exists for
   each layer that can be remotely queried by the OLT.

   At the OLT there is a single physical interface and N virtual
   interfaces for the virtual links of the ONUs (and another virtual
   interface for the broadcast virtual link).  As can be seen from the
   layering diagram above, the MAC layer is virtually duplicated.
   Therefore, in this document it was selected that the management of a
   virtual interface is like a physical interface, an interface index is
   allocated for each one of the virtual links, and an additional
   interface index is allocated for the OLT.

   To illustrate the interface modeling consider two devices; the first
   device has two physical interfaces, is typically located at a
   consumer's site, and is called an "ONU modem".

   An "ONU modem" is shown in the figure below:

                            --------
             ONU interface | ONU   | 10 megabit interface
             --------------| modem |--------------------
                           ---------

   This device would have 3 entries in the IF table, and one IF stack
   entry; for example:

   ifIndex=1 - interface for 10 megabit interface

   ifIndex=2 - interface for the optical interface

   ifIndex=200 - interface for the ONU interface

   And then in the IF stack table:

   ifStackHigherLayer=200, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the
   physical and the ONU

   The second device has three physical interfaces, is typically located
   at the provider's site, and may be called a "headend".

   A "headend" is shown in the figure below:

                               ---------
             1st OLT interface | Head  | gigE interface
             ------------------| end   |--------------------
                               |       |
             ------------------|       |
             2nd OLT interface |       |
                               ---------

   This device would have 5 entries (when there are no attached ONUs) in
   the IF table, for example:

   ifIndex=1 - interface for gigE interface

   ifIndex=2 - interface for 1st optical interface

   ifIndex=3 - interface for 2nd optical interface

   ifIndex=265535 - interface for the 1st OLT broadcast interface

   ifIndex=365535 - interface for the 2nd OLT broadcast interface

   And then in the IF stack table:

   ifStackHigherLayer=265535, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the 1st
   physical and its broadcast interface

   ifStackHigherLayer=365535, ifStackLowerLayer=3 - map between the 2nd
   physical and its broadcast interface

   If two ONUs connected to the first OLT interface, then for example,
   the following entries would be added to the IF table:

   ifIndex=200001 - interface for the 1st ONU of 1st OLT

   ifIndex=200002 - interface for the 2nd ONU of 1st OLT

   And in the IF stack table:

   ifStackHigherLayer=200001, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the 1st
   physical and 1st ONU

   ifStackHigherLayer=200002, ifStackLowerLayer=2 - map between the 1st
   physical and 2nd ONU

   For each physical interface, there would be an entry (ifIndex) in the
   tables of the interface MIB module [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>], MAU MIB module
   [<a href="rfc4836.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs)"'>RFC4836</a>], and Etherlike MIB module [<a href="rfc3635.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC3635</a>].  Additionally, there
   would be entries (ifIndexes) for the virtual interfaces of the OLT
   interface.  The justification for the additional allocation of
   indexes is that the virtual interfaces are quite well distinguished,
   as they connect different physical ONUs from the OLT side.  For
   instance, there is a meaning for separate bad frames counter or bad
   octets counter for each virtual link, as the ONUs can be differently
   distanced.  This is quite similar to a case of separate physical
   interfaces.

   The same partition concept exists for the MIB module of this
   document.  Each row in the tables are indexed according to the
   ifIndex; specifically, there is a row for each virtual link.  There
   are some control objects that are shared and are the same for the
   virtual interfaces (and they should have the same value for each
   ifIndex), but most of the objects have different values for N+1
   logical interfaces at the OLT.  This is done for each MIB group.  It
   is a bit different from the [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004.

   the management of the layers for the virtual links, as the atomic

Relation to the Interfaces MIB and Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB</span>

   EPON interface is a kind of Ether-like interface.  This MIB module
   extends the objects of the Interface MIB and the Ether-like
   Interfaces MIB for an EPON type interface.

   Implementing this module therefore MUST require implementation of the
   Interfaces MIB module [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>] and the Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB
   module [<a href="rfc3635.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC3635</a>].

   Thus, each managed EPON interface would have a corresponding entry in
   the mandatory tables of the Ether-like MIB module found in [<a href="rfc3635.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC3635</a>],
   and likewise in the tables of the Interface MIB module found in
   [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>].  Also each managed virtual EPON interface would have a
   corresponding entry in the mandatory tables of the Ether-like MIB
   module found in [<a href="rfc3635.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC3635</a>], and likewise in the tables of the
   Interface MIB module found in [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>] with a dedicated ifIndex for
   this interface.

   In this document, there is no replication of the objects from these
   MIBs.  Therefore, for instance, the document is defining
   dot3MpcpRemoteMACAddress only while assuming that the local MAC
   address object is already defined in [<a href="rfc3635.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for the Ethernet-like Interface Types"'>RFC3635</a>].

   The interface MIB module [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>] defines the interface index
   (ifIndex).  Interface Index, as specified in [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>], is used in
   this MIB Module as an index to the EPON MIB tables.  The ifIndex is
   used to denote the physical interface and the virtual link interfaces
   at the OLT.  The OLT interface and the virtual link interfaces are
   stacked using the ifStack table defined in [<a href="rfc2863.html" title='"The Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2863</a>], and the
   ifInvStack defined in [<a href="rfc2864.html" title='"The Inverted Stack Table Extension to the Interfaces Group MIB"'>RFC2864</a>].  The OLT interface is the lower
   layer of all other interfaces associated with the virtual links.

   This document defines the specific EPON objects of an ONU interface
   and an OLT interface.  Information in the tables is per LLID.  The
   rows in the EPON MIB tables referring to the LLIDs are denoted with
   the corresponding ifIndexes of the virtual link interfaces.

   Please note that each virtual interface does not have a different
   physical MAC address at the OLT, as the physical interface is the
   same.  It is specified in the [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004. Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for subscriber access networks."'>802.3ah</a>], Section 64.1.2.  The
   corresponding object of the Ether-like interface MIB is duplicated
   for all the virtual interfaces.

   For example, the values of the Interface MIB objects are presented in
   the following tables, for an OLT with 3 registered ONUs:

   The rows for the ONU interface, the OLT interface, and the OLT
   broadcast interface are created in initialization.

   The creation of a row for a virtual link is done when the virtual
   link is established (ONU registers), and deletion is done when the
   virtual link is deleted (ONU deregisters).

   The EPON MIB module also extends the Interface MIB module with a set
   of counters, which are specific for the EPON interface.  The EPON MIB
   module implements the same handling of the counters when the
   operation of the interface starts or stops.  The interface MIB
   document describes the possible behavior of counters when an
   interface is re-initialized using the ifCounterDiscontinuityTime
   indicator, indicating the discontinuity of the counters.  Please see
   <a href="rfc2863.html#section-3.1.5">[RFC2863], Section 3.1.5</a>, page 11 for more information.  The counters
   of the EPON MIB should be handled in a similar manner.

   The MAU types of the EPON Interface are defined in the amended MAU
   MIB document.  This document assumes the implementation of the MAU
   MIB for this purpose and does not repeat the EPON MAU types.
   Therefore, implementing this module MUST require implementation of
   the MAU-MIB module [<a href="rfc4836.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 Medium Attachment Units (MAUs)"'>RFC4836</a>].

   The handling of the ifMAU tables for the EPON case is similar to the
   handling described in the former section for the Interface and Ether-
   like interface MIBs.  A single row exists for the ONU in the
   ifMauTable.  A row for each virtual link (N+1 rows) exists at the
   OLT, with a separate value of ifMauIfIndex for each virtual link.

   As specified above, the rows for the ONU interface, the OLT
   interface, and the OLT broadcast interface are created in
   initialization.

   The creation of a row for a virtual link is done when the virtual
   link is established (ONU registers), and deletion is done when the
   virtual link is deleted (ONU deregisters).

   The EPON interfaces are aimed to the optical access networks and most
   probably will be accompanied with the implementation of the OAM
   section of the [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004.

Therefore, the EFM OAM MIB module
   [<a href="rfc4878.html" title='"Definitions and Managed Objects for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Functions on Ethernet-Like Interfaces"'>RFC4878</a>] MAY be implemented when this MIB module is implemented
   defining managed objects for the OAM layer that are complementary to
   the EFM EPON MIB module.  As the OAM is defined for a point-to-point
   link it is implemented in this case using the virtual links that are

   defined for the P2MP network, so that an instance is held for each
   Logical Link Identifier (LLID) of the EPON.  The corresponding
   ifIndex of the virtual link is used as the ifIndex of the tables of
   the OAM MIB module for this purpose.

   It is very probable that an EPON OLT will implement a bridging
   functionality above the EPON interface layer, bridging between the
   EPON users and the network.  Bridge functionality is specified at
   [<a href="#ref-802.1d" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, 802.1D-2004, IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges."'>802.1d</a>].  In this scenario, the virtual ports of the EPON are
   corresponding to the virtual bridge ports.  There is a direct mapping
   between the bridge ports and the LLIDs, which are virtual EPON
   channels.

   Therefore, the bridge MIB modules ([<a href="rfc4188.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges"'>RFC4188</a>] and [<a href="rfc1525.html" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Source Routing Bridges"'>RFC1525</a>]) MAY be
   implemented when the EFM EPON MIB module is implemented for an EPON
   OLT, defining managed objects for the bridge layer.

   The values of dot1dBasePortIfIndex would correspond to the ifIndex of
   the virtual port (1 for LLID1, 2 for LLID2, etc.).

   The broadcast virtual EPON interface of the OLT has no direct mapping
   to a virtual bridge port as it is not port specific but used for
   broadcast traffic.

            this object are extensions to the FEC modes defined in
            the dot3EponFecMode object.
            When noFECEnabled(1), the interface does not enable FEC

            When fecTxEnabled(2), the interface enables the FEC
            transmit mode.
            When fecRxEnabled(3), the interface enables the FEC
            receive mode.
            When fecTxRxEnabled(4), the interface enables the FEC
            transmit and receive mode.
            This object is applicable for an OLT and an ONU.  At the
            OLT, it has a distinct value for each virtual interface.
            The FEC counters are referring to the receive path.  The
            FEC counters will stop when the FEC receive mode of the
            interface is disabled, as defined by fecRxEnabled(3)
            and fecTxRxEnabled(4) values.
            The counters:
             dot3EponFecPCSCodingViolation - not affected by FEC
             mode.
             dot3EponFecCorrectedBlocks - stops counting when
             Rx_FEC is not enabled (noFecEnabled(1) and

             when Rx_FEC is not enabled (noFecEnabled(1) and
             fecTxEnabled(2)).
            The objects:
             dot3EponFecAbility - indicates the FEC ability and is
             not affected by the FEC mode.

               The 'Queue report' field reports the occupancy of each
               uplink transmission queue.
               The number of queue sets defines the number of the

               can report up to 8 queues in a REPORT message, the
               actual number is flexible.  The Queue table has a

               ONU can have fewer queues to report.

               and it can report in a single MPCP REPORT message
               of a few sets of queues.
               The number of queue_sets defines the number of the
               reported sets, and it can reach a value of up to 8.
               It means that an ONU can hold a variable number of
               sets between 0 and 7.
               The dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable table has a variable
               queue_set size that is limited by the
               dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumThreshold object as an
               ONU can have fewer queue_sets to report.
               The 'Queue report' field reports the occupancy of each
               uplink transmission queue.  The queue_sets can be used to
               report the occupancy of the queues in a few levels as to
               allow granting, in an accurate manner, of only part of
               the data available in the queues.  A Threshold is
               defined for each queue_set to define the level of the
               queue that is counted for the report of the occupancy.
               The threshold is reflected in the queue_set table by the
               dot3ExtPkgObjectReportThreshold object.
               For each queue set, the report bitmap defines which
               queues are present in the report, meaning that
               although the MPCP REPORT message can report of up to 8
               queues in a REPORT message, the actual number is
               flexible.
               The dot3ExtPkgQueueSetsTable table has a variable queue
               size that is limited by the
               dot3ExtPkgObjectReportMaximumNumQueues object as an ONU
               can have fewer queues to report.
               Each object has a row for every virtual link, for each
               queue in the report and for each queue_set in the queue.
               The LLID field, as defined in the [<a href="#ref-802.3ah" title='"Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004.

               register (15-bit field and a broadcast bit) limiting the

               broadcast LLID (with a value of 0xffff).
               The number of queues is between 0 and 7 and limited by

               there is a row in the table for each virtual interface.
               The reason for having a separate row for each virtual
               link is that the OLT has a separate link for each one of
               the ONUs.  For instance, ONUs could be in different
               distances with different link budgets and different
               receive powers, therefore having different power alarms.

               interface to start transmission (according to the

   There are number of managed objects defined in this MIB module that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Writing to
   these objects can have potentially disruptive effects on network
   operation, including:

   Changing dot3MpcpAdminState state can lead to disabling the
   Multi-Point Control Protocol on the respective interface, leading to
   the interruption of service for the users connected to the respective
   EPON interface.

   Changing dot3EponFecMode state can lead to disabling the Forward
   Error Correction on the respective interface, which can lead to a
   degradation of the optical link, and therefore may lead to an
   interruption of service for the users connected to the respective
   EPON interface.

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectReset state can lead to a reset of the
   respective interface leading to an interruption of service for the
   users connected to the respective EPON interface.

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectPowerDown state can lead to a power down of
   the respective interface, leading to an interruption of service for
   the users connected to the respective EPON interface.

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectFecEnabled state can lead to disabling the
   Forward Error Correction on the respective interface, which can lead
   to a degradation of the optical link, and therefore may lead to an
   interruption of service for the users connected to the respective
   EPON interface.

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectRegisterAction state can lead to a change in
   the registration state of the respective interface, leading to a
   deregistration and an interruption of service for the users connected
   to the respective EPON interface.

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectReportNumThreshold can lead to a change in
   the reporting of the ONU interface and therefore to a change in the
   bandwidth allocation of the respective interface.  This change may
   lead a degradation or an interruption of service for the users
   connected to the respective EPON interface.

   Changing dot3ExtPkgObjectReportThreshold can lead to a change in the
   reporting of the ONU interface and therefore to a change in the
   bandwidth allocation of the respective interface.  This change may
   lead a degradation or an interruption of service for the users
   connected to the respective EPON interface.

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfLowerInputPowerThreshold can lead to a
   Threshold Crossing Alert (TCA) being sent for the respective
   interface.  This alert may be leading to an interruption of service
   for the users connected to the respective EPON interface, depending
   on the system action on such an alert.

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfUpperInputPowerThreshold can lead to a
   Threshold Crossing Alert (TCA) being sent for the respective
   interface.  This alert may be leading to an interruption of service
   for the users connected to the respective EPON interface, depending
   on the system action on such an alert.

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfLowerOutputPowerThreshold can lead to a
   Threshold Crossing Alert (TCA) being sent for the respective
   interface.  This alert may be leading to an interruption of service
   for the users connected to the respective EPON interface, depending

   interface.  This alert may be leading to an interruption of service

   Changing dot3ExtPkgOptIfTransmitEnable state can lead to a halt in
   the optical transmission of the respective interface, leading to an
   interruption of service for the users connected to the respective
   EPON interface.

   The user of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-ACCESS
   other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
   performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In such environments it is important to control
   even GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly even to
   encrypt their values when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see <a href="rfc3410.html#section-8">[RFC3410], section 8</a>),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
