pseudowires are used to transport the HC context and control messages
between the ingress and egress MPLS label switching routers. This is
defined for a specific set of existing HC mechanisms that might be
used, for example, to support voice over IP. This specification also
describes extension mechanisms to allow support for future, as yet to
be defined, HC protocols. In this specification, each HC protocol
operates independently over a single pseudowire instance, very much as
it would over a single point-to-point link. [STANDARDS-TRACK]" name="DC.Description.Abstract"/>

Abstract

   This specification defines how to use Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) to route Header-Compressed (HC) packets over an MPLS label
   switched path.  HC can significantly reduce packet-header overhead
   and, in combination with MPLS, can also increases bandwidth
   efficiency and processing scalability in terms of the maximum number
   of simultaneous compressed flows that use HC at each router).  Here
   we define how MPLS pseudowires are used to transport the HC context
   and control messages between the ingress and egress MPLS label
   switching routers.  This is defined for a specific set of existing HC
   mechanisms that might be used, for example, to support voice over IP.
   This specification also describes extension mechanisms to allow
   support for future, as yet to be defined, HC protocols.  In this
   specification, each HC protocol operates independently over a single
   pseudowire instance, very much as it would over a single point-to-
   point link.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Voice over IP (VoIP) typically uses the encapsulation
   voice/RTP/UDP/IP.  When MPLS labels [<a href="rfc3031.html" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>RFC3031</a>] are added, this becomes
   voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels.  MPLS VPNs (e.g., [<a href="rfc4364.html" title='"BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPN)s"'>RFC4364</a>]) use label
   stacking, and in the simplest case of IPv4 the total packet header is
   at least 48 bytes, while the voice payload is often no more than 30
   bytes, for example.  When IPv6 is used, the relative size of the
   header in comparison to the payload is even greater.  The interest in
   header compression (HC) is to exploit the possibility of
   significantly reducing the overhead through various compression
   mechanisms, such as with enhanced compressed RTP (ECRTP) [<a href="rfc3545.html" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers on Links with High Delay, Packet Loss, and Reordering,"'>RFC3545</a>]
   and robust header compression (ROHC) [RFC3095, RFC3095bis, <a href="rfc4815.html">RFC4815</a>],
   and also to increase scalability of HC.  MPLS is used to route HC
   packets over an MPLS label switched path (LSP) without
   compression/decompression cycles at each router.  Such an HC over
   MPLS capability can increase bandwidth efficiency as well as the
   processing scalability of the maximum number of simultaneous
   compressed flows that use HC at each router.  Goals and requirements
   for HC over MPLS are discussed in [<a href="rfc4247.html" title='"Requirements for Header Compression over MPLS"'>RFC4247</a>].  The solution using MPLS
   pseudowire (PW) technology put forth in this document has been
   designed to address these goals and requirements.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   Context: the state associated with a flow subject to IP header
   compression.  While the exact nature of the context is specific to a
   particular HC protocol (CRTP, ECRTP, ROHC, etc.), this state
   typically includes:

      - the values of all of the fields in all of the headers (IP, UDP,
        TCP, RTP, Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), etc.) that the
        particular header compression protocol operates on for the last
        packet of the flow sent (by the compressor) or received (by the
        decompressor).

      - the change in the value of some of the fields in the IP, UDP,
        TCP, etc. headers between the last two consecutive sent packets
        (compressor) or received packets (decompressor) of the flow.
        Some of the fields in the header change by a constant amount
        between subsequent packets in the flow most of the time.  Saving
        the changes in these fields from packet to packet allows

        verification that a constant rate of change is taking place, and
        to take appropriate action when a deviation from the normal
        changes are encountered.

   For most HC protocols, a copy of the context of each compressed flow

   protocol described in [<a href="rfc2508.html" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links"'>RFC2508</a>].

   Context ID (CID): a small number, typically 8 or 16 bits, used to
   identify a particular flow, and the context associated with the flow.
   Most HC protocols in essence work by sending the CID across the link
   in place of the full header, along with any unexpected changes in the
   values in the various fields of the headers.

   Enhanced Compressed Real-time Protocol (ECRTP): a particular HC
   protocol described in [<a href="rfc3545.html" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers on Links with High Delay, Packet Loss, and Reordering,"'>RFC3545</a>].

   Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC): a group of packets that are
   forwarded in the same manner (e.g., over the same LSP, with the same
   forwarding treatment)

   Header Compression scheme (HC scheme):  a particular method of
   performing HC and its associated protocol.  Multiple methods of HC
   have been defined, including Robust Header Compression (ROHC

   This document explicitly supports all of the HC schemes listed above,
   and is intended to be extensible to others that may be developed.

   Header Compression channel (HC channel): a session established
   between a header compressor and a header decompressor using a single
   HC scheme, over which multiple individual flows may be compressed.
   From this perspective, every PPP link over which HC is operating
   defines a single HC channel, and based on this specification, every
   HC PW defines a single HC channel.  HC PWs are bi-directional, which
   means that a unidirectional leg of the PW is set up in each
   direction.  One leg of the bi-directional PW may be set up to carry
   only compression feedback, not header compressed traffic.  An HC
   channel should not be confused with the individual traffic flows that
   may be compressed using a single Context ID.  Each HC channel manages
   a set of unique CIDs.

   IP Header Compression (IPHC): a particular HC protocol described in
   [<a href="rfc2507.html" title='"IP Header Compression"'>RFC2507</a>]

   To implement HC over MPLS, after the ingress router applies the HC
   algorithm to the IP packet, the compressed packet is forwarded on an
   MPLS LSP using MPLS labels, and then the egress router restores the
   uncompressed header.  Any of a number of HC algorithms/protocols can
   be used.  These algorithms have generally been designed for operation
   over a single point-to-point link-layer hop.  MPLS PWs [<a href="rfc3985.html" title='"Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to- Edge (PWE3) Architecture,"'>RFC3985</a>],
   which are used to provide emulation of many point-to-point link layer
   services (such as frame relay permanent virtual circuits (PVCs) and
   ATM PVCs) are used here to provide emulation of a single, point-to-
   point link layer hop over which HC traffic may be transported.

   Figure 1 illustrates an HC over MPLS channel established on an LSP
   that traverses several LSRs, from R1/HC --&gt; R2 --&gt; R3 --&gt; R4/HD,
   where R1/HC is the ingress router performing HC, and R4/HD is the
   egress router performing header decompression (HD).  This example
   assumes that the packet flow being compressed has RTP/UDP/IP headers
   and is using a HC scheme such as ROHC, CRTP, or ECRTP.  Compression
   of the RTP/UDP/IP header is performed at R1/HC, and the compressed
   packets are routed using MPLS labels from R1/HC to R2, to R3, and
   finally to R4/HD, without further decompression/recompression cycles.
   The RTP/UDP/IP header is decompressed at R4/HD and can be forwarded
   to other routers, as needed.  This example assumes that the
   application is VoIP and that the HC algorithm operates on the RTP,
   UDP, and IP headers of the VoIP flows.  This is an extremely common
   application of HC, but need not be the only one.  The HC algorithms
   supported by the protocol extensions specified in this document may
   operate on TCP or IPsec ESP headers as well.

      Figure 1: Example of HC over MPLS over Routers R1 --&gt; R4

   In the example scenario, HC therefore takes place between R1 and R4,
   and the MPLS LSP transports data/compressed-header/MPLS-labels
   instead of data/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels, often saving more than 90% of
   the RTP/UDP/IP overhead.  Typically there are two MPLS labels (8
   octets) and a link-layer HC control parameter (2 octets).  The MPLS
   label stack and link-layer headers are not compressed.  Therefore, HC
   over MPLS can significantly reduce the header overhead through
   compression mechanisms.

   HC reduces the IP/UDP/RTP headers to 2-4 bytes for most packets.
   Half of the reduction in header size comes from the observation that
   half of the bytes in the IP/UDP/RTP headers remain constant over the
   life of the flow.  After sending the uncompressed header template
   once, these fields may be removed from the compressed headers that



<span class="grey">Ash, et al.                 Standards Track                     [Page 7]</span></pre>

   follow.  The remaining compression comes from the observation that
   although several fields change in every packet, the difference from
   packet to packet is often constant or at least limited, and therefore
   the second-order difference is zero.

   The compressor and decompressor both maintain a context for each
   compressed flow.  The context is the session state shared between the
   compressor and decompressor.  The details of what is included in the
   context may vary between HC schemes.  The context at the compressor
   would typically include the uncompressed headers of the last packet
   sent on the flow, and some measure of the differences in selected
   header field values between the last packet transmitted and the
   packet(s) transmitted just before it.  The context at the
   decompressor would include similar information about received
   packets.  With this information, all that must be communicated across
   the wire is an indication of which flow a packet is associated with
   (the CID), and some compact encoding of the second order differences
   (i.e., the harder to predict differences) between packets.

   MPLS PWs [<a href="rfc3985.html" title='"Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to- Edge (PWE3) Architecture,"'>RFC3985</a>] are used to transport the HC packets between the
   ingress and egress MPLS LSRs.  Each PW acts like a logical point-to-
   point link between the compressor and the decompressor.  Each PW
   supports a single HC channel, which, from the perspective of the HC
   scheme operation, is similar to a single PPP link or a single frame
   relay PVC.  One exception to this general model is that PWs carry
   only packets with compressed headers, and do not share the PW with
   uncompressed packets.

   The PW architecture specifies the use of a label stack with at least
   2 levels.  The label at the bottom of the stack is called the PW
   label.  The PW label acts as an identifier for a particular PW.  With
   HC PWs, the compressor adds the label at the bottom of the stack and
   the decompressor removes this label.  No LSRs between the compressor
   and decompressor inspect or modify this label.  Labels higher in the
   stack are called the packet switch network (PSN) labels, and are used
   to forward the packet through the MPLS network as described in
   [<a href="rfc3031.html" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>RFC3031</a>].  The decompressor uses the incoming MPLS PW label (the
   label at the bottom of the stack), along with the CID to locate the
   proper decompression context.  Standard HC methods (e.g., ECRTP,
   ROHC, etc.) are used to determine the contexts.  The CIDs are
   assigned by the HC as normal, and there would be no problem if
   duplicate CIDs are received at the HD for different PWs, which
   support different compressed channels.  For example, if two different
   compressors, HCa and HCb, both assign the same CID to each of 2
   separate flows destined to decompressor HDc, HDc can still
   differentiate the flows and locate the proper decompression context
   for each, because the tuples &lt;PWlabel-HCa, CID&gt; and &lt;PWlabel-HCb,
   CID&gt; are still unique.

   In addition to the PW label and PSN label(s), HC over MPLS packets
   also carry a HC control parameter.  The HC control parameter contains
   both a packet type field and a packet length field.  The packet type
   field is needed because each HC scheme supported by this
   specification defines multiple packet types, for example, "full
   header" packets, which are used to initialize and/or re-synchronize
   the context between compressor and decompressor, vs. normal HC
   packets.  And most of the HC schemes require that the underlying link
   layer protocols provide the differentiation between packet types.
   Similarly, one of the assumptions that is part of most of the HC
   schemes is that the packet length fields in the RTP/UDP/IP, etc.
   headers need not be explicitly sent across the network, because the
   IP datagram length can be implicitly determined from the lower
   layers.  This specification assumes that, with one exception, the
   length of an HC IP datagram can be determined from the link layers of
   the packets transmitted across the MPLS network.  The exception is
   for packets that traverse an Ethernet link.  Ethernet requires
   padding for packets whose payload size is less than 46 bytes in
   length.  So the HC control parameter contains a length field of 6
   bits to encode the lengths of any HC packets less than 64 bytes in
   length.

   HC PWs are set up by the PW signaling protocol [<a href="rfc4447.html" title='"Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)"'>RFC4447</a>].  [<a href="rfc4447.html" title='"Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)"'>RFC4447</a>]
   actually defines a set of extensions to the MPLS label distribution
   protocol (LDP) [<a href="rfc3036.html" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC3036</a>].  As defined in [<a href="rfc4447.html" title='"Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)"'>RFC4447</a>], LDP signaling to
   set up, tear down, and manage PWs is performed directly between the
   PW endpoints, in this case, the compressor and the decompressor.  PW
   signaling is used only to set up the PW label at the bottom of the
   stack, and is used independently of any other signaling that may be
   used to set up PSN labels.  So, for example, in Figure 1, LDP PW
   signaling would be performed directly between R1/HC and R4/HD.
   Router R2 and R3 would not participate in PW signaling.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4447" name="ref-RFC4447">RFC4447</a>] provides extensions to LDP for PWs, and this document
   provides further extensions specific to HC.  Since PWs provide a
   logical point-to-point connection over which HC can be run, the
   extensions specified in this document reuse elements of the protocols
   used to negotiate HC over the Point-to-Point Protocol [<a href="rfc1661.html" title='"The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)"'>RFC1661</a>].
   [<a href="rfc3241.html" title='"Robust Header Compression (ROHC) over PPP"'>RFC3241</a>] specifies how ROHC is used over PPP and [<a href="rfc3544.html" title='"IP Header Compression over PPP,"'>RFC3544</a>] specifies
   how several other HC schemes (CRTP, ECRTP, IPHC) are used over PPP.
   Both of these RFCs provide configuration options for negotiating HC
   over PPP.  The formats of these configuration options are reused here
   for setting up HC over PWs.  When used in the PPP environment, these
   configuration options are used as extensions to PPP's IP Control
   Protocol [<a href="rfc1332.html" title='"The PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)"'>RFC1332</a>] and the detailed PPP options negotiations process
   described in [<a href="rfc1661.html" title='"The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)"'>RFC1661</a>].  This is necessary because a PPP link may
   support multiple protocols, each with its own addressing scheme and
   options.  Achieving interoperability requires a negotiation process



<span class="grey">Ash, et al.                 Standards Track                     [Page 9]</span></pre>

   so that the nodes at each end of the link can agree on a set of
   protocols and options that both support.  However, a single HC PW
   supports only HC traffic using a single HC scheme.  So while the
   formats of configuration options from [<a href="rfc3241.html" title='"Robust Header Compression (ROHC) over PPP"'>RFC3241</a>] and [<a href="rfc3544.html" title='"IP Header Compression over PPP,"'>RFC3544</a>] are
   reused here, the detailed PPP negotiation process is not.  Instead,
   these options are reused here just as descriptors (TLVs in the
   specific terminology of LDP and [<a href="rfc4447.html" title='"Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)"'>RFC4447</a>]) of basic parameters of an
   HC PW.  These parameters are further described in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  The HC
   configuration parameters are initially generated by the decompressor
   and describe what the decompressor is prepared to receive.

   Most HC schemes use a feedback mechanism which requires bi-
   directional flow of HC packets, even if the flow of compressed IP
   packets is in one direction only.  The basic signaling process of
   [<a href="rfc4447.html" title='"Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)"'>RFC4447</a>] sets up unidirectional PWs, and must be repeated in each
   direction in order to set up the bi-directional flow needed for HC.

   Figure 1 illustrates an example data flow set up from R1/HC --&gt; R2
   --&gt; R3 --&gt; R4/HD, where R1/HC is the ingress router where header
   compression is performed, and R4/HD is the egress router where header
   decompression is done.  Each router functions as an LSR and supports
   signaling of LSP/PWs.  See <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> for a detailed example of how
   the flow depicted in Figure 1 is established.

   All the HC schemes used here are built so that if an uncompressible
   packet is seen, it should just be sent uncompressed.  For some types
   of compression (e.g., IPHC-TCP), a non-compressed path is required.
   For IPHC-TCP compression, uncompressible packets occur for every TCP
   flow.  Another way that this kind of issue can occur is if MAX_HEADER
   is configured lower than the longest header, in which case,
   compression might not be possible in some cases.

   The uncompressed packets associated with HC flows (e.g., uncompressed
   IPHC-TCP packets) can be sent through the same MPLS tunnel along with
   all other non-HC (non-PW) IP packets.  MPLS tunnels can transport
   many types of packets simultaneously, including non-PW IP packets,
   layer 3 VPN packets, and PW (e.g., HC flow) packets.  In the
   specification, we assume that there is a path for uncompressed
   traffic, and it is a compressor decision as to what would or would
   not go in the HC-PW.

             Figure 2: Pseudowire Protocol Stack Reference Model

   Each HC-HD compressed channel is mapped to a single PW and associated
   with 2 PW labels, one in each direction.  A single PW label MUST be
   used for many HC flows (could be 100's or 1000's) rather than
   assigning a different PW label to each flow.  The latter approach
   would involve a complex mechanism for PW label assignment, freeing up
   of labels after a flow terminates, etc., for potentially 1000's of
   simultaneous HC flows.  On the other hand, the mechanism for CID
   assignment, freeing up, etc., is in place and there is no need to
   duplicate it with PW assignment/deassignment for individual HC flows.

   Multiple PWs SHOULD be established in case different quality of
   service (QoS) requirements are needed for different compressed
   streams.  The QoS received by the flow would be determined by the EXP
   bit marking in the PW label.  Normally, all RTP packets would get the
   same EXP marking [<a href="rfc3270.html" title='"Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Support of Differentiated Services,"'>RFC3270</a>], equivalent to expedited forwarding (EF)
   treatment [<a href="rfc3246.html" title='"An Expedited Forwarding PHB (Per- Hop Behavior),"'>RFC3246</a>] in Diffserv.  However, the protocol specified in
   this document applies to several different types of streams, not just
   RTP streams, and QoS treatment other than EF may be required for
   those streams.

   Figure 3 shows the HC over MPLS protocol stack (with uncompressed
   header):

     Figure 3: Header Compression over MPLS Media Stream Transport

   The HC control parameter MUST be used to identify the packet types
   for the HC scheme in use.  The MPLS labels technically define two
   layers: the PW identifier and the MPLS tunnel identifier.  The PW
   label MUST be used as the demultiplexer field by the HD, where the PW
   label appears at the bottom label of an MPLS label stack.  The LSR
   that will be performing decompression MUST ensure that the label it
   distributes (e.g., via LDP) for a channel is unique.  There can also

   be other MPLS labels, for example, to identify an MPLS VPN.  The
   IP/UDP/RTP headers are compressed before transmission, leaving the
   rest of the stack alone, as shown in Figure 3.

   PWs MUST be set up in advance for the transport of media streams
   using [<a href="rfc4447.html" title='"Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)"'>RFC4447</a>] control messages exchanged by the HC-HD endpoints.
   Furthermore, a PW type MUST be used to indicate the HC scheme being
   used on the PW.  [<a href="rfc4447.html" title='"Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)"'>RFC4447</a>] specifies the MPLS label distribution
   protocol (LDP) [<a href="rfc3036.html" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC3036</a>] extensions to set up and maintain the PWs,
   and defines new LDP objects to identify and signal attributes of PWs.
   Any acceptable method of MPLS label distribution MAY be used for
   distributing the MPLS tunnel label [<a href="rfc3031.html" title='"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture"'>RFC3031</a>].  These methods include
   LDP [<a href="rfc3036.html" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC3036</a>], RSVP-TE [<a href="rfc3209.html" title='"RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels,"'>RFC3209</a>], or configuration.

   To assign and distribute the PW labels, an LDP session MUST be set up
   between the PW endpoints using the extended discovery mechanism
   described in [<a href="rfc3036.html" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC3036</a>].  The PW label bindings are distributed using
   the LDP downstream unsolicited mode described in [<a href="rfc3036.html" title='"LDP Specification"'>RFC3036</a>].  An LDP
   label mapping message contains a FEC object, a label object, and
   possible other optional objects.  The FEC object indicates the
   meaning of the label, identifies the PW type, and identifies the PW
   that the PW label is bound to.  See [<a href="rfc4447.html" title='"Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)"'>RFC4447</a>] for further explanation
   of PW signaling.

   This specification defines new PW type values to be carried within
   the FEC object to identify HC PWs for each HC scheme.  The PW type is
   a 15-bit parameter assigned by IANA, as specified in the [<a href="rfc4446.html" title='"IANA Allocations for Pseudo Wire Edge To Edge Emulation (PWE3),"'>RFC4446</a>]
   registry, and MUST be used to indicate the HC scheme being used on
   the PW.  IANA has set aside the following PW type values for
   assignment according to the registry specified in <a href="rfc4446.html#section-3.2">RFC 4446, Section </a>
   <a href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>:

   The HC control parameter enables distinguishing between various
   packets types (e.g., uncompressed, UDP compressed, RTP compressed,
   context-state, etc.).  However, the HC control parameter indications
   are not unique across HC schemes, and therefore the PW type value
   allows the HC scheme to be identified.

   As described in the previous section, the HC PW MUST be used for
   compressed packets only, which is configured at PW setup.  If a flow
   is not compressed, it MUST NOT be placed on the HC PW.  HC PWs MUST
   be bi-directional, which means that a unidirectional leg of the PW
   MUST be set up in each direction.  One leg of the bi-directional PW
   MAY be set up to carry only compression feedback, not header
   compressed traffic.  The same PW type MUST be used for PW signaling
   in both directions.

   HC scheme parameters MAY be manually configured, but if so, manual
   configuration MUST be done in both directions.  If HC scheme
   parameters are signaled, the Interface Parameters Sub-TLV MUST be
   used on any unidirectional legs of a PW that will carry HC traffic.
   For a unidirectional leg of a PW that will carry only compression
   feedback, the components of the Interface Parameters Sub-TLV
   described below are not relevant and MUST NOT be used.

   The PW HC approach relies on the PW/MPLS layer to convey HC channel
   configuration information.  The Interface Parameters Sub-TLV [IANA,
   <a href="rfc4447.html">RFC4447</a>] must be used to signal HC channel setup and specify HC
   parameters.  That is, the configuration options specified in
   [RFC3241, <a href="rfc3544.html">RFC3544</a>] are reused in this specification to specify PW-
   specific parameters, and to configure the HC and HD ports at the
   edges of the PW so that they have the necessary capabilities to
   interoperate with each other.

   Pseudowire Interface Parameter Sub-TLV type values are specified in
   [<a href="rfc4446.html" title='"IANA Allocations for Pseudo Wire Edge To Edge Emulation (PWE3),"'>RFC4446</a>].  IANA has set aside the following Pseudowire Interface

      Length
         &gt;= 14

         The length may be increased if the presence of additional
         parameters is indicated by additional suboptions.

      IP-Compression-Protocol
         0061 (hex)

      TCP_SPACE
         The TCP_SPACE field is two octets and indicates the maximum
         value of a context identifier in the space of context
         identifiers allocated for TCP.

            Suggested value: 15

         TCP_SPACE must be at least 0 and at most 255 (the value 0
         implies having one context).  This field is not used for CRTP
         (PW type 0x001B) and ECRTP (PW type 0x001B) PWs.  For these PW
         types, it should be set to its suggested value by the sender
         and ignored by the receiver.

      NON_TCP_SPACE
         The NON_TCP_SPACE field is two octets and indicates the maximum
         value of a context identifier in the space of context
         identifiers allocated for non-TCP.  These context identifiers
         are carried in COMPRESSED_NON_TCP, COMPRESSED_UDP and
         COMPRESSED_RTP packet headers.

            Suggested value: 15

         NON_TCP_SPACE must be at least 0 and at most 65535 (the value 0
         implies having one context).

      F_MAX_PERIOD
         Maximum interval between full headers.  No more than
         F_MAX_PERIOD COMPRESSED_NON_TCP headers may be sent between
         FULL_HEADER headers.

            Suggested value: 256

         A value of zero implies infinity, i.e., there is no limit to
         the number of consecutive COMPRESSED_NON_TCP headers.  This
         field is not used for CRTP (PW type 0x001B) and ECRTP (PW type
         0x001B) PWs.  For these PW types, it should be set to its
         suggested value by the sender and ignored by the receiver.

      F_MAX_TIME
         Maximum time interval between full headers.  COMPRESSED_NON_TCP
         headers may not be sent more than F_MAX_TIME seconds after
         sending the last FULL_HEADER header.

         Suggested value: 5 seconds

         A value of zero implies infinity.  This field is not used for
         CRTP (PW type 0x001B) and ECRTP (PW type 0x001B) PWs.  For
         these PW types, it should be set to its suggested value by the
         sender and ignored by the receiver.

      MAX_HEADER
         The largest header size in octets that may be compressed.

         Suggested value: 168 octets

         The value of MAX_HEADER should be large enough so that at least
         the outer network layer header can be compressed.  To increase
         compression efficiency MAX_HEADER should be set to a value
         large enough to cover common combinations of network and
         transport layer headers.

      suboptions
         The suboptions field consists of zero or more suboptions.  Each
         suboption consists of a type field, a length field and zero or
         more parameter octets, as defined by the suboption type.  The
         value of the length field indicates the length of the suboption
         in its entirety, including the lengths of the type and length
         fields.

   To use the enhanced RTP HC defined in [<a href="rfc3545.html" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers on Links with High Delay, Packet Loss, and Reordering,"'>RFC3545</a>], a new suboption 2 is

   and MUST NOT be included for other PW types.

   Note that suboption 1 refers to the RTP-Compression Suboption, as

   In [<a href="rfc3544.html" title='"IP Header Compression over PPP,"'>RFC3544</a>] it was not possible to negotiate only TCP HC or only
   non-TCP HC because a value of 0 in the TCP_SPACE or the NON_TCP_SPACE
   fields actually means that 1 context is negotiated.

   A new suboption 3 is added to allow specifying that the number of
   contexts for TCP_SPACE or NON_TCP_SPACE is zero, disabling use of the
   corresponding compression.  This suboption MUST be included for IPHC
   PWs (0x001C) and MUST NOT be included for other PW types.

   MRRU
      The MRRU field is two octets and indicates the maximum
      reconstructed reception unit (see [<a href="#ref-RFC3095bis" title='"The RObust Header Compression (ROHC) Framework"'>RFC3095bis</a>], Section 5.1.2).

      Suggested value: 0

   MAX_HEADER
      The largest header size in octets that may be compressed.

            Suggested value: 168 octets

      The value of MAX_HEADER should be large enough so that at least
      the outer network layer header can be compressed.  To increase
      compression efficiency MAX_HEADER should be set to a value large
      enough to cover common combinations of network and transport layer
      headers.

      NOTE: The four ROHC profiles defined in <a href="rfc3095.html">RFC 3095</a> do not provide
      for a MAX_HEADER parameter.  The parameter MAX_HEADER defined by
      this document is therefore without consequence in these profiles
      because the maximum compressible header size is unspecified.
      Other profiles (e.g., ones based on <a href="rfc2507.html">RFC 2507</a>) can make use of the
      parameter by explicitly referencing it.

   suboptions
      The suboptions field consists of zero or more suboptions.  Each
      suboption consists of a type field, a length field, and zero or
      more parameter octets, as defined by the suboption type.  The
      value of the length field indicates the length of the suboption in
      its entirety, including the lengths of the type and length fields.

   11-15: Not yet assigned.  (See <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>, "IANA Considerations",
          for discussion of the registration rules.)

   As discussed in [<a href="#ref-ECMP-AVOID" title='"Avoiding Equal Cost Multipath Treatment in MPLS Networks"'>ECMP-AVOID</a>], since this MPLS payload type is not IP,
   the first nibble is set to 0000 to avoid being mistaken for IP.  This
   is also consistent with the encoding of the PW MPLS control word
   (PWMCW) described in [<a href="rfc4385.html" title='"Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Control Word for Use over an MPLS PSN,"'>RFC4385</a>]; however, the HC control parameter is
   not intended to be a PWMCW.

   Note that ROHC [<a href="rfc3095.html" title='"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): Framework and four profiles: RTP, UDP, ESP, and uncompressed"'>RFC3095</a>, <a href="#ref-RFC3095bis" title='"The RObust Header Compression (ROHC) Framework"'>RFC3095bis</a>] provides its own packet type
   within the protocol; however, the HC control parameter MUST still be
   used to avoid the problems identified above.  Since the "Packet Type"
   will be there anyway, it is used to indicate ROHC CID size, in the
   same way as with PPP.

   The HC control parameter length field is ONLY used for short packets
   because padding may be appended by the Ethernet Data Link Layer.  If
   the length is greater than or equal to 64 octets, the length field
   MUST be set to zero.  If the MPLS payload is less than 64 bytes, then
   the length field MUST be set to the length of the PW payload plus the
   length of the HC control parameter.  Note that the last 2 bits in the
   HC control parameter are reserved.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20Packet%20Reordering"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Packet Reordering</span>

   Packet reordering for ROHC is discussed in [<a href="rfc4224.html" title='"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): ROHC over Channels that can Reorder Packets,"'>RFC4224</a>], which is a
   useful source of information.  In case of lossy links and other
   reasons for reordering, implementation adaptations are needed to
   allow all the schemes to be used in this case.  Although CRTP is
   viewed as having risks for a number of PW environments due to
   reordering and loss, it is still the protocol of choice in many
   cases.  CRTP was designed for reliable point to point links with
   short delays.  It does not perform well over links with a high rate
   of packet loss, packet reordering, and long delays.  In such cases,
   ECRTP [<a href="rfc3545.html" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers on Links with High Delay, Packet Loss, and Reordering,"'>RFC3545</a>] may be considered to increase robustness to both
   packet loss and misordering between the compressor and the
   decompressor.  This is achieved by repeating updates and sending of
   absolute (uncompressed) values in addition to delta values for
   selected context parameters.  IPHC should use TCP_NODELTA, ECRTP
   should send absolute values, ROHC should be adapted as discussed in
   [<a href="rfc4224.html" title='"RObust Header Compression (ROHC): ROHC over Channels that can Reorder Packets,"'>RFC4224</a>].  An evaluation and simulation of ECRTP and ROHC reordering
   is given in [<a href="#ref-REORDER-EVAL" title='"Evaluation and Implementation of Header Compression Algorithm ECRTP"'>REORDER-EVAL</a>].

   This example will trace the setup of an MPLS PW supporting bi-
   directional ECRTP [<a href="rfc3545.html" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers on Links with High Delay, Packet Loss, and Reordering,"'>RFC3545</a>] traffic.  The example assumes the
   topology shown in Figure 1.  The PW will be set up between LSRs R1/HC
   and R4/HD.  LSRs R2 and R3 have no direct involvement in the
   signaling for this PW, other than to transport the signaling traffic.

   For this example, it is assumed that R1/HC has already obtained the
   IP address of R4/HD used for LDP signaling, and vice versa, that both
   R1/HC and R4/HD have been configured with the same 32-bit PW ID, as
   described in <a href="rfc4447.html#section-5.2">Section 5.2 of [RFC4447]</a>, and that R1/HC has been
   configured to initiate the LDP discovery process.  Furthermore, we
   assume that R1/HC has been configured to receive a maximum of 200
   simultaneous ECRTP flows from R4/HD, and R4/HD has been configured to
   receive a maximum of 255 ECRTP flows from R1/HC.

   Assuming that there is no existing LDP session between R1/HC and
   R4/HD, the PW signaling must start by setting up an LDP session
   between them.  As described earlier in this document, LDP extended
   discovery is used between HC over MPLS LSRs.  Since R1/HC has been
   configured to initiate extended discovery, it will send LDP Targeted
   Hello messages to R4/HD's IP address at UDP port 646.  The Targeted
   Hello messages sent by R1/HC will have the "R" bit set in the Common
   Hello Parameters TLV, requesting R4/HD to send Targeted Hello
   messages back to R1/HC.  Since R4/HD has been configured to set up an
   HC PW with R1/HD, R4/HD will do as requested and send LDP Targeted
   Hello messages as unicast UDP packets to UDP port 646 of R1/HC's IP
   address.

   When R1/HC receives a Targeted Hello message from R4/HD, it may begin
   establishing an LDP session to R4/HD.  It starts this by initiating a
   TCP connection on port 646 to R4/HD's signaling IP address.  After
   successful TCP connection establishment, R1/HC sends an LDP
   Initialization message to R4/HD with the following characteristics:

   When R1/HC receives a Targeted Hello message from R4/HD, it may begin
   establishing an LDP session to R4/HD.  The procedure described in
   <a href="rfc3036.html#section-2.5.2">Section 2.5.2 of [RFC3036]</a> is used to determine which LSR is the
   active LSR and which is the passive LSR.  Assume that R1/HC has the
   numerically higher IP address and therefore takes the active role.
   R1/HC starts by initiating a TCP connection on port 646 to R4/HD's
   signaling IP address.  After successful TCP connection establishment,
   R1/HC sends an LDP Initialization message to R4/HD with the following
   characteristics:

   o Common Session Parameters TLV:
     - A bit = 0 (Downstream Unsolicited Mode)
     - D bit = 0 (Loop Detection Disabled)
     - PVLim = 0 (required when D bit = 0)
     - Receive LDP identifier (taken from R4/HD's Hello message)
       &gt; 4 octets LSR identifier (typically an IP address with IPv4)
       &gt; 2 octet Label space identifier (typically 0)
   o No Optional Parameters TLV

   Following the LDP session initialization state machine of <a href="rfc3036.html#section-2.5.4">Section</a>
   <a href="rfc3036.html#section-2.5.4">2.5.4 of [RFC3036]</a>, R4/HD would send a similar Initialization message
   to R1/HD.  The primary difference would be that R4/HD would use the
   LDP identifier it received in R1/HC's Hello message(s) as the Receive
   LDP identifier.  Assuming that all other fields in the Common Session
   Parameters TLV were acceptable to both sides, R1/HC would send an LDP
   Keepalive message to R4/HD, R4/HD would send a LDP Keepalive message
   to R1/HC, and the LDP session would become operational.

   At this point, either R1/HC or R4/HD may send LDP Label Mapping
   messages to configure the PW.  The Label Mapping message sent by a
   particular router advertises the label that should be used at the
   bottom of the MPLS label stack for all packets sent to that router
   and associated with the particular PW.  The Label Mapping message
   sent from R1/HC to R4/HD would have the following characteristics:

   o FEC TLV
     - FEC Element type 0x80 (PWid FEC Element, as defined in [<a href="rfc4447.html" title='"Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)"'>RFC4447</a>]

   The Label Mapping message sent from R4/HD to R1/HC would be almost
   identical to the one sent in the opposite direction, with the
   following exceptions:

   o R4/HD could select a different Group ID
   o The Value of NON_TCP_SPACE in the CRTP/ECRTP/IPHC HC over MPLS
     configuration sub-TLV would be 255 instead of 200, as configured
     on R4/HD
   o R4/HD would choose its own value for the Label TLV, Lr4

   As soon as either R1/HC or R4/HD has both transmitted and received
   Label Mapping Messages with the same PW Type and PW ID, that HC
   endpoint considers the PW established.  R1/HC could send ECRTP
   packets using the label it received in the Label Mapping Message from
   R4/HD, Lr4, and could identify received ECRTP packets by the label it
   had sent to R4/HD, Lr1.  And vice versa.

   In this case, assume that R1/HC has an IPv4 RTP flow to send to R4/HD
   that it wishes to compress using the ECRTP PW just set up.  The RTP
   flow is G.729 media with 20 bytes of payload in each RTP packet.  In
   this particular case, the IPv4 identifier changes by a small constant
   value between consecutive packets in the stream.  In the RTP layer of
   the flow, the Contributing Source Identifiers count is 0.  R1/HC
   decides to use 8-bit Context Identifiers for the compressed flow.
   Also, R1/HC determines that compression in this particular flow
   should be able to recover from the loss of 2 consecutive packets
   without requiring re-synchronization of the context (i.e., the "N"
   value from [<a href="rfc3545.html" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers on Links with High Delay, Packet Loss, and Reordering,"'>RFC3545</a>] is 2).

   The first 3 (N + 1) packets of this flow would be sent as FULL_HEADER
   packets.  The MPLS and PW headers at the beginning of these packets
   would be formatted as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Immediately following the above header would come the FULL_HEADER
   packet as defined in [<a href="rfc3545.html" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers on Links with High Delay, Packet Loss, and Reordering,"'>RFC3545</a>], which basically consists of the
   IP/UDP/RTP header, with the IP and UDP length field replaced by
   values encoding the CID, sequence number, and "generation", as
   defined in [<a href="rfc3545.html" title='"Compressing IP/UDP/RTP Headers on Links with High Delay, Packet Loss, and Reordering,"'>RFC3545</a>].  The length field value of 62 comprises:

   o 2 bytes of HC control parameter (included in the above diagram)
   o 20 bytes of the IP header portion of the <a href="rfc3545.html">RFC 3545</a> FULL_HEADER
   o 8 bytes of the UDP header portion of the <a href="rfc3545.html">RFC 3545</a> FULL_HEADER
   o 12 bytes of the RTP header portion of the <a href="rfc3545.html">RFC 3545</a> FULL_HEADER
   o 20 bytes of G.729 payload

   The next 3 RTP packets from this flow would be sent as
   COMPRESSED_UDP_8, to establish the absolute and delta values of the
   IPv4 identifier and RTP timestamp fields.  These packets would use
   the same ECRTP CID as the previous 3 FULL_HEADER packets.  The MPLS
   and PW headers at the beginning of these packets would be formatted
   as follows:

   There is no change in the MPLS label stack between the FULL_HEADER
   packets and the COMPRESSED_UDP packets.  The HC control parameter
   changes to reflect another ECRTP packet type following the control
   parameter, and a change of packet length.  The length changes because
   the new packet type more compactly encodes the headers.  The length
   field value of 36 comprises:

   o 2 bytes of HC control parameter (included in the above diagram)
   o 1 byte of CID
   o 2 bytes of COMPRESSED_UDP fields that are not octet-aligned:
     - 4 bits of COMPRESSED_UDP flags
     - 4 bits of sequence number
     - 5 bits of COMPRESSED UDP extension flags
     - 3 bits MUST_BE_ZERO
   o 2 bytes of UDP checksum or HDRCKSUM
   o 1 byte of delta IPv4 ID
   o 2 bytes of delta RTP timestamp (changes by 160 in this case,
       differential encoding will encode as 2 bytes)
   o 2 bytes of absolute IPv4 ID
   o 4 bytes of absolute RTP timestamp
   o 20 bytes of G.729 payload

   After the context for the IPv4 ID and RTP timestamp is initialized.
   Subsequent packets on this flow, at least until the end of the talk
   spurt or until there is some other unexpected change in the
   IP/UDP/RTP headers, may be sent as COMPRESSED_RTP_8 packets.  Again,
   the same MPLS stack would be used for these packets, and the same
   value of the CID would be used in this case as for the packets
   described above.  The MPLS and PW headers at the beginning of these
   packets would be formatted as follows:

   The HC control parameter again changes to reflect another ECRTP
   packet type following the control parameter, and shorter length
   associated with an even more compact encoding of headers.  The length
   field value of 26 comprises:

   o 2 bytes of HC control parameter (included in the above diagram)
   o 1 byte of CID
   o 1 byte COMPRESSED_UDP fields that are not octet-aligned:
     - 4 bits of COMPRESSED_RTP flags
     - 4 bits of sequence number
   o 2 bytes of UDP checksum or HDRCKSUM
   o 20 bytes of G.729 payload

   Additional flows in the same direction may be compressed using the
   same basic encapsulation, including the same PW label.  The CID that
   is part of the HC protocol is used to differentiate flows.  For
   traffic in the opposite direction, the primary change would be the PW
   label, Lr4, used in the example above would be replaced by the label
   Lr1 that R1/HC provides to R4/HD.
