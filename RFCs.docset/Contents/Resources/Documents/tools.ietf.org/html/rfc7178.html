<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   RBridge campuses provide transparent least-cost forwarding using the
   Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol that
   builds on Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing
   [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Intermediate System to Intermediate System intra-domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>] [<a href="rfc1195.html" title='"Use of OSI IS-IS for routing in TCP/IP and dual environments"'>RFC1195</a>] [<a href="rfc7176.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Use of IS-IS"'>RFC7176</a>].  Devices that implement TRILL are called
   Routing Bridges (RBridges) or TRILL Switches.  However, the TRILL
   base protocol standard [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>] provides only for TRILL Data
   messages and TRILL IS-IS messages.

   This document specifies a general channel mechanism for the
   transmission of other messages within an RBridge campus, such as BFD
   [<a href="rfc5880.html" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>] messages, (1) between RBridges and end stations that are
   directly connected on the same link and (2) between RBridges.  This
   mechanism supports a requirement to be able to operate with minimal
   configuration.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20RBridge%20Channel%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  RBridge Channel Requirements</span>

   It is anticipated that various protocols operating at the TRILL layer
   will be desired in RBridge campuses.  For example, there is a need
   for rapid-response continuity checking with a protocol such as BFD
   [<a href="rfc5880.html" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>] [<a href="rfc5882.html" title='"Generic Application of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5882</a>] and for a variety of optional reporting.

   To avoid the requirement to design and specify a way to carry each
   such protocol, this document specifies a general channel for sending
   messages between RBridges in a campus at the TRILL level by extending
   the TRILL protocol.  To accommodate a wide variety of protocols, this
   RBridge Channel facility accommodates all the regular modes of TRILL
   Data transmission including single- and multiple-hop unicast as well
   as VLAN-scoped multi-destination distribution.

   To minimize any unnecessary burden on transit RBridges and to provide
   a more realistic test of network continuity and the like, RBridge
   Channel messages are designed to look like TRILL Data frames and, in
   the case of multi-hop messages, can normally be handled by transit
   RBridges as if they were TRILL Data frames; however, to enable
   processing at transit RBridges when required by particular messages,
   they may optionally use the RBridge Channel Alert TRILL extended
   header flags [<a href="rfc7179.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Header Extension"'>RFC7179</a>] that causes a transit RBridge implementing the
   flag to more closely examine a flagged frame.

   This document also specifies a format for sending RBridge Channel
   messages between RBridges and end stations that are directly
   connected over a link, in either direction, when provided for by the

   The RBridge Channel is similar to the MPLS Generic Associated Channel
   specified in [<a href="rfc5586.html" title='"MPLS Generic Associated Channel"'>RFC5586</a>].  Instead of using a special MPLS label to
   indicate a special channel message, an RBridge Channel message is
   indicated by a special multicast Inner.MacDA and inner Ethertype (see
   <a href="#section-2.1">Section 2.1</a>).

   Channel messages between RBridges are transmitted as TRILL Data
   frames.  (For information on channel messages that can be transmitted
   between RBridges and end stations that are directly connected by a
   link, see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.)  Inter-RBridge Channel messages are identified
   as such by their Inner.MacDA, which is the All-Egress-RBridges
   multicast address, together with their inner Ethertype, which is the
   RBridge-Channel Ethertype.  This Ethertype is part of and starts the
   RBridge Channel Header.

   Optionally, some channel messages may require examination of the
   frame by transit RBridges that support the RBridge Channel feature,
   to determine if they need to take any action.  To indicate this, such
   messages use an RBridge Channel Alert extended TRILL Header flag as
   further described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> below.

   Sections <a href="#section-2.1">2.1</a> and <a href="#section-2.2">2.2</a> describe the inner frame and the TRILL Header
   for frames sent in an RBridge Channel.  As always, the outer Link
   Header and Link Trailer are whatever is needed to get a TRILL Data
   frame to the next-hop RBridge, depending on the technology of the
   link, and can change with each hop for multi-hop messages.  <a href="#section-2.3">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-2.3">2.3</a> describes the outer Link Header for Ethernet links, and <a href="#section-2.4">Section</a>

   The special Inner.MacDA is the All-Egress-RBridges multicast Media
   Access Control (MAC) address to signal that the frame is intended for
   the egress (decapsulating) RBridge itself (or the egress RBridges
   themselves if the frame is multi-destination).  (This address is
   called the All-ESADI-RBridges address in [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>].)  The RBridge-
   Channel Ethertype indicates that the frame is an RBridge Channel
   message.  The only other Ethertype currently specified for use with
   the All-Egress-RBridges Inner.MacDA is L2-IS-IS to indicate an ESADI
   frame [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>].  In the future, additional Ethertypes may be
   specified for use with the All-Egress-RBridges multicast address.

   The RBridge originating the channel message selects the Inner.MacSA.
   The Inner.MacSA MUST be set by the originating RBridge to a MAC
   address unique within the campus owned by the originating RBridge.
   This MAC address can be considered, in effect, the MAC address of a
   virtual internal end station that handles the RBridge Channel frames
   originated by or destined for that RBridge.  It MAY be the same as
   the Inner.MacSA used by the RBridge when it originates ESADI frames
   [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.3.%20%20Inner.VLAN%20Tag"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.3" name="section-2.1.3">2.1.3</a>.  Inner.VLAN Tag</span>

   As with all frames formatted to be processed as a TRILL Data frame,
   an Inner.VLAN tag is present.  Use of a VLAN tag Ethertype other than
   0x8100 or stacked tags is beyond the scope of this document but is an
   obvious extension.

   Multi-destination RBridge Channel messages are, like all multi-
   destination TRILL Data messages, VLAN scoped so the Inner.VLAN ID
   MUST be set to the VLAN of interest.  To the extent that distribution
   tree pruning is in effect in the campus, such channel messages may
   only reach RBridges advertising that they have connectivity to that
   VLAN.

   For channel messages sent as known unicast TRILL Data frames, the
   default value for the Inner.VLAN ID is VLAN 1, but particular RBridge
   Channel protocols MAY specify other values.

   The Inner.VLAN also specifies a three-bit frame priority for which
   the following recommendations apply:

   1.  For one-hop channel messages critical to network connectivity,
       such as one-hop BFD for rapid link-failure detection in support
       of TRILL IS-IS, the RECOMMENDED priority is 7.

   2.  For single and multi-hop unicast channel messages important to
       network operation but not critical for connectivity, the
       RECOMMENDED priority is 6.

   3.  For other unicast channel messages and all multi-destination
       channel messages, it is RECOMMENDED that the default priority
       zero be used.  In any case, priorities higher than 5 SHOULD NOT
       be used for such frames.

   There is one additional bit in a VLAN tag value between the 12-bit
   VLAN ID and 3-bit priority, the Drop Eligibility Indicator (DEI)
   [<a href="rfc7180.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Clarifications, Corrections, and Updates"'>RFC7180</a>].  It is RECOMMENDED that this bit be zero for the first two
   categories of channel messages listed immediately above.  The setting
   of this bit for channel messages in the third category may be
   dependent on the channel protocol and no general recommendation is
   made for that case.

   After the outer Link Header (that, for an Ethernet link, ends with
   the TRILL Ethertype) and before the encapsulated frame, the channel
   message's TRILL Header initially appears as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

              Figure 4: RBridge Channel TRILL Header Fields

   The TRILL Header version (V) MUST be zero; the R bits are reserved;
   the M bit is set appropriately as the channel message is to be
   forwarded as known destination unicast (M=0) or multi-destination
   (M=1), regardless of the fact that the Inner.MacDA is always the All-
   Egress-RBridges multicast address; and Op-Len is set appropriately
   for the length of the TRILL Header extensions area, if any, all as
   specified in [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>].

   When an RBridge Channel message is originated, the Hop Count field
   defaults to the maximum value, 0x3F, but particular RBridge Channel
   protocols MAY specify other values.  For messages sent a known number
   of hops, such as one-hop messages or a two-hop self-addressed message
   intended to loop back through an immediate neighbor RBridge, setting
   the Hop Count field in the TRILL Header to the maximum value and
   checking its value on receipt provides an additional validity check

   as discussed in [<a href="rfc5082.html" title='"The Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)"'>RFC5082</a>], where this type of field is referred to as
   "TTL" or "Hop Limit".

   The RBridge originating a channel message places a nickname that it
   holds in the Ingress Nickname field.

   There are several cases for the Egress Nickname field.  If the
   channel message is multi-destination, then the Egress Nickname
   designates the distribution tree to use.  If the channel message is a
   multi-hop unicast message, then the Egress Nickname is a nickname of
   the target RBridge; this includes the special case of a message
   intended to loop back from an immediate neighbor where the originator
   places one of its own nicknames in both the Ingress Nickname and
   Egress Nickname fields.  If the channel message is a one-hop unicast
   message, there are two possibilities for the Egress Nickname.

   o  The Egress Nickname can be set to a nickname of the target
      neighbor RBridge.

   o  The special nickname Any-RBridge may be used.  RBridges supporting
      the RBridge Channel facility MUST recognize the Any-RBridge
      special nickname and accept TRILL Data frames having that value in
      the Egress Nickname field as being sent to them as the egress.
      Thus, for such RBridges, using this egress nickname guarantees
      processing by an immediate neighbor regardless of the state of
      nicknames.

   An RBridge Channel frame has the usual Link Header and Link Trailer
   for a TRILL Data frame depending on the type of link on which it is
   sent.

   For an Ethernet link [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>], the Outer.MacSA is the MAC address of
   the port from which the frame is sent.  The Outer.MacDA is the MAC
   address of the next-hop RBridge port for unicast RBridge Channel
   messages or the All-RBridges multicast address for multi-destination
   RBridge Channel messages.  The Outer.VLAN tag specifies the
   designated VLAN for that hop, and the priority should be the same as
   in the Inner.VLAN tag; however, the output port may have been
   configured to strip VLAN tags, in which case no Outer.VLAN tag
   appears on the wire.  And the Link Trailer is the Ethernet FCS.

   RBridge Channel messages over a link that is not yet fully up.  In
   particular, it is permissible, if specified by the particular channel
   protocol, for the source RBridge that has created an RBridge Channel
   message to attempt to transmit it to a next-hop RBridge when the link
   is in the Detect or 2-Way state, as specified in [<a href="rfc7177.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Adjacency"'>RFC7177</a>], as well
   as when it is in the Report state.  Such messages can also be sent on
   point-to-point links that are not in the Up state.

   RBridge Channel messages represent a burden on the RBridges, and
   links in a campus and should be rate limited, especially if they are
   sent as high priority, multi-destination, or multi-hop frames or have
   an RBridge Channel Alert extended header flag set.  See <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>,
   "Congestion Considerations".

   RBridge Channel TRILL Data messages are designed to look like and, to
   the extent practical, be forwarded as regular TRILL Data frames.  On
   receiving a channel message, an RBridge performs the usual initial
   tests on the frame and makes the same forwarding and/or decapsulation
   decisions as for a regular TRILL Data frame [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>] with the
   following exceptions for RBridges implementing the RBridge Channel
   facility:

   1.  An RBridge implementing the RBridge Channel facility MUST
       recognize the Any-RBridge egress nickname in TRILL Data frames,
       decapsulating such frames if they meet other checks.  (Such a
       frame cannot be a valid multi-destination frame because the Any-
       RBridge nickname is not a valid distribution tree root.)

   2.  If an RBridge Channel Alert extended header flag is set, then the
       RBridge MUST process the RBridge Channel message as described
       below even if it is not egressing the frame.  If it is egressing
       the frame, then no additional processing beyond egress processing
       is needed even if an RBridge Channel Alert flag is set.

   3.  On decapsulation, the special Inner.MacDA value of All-Egress-
       RBridges MUST be recognized to trigger checking the
       Inner.Ethertype and processing as an RBridge Channel message if
       that Ethertype is RBridge-Channel.

   RBridge Channel messages SHOULD only be sent to RBridges that
   advertise support for the channel protocol involved as described in
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

   All RBridges supporting the RBridge Channel facility MUST recognize
   the RBridge-Channel inner Ethertype.

   Knowing that it has an RBridge Channel message, the egress RBridge,
   and any transit RBridge if an RBridge Channel Alert bit is set in the
   TRILL Header, looks at the CHV (RBridge Channel Header Version) and
   Channel Protocol fields.

   If any of the following conditions occur at an egress RBridge, the
   frame is not processed, an error may be generated as specified in
   <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>, and the frame is discarded.  The behavior is the same if
   the frame is being processed at a transit RBridge because the RBridge
   Critical Channel Alert flag is set [<a href="rfc7179.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Header Extension"'>RFC7179</a>].  However, if these
   conditions are detected at a transit RBridge examining the message
   because the RBridge Non-critical Channel Alert flag is set [<a href="rfc7179.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL): Header Extension"'>RFC7179</a>]
   but the RBridge Critical Channel Alert flag is not set, no error is
   generated, and the frame is still forwarded normally.

   Error Conditions:

   1.  The Ethertype is not RBridge-Channel and not any other Ethertype
       known to the RBridge as usable with the All-Egress-RBridges
       Inner.MacDA, or the frame is so short that the Ethertype is
       truncated.

   2.  The CHV field is non-zero, or the frame is so short that the
       version zero Channel Header is truncated.

   3.  The Channel Protocol field is a reserved value or a value unknown
       to the processing RBridge.

   4.  The ERR field is non-zero, and Channel Protocol is a value other
       than 0x001.

   5.  The RBridge Channel Header NA flag is set to one, indicating that
       the frame should have been received as a native frame rather than
       a TRILL Data frame.

   If the CHV field and NA flag are zero and the processing RBridge
   recognizes the Channel Protocol value, it processes the message in
   accordance with that channel protocol.  The processing model is as if
   the received frame starting with and including the TRILL Header is

   delivered to the Channel protocol along with a flag indicating
   whether this is (a) transit RBridge processing due to an RBridge
   Channel Alert flag being set or (b) egress processing.

   Errors within a recognized Channel Protocol are handled by that
   channel protocol itself and do not produce RBridge Channel Error
   frames.

   A variety of problems at the RBridge Channel level cause the return
   of an RBridge Channel Error frame unless one of the following apply:
   (a) the "SL" (Silent) flag is a one in the channel message for which
   the problem was detected, (b) the processing is due to the RBridge
   Non-critical Channel Alert flag being set, (c) the frame in error
   appears, itself, to be an RBridge Channel Error frame (has a non-zero
   ERR field or a Channel Protocol of 0x001), or (d) the error is
   suppressed due to rate limiting.

   An RBridge Channel Error frame is a multi-hop unicast RBridge Channel
   message with the Ingress Nickname set to a nickname of the RBridge
   detecting the error and the Egress Nickname set to the value of the
   Ingress Nickname in the channel message for which the error was
   detected.  No per-hop transit processing is specified for such error
   frames, so the RBridge Channel Alert extended header flags SHOULD, if
   an extension is present, be set to zero.  The SL and MH flags SHOULD
   be set to one; the NA flag MUST be zero; and the ERR field MUST be
   non-zero as described below.  For the protocol-specific data area, an
   RBridge Channel Message Error frame has at least the first 256 bytes
   (or less if less are available) of the erroneous decapsulated channel
   message starting with the TRILL Header.  (Note: The TRILL Header does
   not include the TRILL Ethertype that is part of the Link Header on
   Ethernet links.)

   The following values for ERR are specified:

   All RBridges implementing the RBridge Channel feature MUST recognize
   the RBridge Channel Error protocol value (0x001).  They MUST NOT
   generate an RBridge Channel Error message in response to an RBridge
   Channel Error message, that is, a channel message with a protocol
   value of 0x001 or with a non-zero ERR field.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Native%20RBridge%20Channel%20Frames"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Native RBridge Channel Frames</span>

   Other sections of this document specify non-native RBridge Channel
   messages and their processing, that is, RBridge Channel messages
   formatted as TRILL Data frames and sent between RBridges.  This
   section specifies the differences for native RBridge Channel
   messages.

   If provided for by the channel protocol involved, native RBridge
   Channel messages may be sent between end stations and RBridges that
   are directly connected over a link, in either direction.  On an
   Ethernet link, such native frames have the RBridge-Channel Ethertype
   and are like the encapsulated frame inside an RBridge Channel message
   except as follows:

   1.  TRILL does not require the presence of a VLAN tag on such native
       RBridge Channel frames.  However, port configuration, link
       characteristics, or the channel protocol involved may require
       such tagging.

   2.  If the frame is unicast, the destination MAC address is the
       unicast MAC address of the RBridge or end-station port that is
       its intended destination.  If the frame is multicast by an end
       station to all the RBridges on a link that support an RBridge
       Channel protocol using this transport, the destination MAC
       address is the All-Edge-RBridges multicast address (see <a href="#section-7">Section</a>
       <a href="#section-7">7</a>).  A native RBridge Channel frame received at an ingress
       RBridge is discarded if its destination MAC address is neither
       the unicast address of the port nor the multicast address All-
       Edge-RBridges.  If the frame is multicast by an RBridge to all
       the devices that TRILL considers to be end stations on a link and
       that support an RBridge Channel protocol using this transport,
       the destination MAC address is the TRILL-End-Stations multicast
       address (see <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>).  A native RBridge Channel frame received
       at an end station is discarded if its destination MAC address is
       neither the unicast address of the port nor the multicast address
       TRILL-End-Stations.

   3.  The RBridge-Channel outer Ethertype must be present.  In the
       future, there may be other protocols using the All-Edge-RBridges
       and/or TRILL-End-Stations multicast addresses on native frames
       distinguished by different Ethertypes.

   4.  The NA or Native bit in the RBridge Channel Header flags MUST be
       a one.

   5.  There might be additional tags present between the Outer.MacDA,
       Outer.MacSA pair, and the RBridge-Channel Ethertype.

   The RBridge Channel protocol number space for native RBridge Channel
   messages and TRILL Data formatted RBridge Channel messages is the
   same.  If provided for by the channel protocol involved, the receipt
   of a native RBridge Channel frame MAY lead to the generation and
   transmission of one or more Inter-RBridge Channel frames.  The
   decapsulation and processing of a TRILL Data RBridge Channel frame
   MAY, if provided for by the channel protocol involved, result in the
   sending of one or more native RBridge Channel frames to one or more
   end stations.  Thus, there could be an RBridge Channel protocol that
   involved an RBridge Channel message sent (1) from an origin RBridge
   where the message is created, (2) through one or more transit
   RBridges, and (3) from a final RBridge as a native RBridge Channel
   message to an end station (or the reverse of such a three-part path);
   however, to do this, the RBridge Channel protocol involved must be
   implemented at the RBridge where the channel message is changed
   between a native frame and a TRILL Data format frame, and that
   RBridge must change the channel message itself, at a minimum
   complementing the NA flag in the Channel Header and making
   appropriate MAC address changes.

   An erroneous native channel message results in a native RBridge
   Channel Error message under the same conditions for which a TRILL
   Data RBridge Channel message would result in a TRILL Data RBridge
   Channel Error message.  However, in a native RBridge Channel Error
   message, the NA flag MUST be one.  Also, since there is no TRILL
   Header in native RBridge Channel protocol frames, the beginning part
   of the frame in which the error was detected that is included in
   native RBridge Channel Error frames starts with the RBridge Channel
   Header (including the RBridge-Channel Ethertype).  The destination
   MAC address of such error messages is set to the source MAC address
   of the native RBridge Channel message that was in error.

   There is no mechanism to stop end stations from directly exchanging
   native RBridge Channel messages, but such usage is beyond the scope
   of this document.

   Support for RBridge Channel protocols is indicated by the presence of
   one or more TLVs and/or sub-TLVs in an RBridge's Link State PDU (LSP)
   as documented in [<a href="rfc7176.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Use of IS-IS"'>RFC7176</a>].

   RBridge Channel protocols 0 and 0xFFF are reserved, and protocol 1,
   the RBridge Channel Error protocol, MUST be implemented as part of
   the RBridge Channel feature.  Thus, if an RBridge supports the
   RBridge Channel feature, it should be advertising support for
   protocol 1 and not advertising support for protocols 0 or 0xFFF in
   its LSP.  However, indication of support or non-support for RBridge
   Channel protocol 1 is ignored on receipt, and support for it is
   always assumed if support for any RBridge Channel is indicated in the
   RBridge's LSP.

   The bandwidth resources used by RBridge Channel protocols are
   recommended to be small compared to the total bandwidth of the links
   they traverse.  When doing network planning, the bandwidth
   requirements for TRILL Data, TRILL IS-IS, TRILL ESADI, RBridge
   Channel protocol traffic, and any other link-local traffic need to be
   taken into account.

   Specifications for particular RBridge Channel protocols MUST consider
   congestion and bandwidth usage implications and provide guidance on
   bandwidth or packet-frequency management.  RBridge Channel protocols
   can have built-in bandwidth management in their protocols.  Outgoing
   channel messages SHOULD be rate-limited, by configuring the
   underlying protocols or otherwise, to prevent aggressive connectivity
   verification or other applications consuming excessive bandwidth,
   causing congestion, or becoming denial-of-service attacks.

   If these conditions cannot be followed, an adaptive loss-based scheme
   SHOULD be applied to congestion-control outgoing RBridge Channel
   traffic, so that it competes fairly, taking into account packet
   priorities and drop eligibility as indicated in the Inner.VLAN, with
   TCP or similar traffic within an order of magnitude.  One method of
   determining an acceptable bandwidth for RBridge Channel traffic is
   described in [<a href="rfc5348.html" title='"TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification"'>RFC5348</a>]; other methods exist.  For example, bandwidth
   or packet-frequency management can include any of the following: a
   negotiation of transmission interval/rate such as that provided in
   BFD [<a href="rfc5880.html" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>], a throttled transmission rate on "congestion detected"
   situations, a gradual ramp-up after shutdown due to congestion and
   until basic connectivity is verified, and other mechanisms.

   Connectivity-checking applications such as BFD [<a href="rfc5880.html" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)"'>RFC5880</a>] SHOULD be
   rate-limited to below 5% of the bitrate of the associated link or
   links.  For this purpose, the mean or sustained bitrate of the link
   or links is used.

   Incoming RBridge Channel messages MAY be rate-limited as a protection
   against denial-of-service attacks.  This throttling of incoming
   messages SHOULD honor packet priorities and drop eligibility
   indications as indicated in the Inner.VLAN, preferentially discarding
   drop-eligible and lower-priority packets.

   question.  If a particular RBridge Channel protocol is incorrectly
   not advertised as supported, it could deny the service of that
   channel protocol to the RBridge in question.

   Incorrect indication of RBridge Channel Protocol support or incorrect
   assertion of support for a channel protocol could encourage RBridge
   Channel messages to be sent to an RBridge that does not support the
   channel feature or the particular channel protocol used.  The inner
   frame of such messages could be decapsulated and that inner frame
   could be sent out all ports that are Appointed Forwarders for the
   frame's Inner.VLAN.  However, this is unlikely to cause much harm; in
   particular, there are two possibilities as follows: (a) if end
   stations do not recognize the RBridge-Channel Ethertype of the frame,
   they will drop it, and (b) if end stations do recognize the RBridge-
   Channel Ethertype and the channel protocol indicated in the frame,
   they should refuse to process the frame due to an incorrect value of
   the RBridge Channel Header NA flag.
