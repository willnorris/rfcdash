Abstract

   This document describes the objects necessary to include information
   about IP networks and IP numbers in the X.500 Directory. It extends
   the work "Charting networks in the X.500 Directory" [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Charting Networks in the X.500 Directory"'>1</a>] where a
   general framework is presented for representing networks in the
   Directory by applying it to IP networks.  This application of the
   Directory is intended to support the work of IP network assigning
   authorities, NICs, as well as other applications looking for a
   mapping of IP numbers to data of related networks. Furthermore,
   Autonomous Systems and related routing policy information can be
   represented in the Directory along with their relationship to
   networks and organizations.

   Information related to the Internet Network Infrastructure is created
   and stored by a number of different organizations, such as the
   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), Internet Registry (IR),
   Network Information Centers (NICs), and the NSFNET Network Operations
   Center (NOC).  This information is generally "mastered" (stored and
   maintained) by these organizations on a centralized basis, i.e.,
   there is a single place to look for a definitive list of entries for
   these categories.  This has worked well in the past but given the
   tremendous growth of the Internet and its number of users and
   networks, it is essential that a distributed schema be used.

   The X.500 Directory offers the appropriate technology for
   implementing this distributed method of managing network
   infrastructure information.

   The following goals are addressed in this document:

    o Provision of IP specific images of network elements
    o Mapping from Network Number to network, owner, provider etc.
    o Support of delegation of IP address blocks
    o Storage of high-level routing policies and AS information
    o Support of "classless" network address formats

    o Provision of several organizational images of a network

   It may be noted that the document basically consists of two parts.
   In the first part, an IP specific extension of the general framework
   "Charting networks in the Directory" [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Charting Networks in the X.500 Directory"'>1</a>] is given.  Objects defined
   by the application of this framework are related to IP numbers. An IP
   namespace is defined in the second part of this paper, referring to
   IP network elements defined at the beginning.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20IP%20images%20of%20networks"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. IP images of networks</span>

   As defined in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Charting Networks in the X.500 Directory"'>1</a>], networks are modeled as a set of subnetworks and
   nodes, called network elements in the remainder. To obtain a
   particular view of a network element, images were introduced.  Below,
   images of network elements for an IP specific view are defined.
   Please note that images contain references to underlying physical
   information about elements.

   In the remainder, ipStringSyntax is used as attribute type for all
   attributes that are to hold an IP number. Currently, there are two
   definitions for a syntax like this:

    o IpAddress as of [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based internets"'>5</a>]
    o ip as of [<a href="#ref-6" title='"The COSINE and Internet X.500 Schema"'>6</a>]

   It is suggested to use CaseIgnoreStringSyntax for implementations for
   the time being with the convention to use the ordinary IP syntax.
   Nevertheless, an OID has been reserved for ipStringSyntax (see
   Appendix).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1%20IP%20network%20image"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a> IP network image</span>

   IP network image is one application of network images and therefore
   inherits the networkImageClass. This class is given below for
   reference only, its definition can be found in [<a href="#ref-1" title='"Charting Networks in the X.500 Directory"'>1</a>].

   networkImage OBJECT CLASS
    SUBCLASS of ImageCommunicationObject
    MAY CONTAIN
     externalGateway :: distinguishedNameSyntax,
      /* points to one or more nodes that act
         as gateway for the protocol application
         this image refers to */

   An IP network combines all network elements that have a common IP
   network number.  Presently, IP network numbers fall into one of the
   classes A, B, or C. However, sub- and supernetworking is already done
   broadly, and classless networks numbers are expected to be assigned



<span class="grey">Johannsen, Mansfield, Kosters &amp; Sataluri                        [Page 3]</span></pre>

   soon. [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Guidelines for Management of IP Address Space"'>2</a>] proposes to assign bitwise contiguous blocks of class-C-
   addresses to all networks with more than 255 nodes. The definition of
   IP network, therefore, is always related to common network number and
   network mask.

   IP networks have a very close relationship to the Domain Name System.
   Several attributes are introduced to take care of these relations.
   Though we do not intend to abolish the existing DNS service, the
   schema defined here is able to provide the mapping IP number to
   domain name and vice versa.

   An IP network image object as defined below is intended to provide
   technical and administrative data for one IP network. Attributes hold
   information that a NIC-WHOIS server would reveal for the network, and
   more.

   ipNetworkImage OBJECT CLASS
    SUBCLASS of NetworkImage
    MUST CONTAIN
     ipNetworkImageName :: CaseIgnoreString,
      /* common name */

   The most important IP related information of a node (its IP

   picture is accurate as a node can have several IP addresses, but at
   most one per interface.  Furthermore, it shows clearly the

   The networkInterfaceImageClass is given below for reference only, its

   Autonomous Systems (AS) are defined in asObject which is a subclass of
   imageCommunicationObject.  It provides technical and administrative
   information of an AS. Furthermore, routing policies can be stored with
   the AS object.  The definition of the AS object is aligned with the
   corresponding database object defined in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Representation of IP Routing Policies in the RIPE Database"'>3</a>].

   Note that routing policies for an Autonomous System are represented

   constraints of present X.500 technology, it will probably not be used
   directly by routers for dynamic routing.  However, it certainly can
   be used in network management systems to determine the allowed paths
   [i.e.,  in accordance with published policies] between two networks.
   This will be useful in finding alternate paths, and evaluating the
   connectivity of networks.

   In the following, Directory objects have been defined to represent IP
   and AS (Autonomous System) namespace in the Directory. Their purpose
   is to provide

     o mapping from IP number to IP network element (network or node)
     o mapping from IP number to AS number and vice versa
     o assignment and delegation information

   The need for a global, distributed database supporting the objectives
   arises mainly from distributed IP- and AS-number assignment.

   Describing all IP numbers with one of the new objects delegatedBlock,
   ipGroup and ipReference leads to the desired information. AS number
   information is stored with the objects asBlock and asReference.
   Furthermore, all assigned numbers have some properties in common.
   Therefore, an objectclass assignedNumberClass is introduced. This
   class exports attributes to delegatedBlock, ipGroup, ipReference,
   asBlock, and asReference.

   AssignedNumberClass is defined as follows ("number" always refers to
   IP number of delegatedBlock, network, host, and AS number, resp.):

   assignedNumberClass OBJECT CLASS
    SUBCLASS of  top
    MAY CONTAIN
     assBy :: DistinguishedNameSyntax,

   This object provides information on a block of IP addresses delegated
   to some local-authority or service provider. Only contiguous blocks
   can be represented with the following schema. If an organization
   (say, a NIC) has been assigned several IP network numbers which do
   not form a contiguous block, it might want to use a different form of
   representing that fact (e.g., using imageNetworks).  The
   delegatedBlock object holds lower and upper bounds of the block.

   Note that the above does not make any assumption about the network
   masks being constrained by byte boundaries. We can thus represent
   subnetting within a "network (number)" that often happens within an

   organization in the same framework.

   This schema does lead to some granularity in the otherwise flat IP-
   number space. Further, the granularity is significant as it may be
   used to identify the administrator of the block - a service provider
   or a domain manager.  E.g., it fits well into the schema of
   aggregating networks for routing purposes as has been proposed in
   [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Supernetting: An Address Assignment and Aggregation Strategy"'>4</a>].

   The object delegatedBlock is of the form:

   delegatedBlock OBJECT CLASS
    SUBCLASS of AssignedNumberClass
    MUST CONTAIN
     delegatedBlockName :: caseIgnoreStringSyntax,
     lowerBound :: IPStringSyntax,
      /* smallest IP address belonging to the
         block, e.g. 195.100.0.0 */
     upperBound :: IPStringSyntax
      /* highest  IP address belonging to the
         block, e.g. 195.103.255.255 */

   The attribute relNwElement (inherited from AssignedNumberClass) can
   point to a networkImage covering all networks within the block if
   this makes sense.

   This object provides information for an IP network number.  Its
   purpose is basically only to

      o show that the number has been assigned, and
      o provide a reference to the descriptive ipNetworkObject for
        this network.

   Regardless of the actual value of x, IP group objects may exist for
   IP numbers x.0.0.0, x.y.0.0 and x.y.z.0. This approach includes
   "classical" class-A, -B and -C network addresses as well as any kind
   of super- and subnetworking.

   There is one IP reference object for each IP host address.  The

   An AS reference object is used to show that an Autonomous System
   number has been assigned (and thus can not be given to somebody
   else).  Similar to ipGroup, asReference does not contain technical
   details about an autonomous system itself but rather points (with
   relNwElement) to a descriptive asObject.

   The tree is built under an administrative and an implementational
   view.  Nowadays, network numbers usually are assigned to
   organizations by (national) Network Information Centers (NIC) which
   themselves have got a block of IP network numbers assigned from
   another authority (e.g., IR at top level). This concept of delegated
   blocks falling apart in smaller delegated blocks and IP network
   numbers is used to model the Directory tree. Thus, an ipGroup object
   is always subordinate of a delegated block object (namely the
   delegated block including this IP number). Network numbers that were
   directly assigned by a top-level authority, i.e., have not been
   object of a delegation to a local assigning authority, will all be at
   one level in the Directory.  Already today, however, we find many
   delegations within the traditional class A-, B- and C-addresses.
   Such a delegation is represented by a delegated block object, having
   the assigned IP network numbers as subordinates. Also, part of the
   block can be further delegated to another authority, leading to
   another delegated block object within the parent delegated block's
   tree.  Usually, subordinates of ipGroup objects are ipReferences,
   i.e., single IP addresses as assigned to nodes. To support
   subnetworking, it is also allowed to divide ipGroups into several
   subnetwork ipGroups, each representing an IP subnetwork.  In such
   cases, subnetwork numbers are given as subordinates to the assigned
   IP network number.  Network masks clarify what the subnetwork
   addresses are.

   disadvantages in the look-up procedure. In that case one might think
   of combining both object classes with the aim to provide one object
   describing administrative and technical data for an IP network.

   As Autonomous Systems are an additional namespace to the existing IP
   number space, they should go into a separate subtree. It is suggested
   that this is an organizationalUnit within @o=Internet@ou=Network
   Information.

     objectClass= organizationalUnit
     organizationalUnitName= AS numbers
     description= root of Autonomous System number space

   Similar to blocks of IP network numbers, blocks of AS numbers are
   sometimes delegated to another registry. This is expressed by asBlock
   objects.  These objects come below the root of the AS number space.
   All AS numbers falling into such a block are stored as subordinates
   of the block. An AS block may have smaller AS blocks underneath if
   delegation is extended.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4%20Relationship%20to%20organizational%20entries"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a> Relationship to organizational entries</span>

   Organizational information (i.e., white-pages-like information about
   an organization, its departments and employees) occurs at several
   places in the network DIT - [org of IP-Number, org of AS-Number, org
   of Admin- contact, However, it will be basically mastered
   [administered, maintained] by the organization itself in the
   Directory Management Domain (DMD) over which the organization has the
   authority.  This gives rise to some tricky problems - a typical
   example is that of a NIC which holds the AS, DNS, IP, ...  subtrees
   of the DIT.

   A good strategy would avoid explicit duplication of information.  By
   explicit duplication of information we understand information being
   duplicated outside the directory framework, e.g., by having several
   master entries for one and the same piece of information. The only
   way to avoid duplication would be to have relevant entries point to
   the pertinent organizational entry for organizational information.
   But since

     o most organizations do not, as yet, have an entry in the DIT and
     o the reliability of the access to an organizations DIT when
       stored in a remote DSA cannot be taken for granted,

   the following framework is adopted to accommodate the conflicting
   requirements /conditions.





<span class="grey">Johannsen, Mansfield, Kosters &amp; Sataluri                       [Page 13]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-14" id="page-14" name="page-14"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1608.html">RFC 1608</a>         IP Information in the X.500 Directory        March 1994</span>


     o A copy of all the necessary organization-info is retained
       at the NICs DSA. Since only  the  necessary info will be kept
       the NIC will not be burdened to act as the repository of the
       organizations DIT. These objects may be kept in a separate
       subtree of affiliated-organizations [organizations
       affiliated to the NIC]. Though the affiliated organizations node
       does not really represent a locality, it is suggested to define
       the node as objectClass locality. This does not break the
       Directory schema when entries of organizations shall become
       subordinate to the NICs organization's entry.

     o The problem of information duplication/consistency will arise when
       organizational DITs/DSAs do come into existence. At that stage a
       shadowing mechanism which will attempt to maintain the data
       consistency may be resorted to. The X.500/ISO 9594(1993)
       implementations are expected to provide appropriate shadowing
       mechanisms along X.525.

   It may be noted that what is suggested is not a duplication of an
   entire white-pages-like structure at the NIC.  It suggests an
   "affiliated organizations node". The entries under this node will be
   organization objects with a limited number of attributes, i.e., the
   attributes to hold the organization info necessary for the NIC:
   nothing more, nothing less.  Operationally, and content wise the NIC
   DSA will hold exactly the amount of info that is desired by the NIC.
   When an organization sets up its DSA and when the organization
   informs the NIC about it, the NIC will set up the shadowing
   arrangement to obtain info on changes of interest [and forget about
   it].

   It may be emphasized that the entries under affiliated organizations
   are physical entities [replicated and refined from the Master
   entries, if and when they exist...] rather than alias entries. If a
   NIC dislikes the idea of users poring over the entries in the
   affiliated organizations - appropriate access control can be applied.
   Though duplication is unavoidable, the proposal attempts to make it
   transparent, by delegating the responsibility of maintaining the
   integrity to the Directory.

   This issue is discussed in greater detail in a separate document [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Deployment Strategy for the Directory in the Internet"'>7</a>].
