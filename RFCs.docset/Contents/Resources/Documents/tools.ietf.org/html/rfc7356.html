Abstract

   Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) provides efficient
   and reliable flooding of information to its peers; however, the
   current flooding scopes are limited to either area scope or domain
   scope.  There are existing use cases where support of other flooding
   scopes is desirable.  This document defines new Protocol Data Units
   (PDUs) that provide support for new flooding scopes as well as
   additional space for advertising information targeted for the
   currently supported flooding scopes.  This document also defines
   extended Type-Length-Values (TLVs) and sub-TLVs that are encoded
   using 16-bit fields for Type and Length.

   The protocol extensions defined in this document are not backwards
   compatible with existing implementations and so must be deployed with
   care.

   The Update Process, as defined by [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intradomain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>], provides reliable and
   efficient flooding of information to all routers in a given flooding
   scope.  Currently, the protocol supports two flooding scopes and
   associated PDUs.  Level 1 (L1) Link State PDUs (LSPs) are flooded to
   all routers in an area.  Level 2 (L2) LSPs are flooded to all routers
   in the Level 2 subdomain.  The basic operation of the Update Process
   can be applied to any subset of the routers in a given topology so
   long as that topology is not partitioned.  It is, therefore, possible
   to introduce new PDUs in support of other flooding scopes and utilize
   the same Update Process machinery to provide the same reliability and
   efficiency that the Update Process currently provides for L1 and L2
   scopes.  This document defines these new PDUs and the modified Update
   Process rules that are to be used in supporting new flooding scopes.

   New deployment cases have introduced the need for reliable and
   efficient circuit scope flooding.  For example, Appointed Forwarder
   information, as defined in [<a href="rfc7176.html" title='"Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) Use of IS-IS"'>RFC7176</a>], needs to be flooded reliably
   and efficiently to all Routing Bridges (RBridges) on a broadcast
   circuit.  Currently, only IS-IS Hellos (IIHs) have the matching scope
   -- but IIHs are unreliable, i.e., individual IIHs may be lost without
   affecting correct operation of the protocol.  To provide reliability
   in cases where the set of information to be flooded exceeds the
   carrying capacity of a single PDU requires sending the information
   periodically even when no changes in the content have occurred.  When
   the information content is large, this is inefficient and still does
   not provide a guarantee of reliability.  This document defines
   circuit scope flooding in order to provide a solution for such cases.

   Another existing limitation of [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intradomain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>] is the carrying capacity of an
   LSP set.  It has been noted in [<a href="rfc5311.html" title='"Simplified Extension of Link State PDU (LSP) Space for IS-IS"'>RFC5311</a>] that the set of LSPs that
   may be originated by a system at each level is limited to 256 LSPs,
   and the maximum size of each LSP is limited by the minimum Maximum
   Transmission Unit (MTU) of any link used to flood LSPs.  [<a href="rfc5311.html" title='"Simplified Extension of Link State PDU (LSP) Space for IS-IS"'>RFC5311</a>]
   has defined a backwards-compatible protocol extension that can be
   used to overcome this limitation if needed.  While the [<a href="rfc5311.html" title='"Simplified Extension of Link State PDU (LSP) Space for IS-IS"'>RFC5311</a>]
   solution is viable, in order to be interoperable with routers that do
   not support the extension, it imposes some restrictions on what can/
   cannot be advertised in the Extended LSPs and requires allocation of
   multiple unique system IDs to a given router.  A more flexible and
   less constraining solution is possible if interoperability with
   legacy routers is not a requirement.  By definition, the introduction
   of new PDUs required to support new flooding scopes is not
   interoperable with legacy routers.  It is, therefore, possible to
   simultaneously introduce an alternative solution to the limited LSP
   set carrying capacity of Level 1 and Level 2 LSPs as part of the
   extensions defined in this document.  This capability is also defined
   in this document.

   Standard IS-IS TLVs are encoded using an 8-bit type and an 8-bit
   length.  In cases where the set of information about a single object
   exceeds 255 octets, multiple TLVs are required to encode all of the
   relevant information.  This document introduces extended TLVs and
   extended sub-TLVs that use a 16-bit Type field and a 16-bit Length
   field.

   The PDU Type field in the common header for all IS-IS PDUs is a 5-bit
   field.  Therefore, possible PDU types supported by the protocol are
   limited to a maximum of 32.  In order to minimize the need to
   introduce additional PDU types in the future, the new PDUs introduced
   in this document are defined so as to allow multiple flooding scopes
   to be associated with the same PDU type.  This means if new flooding
   scopes are required in the future, the same PDU type can be used.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Extended%20TLVs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Extended TLVs</span>

   Standard TLVs as defined in [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intradomain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>] as well as standard sub-TLVs
   (first introduced in [<a href="rfc5305.html" title='"IS-IS Extensions for Traffic Engineering"'>RFC5305</a>]) have an 8-bit Type field and an
   eight-bit Length field.  This constrains the information included in
   a single TLV or sub-TLV to 255 octets.  With the increasing use of
   sub-TLVs, it becomes more likely that the amount of information about
   a single object that needs to be advertised may exceed 255 octets.
   In such cases, the information is encoded in multiple TLVs.  This
   leads to less efficient encoding since the information that uniquely
   identifies the object must be repeated in each TLV and requires
   additional implementation complexity when receiving the information
   to ensure that all information about the object is correctly
   collected from the multiple TLVs.

   This document introduces extended TLVs and extended sub-TLVs.  These
   are encoded using a 16-bit Type field and a 16-bit Length field.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Use%20of%20Extended%20TLVs%20and%20Extended%20Sub-TLVs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Use of Extended TLVs and Extended Sub-TLVs</span>

   The following restrictions apply to the use of extended TLVs and
   extended sub-TLVs:

   o  Extended TLVs and extended sub-TLVs are permitted only in Flooding
      Scope PDUs that have a flooding scope designated for their use
      (defined later in this document)

   o  A given flooding scope supports either the use of standard TLVs
      and standard sub-TLVs or the use of extended TLVs and extended
      sub-TLVs, but not both

   o  Extended TLVs and extended sub-TLVs MUST be used together, i.e.,
      using Standard sub-TLVs within an Extended TLV or using Extended
      sub-TLVs within a Standard TLV is invalid

   o  If additional levels of TLVs (e.g., sub-sub-TLVs) are introduced
      in the future, then the size of the Type and Length fields in
      these new sub-types MUST match the size used in the parent

   o  The 16-bit Type and Length fields are encoded in network byte
      order

   o  Use of extended TLVs and extended sub-TLVs does not alter in any
      way the maximum size of PDUs that may sent or received

Use of Standard Code Points in Extended TLVs and Extended Sub-TLVs</span>

   Standard TLV and standard sub-TLV code points as defined in the IANA
   "IS-IS TLV Codepoints" registry MAY be used in extended TLVs and
   extended sub-TLVs.  Encoding is as specified for each of the standard
   TLVs and standard sub-TLVs with the following differences:

   o  The 8-bit Type field is encoded as an unsigned 16-bit integer
      where the 8 most significant bits (MSBs) are all 0

   o  The 8-bit Length field is replaced by the 16-bit Length field

   o  The length MAY take on values greater than 255

   In support of new flooding scopes, the following new PDUs are
   required:

   o  Flooding Scope LSPs (FS-LSPs)

   o  Flooding Scope Complete Sequence Number PDUs (FS-CSNPs)

   o  Flooding Scope Partial Sequence Number PDUs (FS-PSNPs)

   Each of these PDUs is intentionally defined with a header as similar
   in format as possible to the corresponding PDU types currently
   defined in [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intradomain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>].  Although it might have been possible to
   eliminate or redefine PDU header fields in a new way, the existing
   formats are retained in order to allow maximum reuse of existing PDU
   processing logic in an implementation.

   Note that in the case of all FS PDUs, the Maximum Area Addresses
   field in the header of the corresponding standard PDU has been
   replaced with a Scope field.  Therefore, maximum area addresses
   checks specified in [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intradomain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>] are not performed on FS PDUs.

   The Update Process, as defined in [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intradomain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>], maintains a Link State
   Database (LSDB) for each level supported.  Each level-specific LSDB
   contains the full set of LSPs generated by all routers operating in
   that level-specific scope.  The introduction of FS-LSPs creates
   additional LSDBs (FS-LSDBs) for each additional scope supported.  The
   set of FS-LSPs in each FS-LSDB consists of all FS-LSPs generated by
   all routers operating in that scope.  Therefore, there is an
   additional instance of the Update Process for each supported flooding
   scope.

   Operation of the scope-specific Update Process follows the Update
   Process specification in [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intradomain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>].  The circuit(s) on which FS-LSPs
   are flooded is limited to those circuits that are participating in
   the given scope.  Similarly, the sending/receiving of FS-CSNPs and
   FS-PSNPs is limited to the circuits participating in the given scope.

   Consistent support of a given flooding scope on a circuit by all
   routers operating on that circuit is required.

   A flooding scope may be limited to a single circuit (circuit scope).
   Circuit scopes may be further limited by level (L1 Circuit Scope / L2
   Circuit Scope).

   A flooding scope may be limited to all circuits enabled for L1
   routing (area scope).

   A flooding scope may be limited to all circuits enabled for L2
   routing (L2 subdomain scope).

   Additional scopes may be defined that include all circuits enabled
   for either L1 or L2 routing (domain scope).

   When a new adjacency is formed, synchronization of all FS-LSDBs
   supported on that circuit is required; therefore, FS-CSNPs for all
   supported scopes MUST be sent when a new adjacency reaches the UP
   state.  The Send Receive Message (SRM) bit MUST be set for all
   FS-LSPs associated with the scopes supported on that circuit.
   Receipt of an FS-PSNP with the U bit equal to 1 indicates that the
   neighbor does not support that scope (although it does support FS
   PDUs).  This MUST cause the SRM bit to be cleared for all FS-LSPs
   with the matching scope, which are currently marked for flooding on
   that circuit.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20Operation%20on%20Broadcast%20Circuits"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Operation on Broadcast Circuits</span>

   FS PDUs are sent to the same destination address(es) as standard PDUs
   for the given protocol instance.  For specification of the defined
   destination addresses, consult [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intradomain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>], [<a href="#ref-IEEEaq" title='"Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks -- Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges and Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks -- Amendment 20: Shortest Path Bridging"'>IEEEaq</a>], [<a href="rfc6822.html" title='"IS-IS Multi-Instance"'>RFC6822</a>], and
   [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>].

   The Designated Intermediate System (DIS) for a broadcast circuit has
   the responsibility to generate periodic scope-specific FS-CSNPs for
   all supported scopes.  A scope-specific DIS is NOT elected as all
   routers on a circuit MUST support a consistent set of flooding
   scopes.

   It is possible that a scope may be defined that is not level
   specific.  In such a case, the DIS for each level enabled on a
   broadcast circuit MUST independently send FS PDUs for that scope to
   the appropriate level-specific destination address.  This may result
   in redundant flooding of FS-LSPs for that scope.

   Authentication TLVs MAY be included in FS PDUs.  When authentication
   is in use, the scope is first used to select the authentication
   configuration that is applicable.  The authentication check is then
   performed as normal.  Although scope-specific authentication MAY be
   used, sharing of authentication among multiple scopes and/or with the
   standard LSPs/CSNPs/PSNPs is considered sufficient.

   When the FS LSP ID Extended format is used, the set of LSPs generated
   by an IS may be quite large.  It may be useful to identify those LSPs
   in the set that contain information of higher priority.  Such LSPs
   will have the P bit set to 1 in the Scope field in the LSP header.
   Such LSPs SHOULD be flooded at a higher priority than LSPs with the P
   bit set to 0.  This is a suggested behavior on the part of the
   originator of the LSP.  When an LSP is purged, the original state of
   the P bit MUST be preserved.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Deployment%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Deployment Considerations</span>

   Introduction of new PDU types is incompatible with legacy
   implementations.  Legacy implementations do not support the
   FS-specific Update process(es) and, therefore, flooding of the
   FS-LSPs throughout the defined scope is unreliable when not all
   routers in the defined scope support FS PDUs.  Further, legacy
   implementations will likely treat the reception of an FS PDU as an
   error.  Even when all routers in a given scope support FS PDUs, if
   not all routers in the flooding domain for a given scope support that
   scope, then flooding of the FS-LSPs may be compromised.  When
   deploying a new flooding scope, correct operation therefore requires
   that both FS PDUs and the new scope be supported by all routers in
   the flooding domain of the new scope.

   The U bit in FS-PSNPs provides a means to suppress retransmissions of
   unsupported scopes.  Routers that support FS PDUs SHOULD support the
   sending of PSNPs with the U bit equal to 1 when an FS-LSP is received
   with a scope that is unsupported.  Routers that support FS PDUs
   SHOULD trigger management notifications when FS PDUs are received for
   unsupported scopes and when PSNPs with the U bit equal to 1 are
   received.

   [<a id="ref-RFC5306" name="ref-RFC5306">RFC5306</a>] defines protocol extensions in support of graceful restart
   of a routing instance.  Synchronization of all supported FS-LSDBs is
   required in order for database synchronization to be complete.  This
   involves the use of additional T2 timers.  Receipt of a PSNP with the
   U bit equal to 1 will cause FS-LSDB synchronization with that
   neighbor to be considered complete for that scope.  See [<a href="rfc5306.html" title='"Restart Signaling for IS-IS"'>RFC5306</a>] for

   In cases where FS-PDUs are associated with a non-zero instance, the
   use of Instance Identifier TLVs (IID-TLVs) in FS-PDUs follows the

   This document defines four circuit scope flooding identifiers:

   o  Level 1 Circuit Scope (L1CS) -- this uses standard TLVs and
      standard sub-TLVs

   o  Level 2 Circuit Scope (L2CS) -- this uses standard TLVs and
      standard sub-TLVs

   o  Extended Level 1 Circuit Scope (E-L1CS) -- this uses extended TLVs
      and extended sub-TLVs

   o  Extended Level 2 Circuit Scope (E-L2CS) -- this uses extended TLVs
      and extended sub-TLVs

   FS-LSPs with the Scope field set to one of these values contain
   information specific to the circuit on which they are flooded.  When
   received, such FS-LSPs MUST NOT be flooded on any other circuit.  The
   FS LSP ID Extended format is used in these PDUs.  The FS-LSDB
   associated with circuit scope FS-LSPs consists of the set of FS-LSPs
   that both have matching circuit scopes and are transmitted (locally
   generated) or received on a specific circuit.

   The set of TLVs that may be included in such FS-LSPs is specific to
   the given use case and is outside the scope of this document.

   The need for additional space in the set of LSPs generated by a
   single IS has been articulated in [<a href="rfc5311.html" title='"Simplified Extension of Link State PDU (LSP) Space for IS-IS"'>RFC5311</a>].  When legacy
   interoperability is not a requirement, the use of FS-LSPs meets that
   need without requiring the assignment of alias system-ids to a single
   IS.  Four flooding scopes are defined for this purpose:

   o  Level 1 Flooding Scope (L1FS) -- this uses standard TLVs and
      standard sub-TLVs

   o  Level 2 Flooding Scope (L2FS) -- this uses standard TLVs and
      standard sub-TLVs

   o  Extended Level 1 Flooding Scope (E-L1FS) -- this uses extended
      TLVs and extended sub-TLVs

   o  Extended Level 2 Flooding Scope (E-L2FS) -- this uses extended
      TLVs and extended sub-TLVs

   L1FS and E-L1FS LSPs are flooded on all L1 circuits.  L2FS and E-L2FS
   LSPs are flooded on all L2 circuits.

   The FS LSP ID Extended format is used in these PDUs.  This provides
   64 K of additional LSPs that may be generated by a single system at
   each level.

   LxFS and E-LxFS LSPs are used by the level-specific Decision Process
   (defined in [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intradomain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>]) in the same manner as standard LSPs (i.e., as
   additional information sourced by the same IS) subject to the
   following restrictions:

   o  A valid version of standard LSP #0 from the same IS at the
      corresponding level MUST be present in the LSDB in order for the
      LxFS/E-LxFS set to be usable.

   o  Information in an LxFS of E-LxFS LSP (e.g., IS-Neighbor
      information) that supports using the originating IS as a transit
      node MUST NOT be used when the Overload bit is set in the
      corresponding standard LSP #0.

   o  TLVs that are restricted to standard LSP #0 MUST NOT appear in
      LxFS LSPs.

   There are no further restrictions as to what TLVs may be advertised
   in FS-LSPs.

   Existing support for flooding information throughout a domain (i.e.,
   to L1 routers in all areas as well as to routers in the Level 2
   subdomain) requires the use of leaking procedures between levels.
   For further details, see [<a href="rfc4971.html" title='"Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Extensions for Advertising Router Information"'>RFC4971</a>].  This is sufficient when the data
   being flooded throughout the domain consists of individual TLVs.  If
   it is desired to retain the identity of the originating IS for the
   complete contents of a PDU, then support for flooding the unchanged
   PDU is desirable.  This document, therefore, defines two flooding
   scopes in support of domain flooding.  FS-LSPs with this scope MUST
   be flooded on all circuits regardless of what level(s) is supported
   on that circuit.

   o  Domain Flooding Scope (DFS) -- this uses standard TLVs and
      standard sub-TLVs

   o  Extended Domain Flooding Scope (E-DFS) -- this uses extended TLVs
      and extended sub-TLVs

   The FS LSP ID Extended format is used in these PDUs.

   Use of information in FS-LSPs for a given scope depends on
   determining the reachability to the IS originating the FS-LSP.  This
   presents challenges for FS-LSPs with domain scopes because no single
   IS has the full view of the topology across all areas.  It is,
   therefore, necessary for the originator of domain scope DSFS and
   E-DSFS LSPs to advertise an identifier that will allow an IS who
   receives such an FS-LSP to determine whether the source of the FS-LSP
   is currently reachable.  The identifier required depends on what
   "address-families" are being advertised.

   When IS-IS is deployed in support of Layer 3 routing for IPv4 and/or
   IPv6, then FS-LSP #0 with domain scope MUST include at least one of
   the following TLVs:

   o  IPv4 Traffic Engineering Router ID (TLV 134)

   o  IPv6 Traffic Engineering Router ID (TLV 140)

   When IS-IS is deployed in support of Layer 2 routing, current
   standards (e.g., [<a href="rfc6325.html" title='"Routing Bridges (RBridges): Base Protocol Specification"'>RFC6325</a>]) only support a single area.  Therefore,
   domain scope is not yet applicable.  When the Layer 2 standards are
   updated to include multi-area support, the identifiers that can be
   used to support inter-area reachability will be defined -- at which
   point the use of domain scope for Layer 2 can be fully defined.

   Announcements of support for flooding scope may be useful in
   validating that full support has been deployed and/or in isolating
   the reasons for incomplete flooding of FS-LSPs for a given scope.

   ISs supporting FS-PDUs MAY announce supported scopes in IIH PDUs.  To
   do so, a new TLV is defined.

   Scope Flooding Support
   Type:   243
   Length: 1 - 127
   Value
                                    No. of octets

          +----------------------+

       A list of the circuit scopes supported on this circuit and other
       non-circuit-flooding scopes supported.

       R bit MUST be 0 and is ignored on receipt.

       In a Point-to-Point IIH, L1, L2, domain, and all circuit scopes
       MAY be advertised.

       In Level 1 LAN IIHs, L1, domain, and L1 Circuit Scopes MAY be
       advertised.  L2 Scopes and L2 Circuit Scopes MUST NOT be
       advertised.

       In Level 2 LAN IIHs, L2, domain, and L2 Circuit Scopes MAY be
       advertised.  L1 Scopes and L1 Circuit Scopes MUST NOT be
       advertised.

   Information in this TLV MUST NOT be considered in adjacency
   formation.

   Whether information in this TLV is used to determine when FS-LSPs
   associated with a locally supported scope are flooded is an
   implementation choice.

   A new IANA registry has been created to control the assignment of
   scope identifiers in FS-PDUs.  The registration procedure is "Expert
   Review" as defined in [<a href="rfc5226.html" title='"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"'>RFC5226</a>].  The registry name is "LSP Flooding
   Scope Identifier Registry".  A scope identifier is a number from
   1-127, inclusive.  Values 1 - 63 are reserved for PDUs that use
   standard TLVs and standard sub-TLVs.  Values 64 - 127 are reserved
   for PDUs that use extended TLVs and extended sub-TLVs.  The list of
   Hello PDUs in which support for a given scope MAY be announced (using
   Scope Flooding Support TLV) is specified for each defined scope.

   The following scope identifiers are defined by this document.

   The IANA "IS-IS TLV Codepoints" registry has been extended to allow
   definition of codepoints less than or equal to 65535.  Codepoints
   greater than 255 can only be used in PDUs designated to support
   extended TLVs.  This registry has also been updated to point to this
   document as a reference (in addition to [<a href="rfc3563.html" title='"Cooperative Agreement Between the ISOC/IETF and ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1/Sub Committee 6 (JTC1/SC6) on IS-IS Routing Protocol Development"'>RFC3563</a>] and [<a href="rfc6233.html" title='"IS-IS Registry Extension for Purges"'>RFC6233</a>]).

   Security concerns for IS-IS are addressed in [<a href="#ref-IS-IS" title='"Information technology -- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems -- Intermediate System to Intermediate System intradomain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode network service (ISO 8473)"'>IS-IS</a>], [<a href="rfc5304.html" title='"IS-IS Cryptographic Authentication"'>RFC5304</a>], and
   [<a href="rfc5310.html" title='"IS-IS Generic Cryptographic Authentication"'>RFC5310</a>].

   The new PDUs introduced are subject to the same security issues
   associated with their standard LSP/CSNP/PSNP counterparts.  To the
   extent that additional PDUs represent additional load for routers in
   the network, this increases the opportunity for denial-of-service
   attacks.
