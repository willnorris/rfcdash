Abstract

   It has become a common practice to use symbolic names (usually
   CNAMEs) in the Domain Name Service (DNS - [RFC-1034, <a href="rfc1035.html">RFC-1035</a>]) to
   refer to network services such as anonymous FTP [<a href="rfc959.html" title='"File Transfer Protocol"'>RFC-959</a>] servers,
   Gopher [<a href="rfc1436.html" title='"The Internet Gopher Protocol (a distributed document search and retrieval protocol)"'>RFC-1436</a>] servers, and most notably World-Wide Web HTTP
   [<a href="rfc1945.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0"'>RFC-1945</a>] servers.  This is desirable for a number of reasons.  It
   provides a way of moving services from one machine to another
   transparently, and a mechanism by which people or agents may
   programmatically discover that an organization runs, say, a World-
   Wide Web server.

   Although this approach has been almost universally adopted, there is
   no standards document or similar specification for these commonly
   used names.  This document seeks to rectify this situation by
   gathering together the extant 'folklore' on naming conventions, and
   proposes a mechanism for accommodating new protocols.

   It is important to note that these naming conventions do not provide
   a complete long term solution to the problem of finding a particular
   network service for a site.  There are efforts in other IETF working
   groups to address the long term solution to this problem, such as the
   Server Location Resource Records (DNS SRV) [<a href="rfc2052.html" title='"A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)"'>RFC-2052</a>] work.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20Rationale"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>. Rationale</span>

   In order to locate the network services offered at a particular
   Internet domain one is faced with the choice of selecting from a
   growing number of centralized databases - typically Web or Usenet
   News "wanderers", or attempting to infer the existence of network
   services from whatever DNS information may be available.  The former
   approach is not practical in some cases, notably when the entity
   seeking service information is a program.



<span class="grey">Hamilton &amp; Wright        Best Current Practice                  [Page 1]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2219.html">RFC 2219</a>                      DNS Aliases                   October 1997</span>


   Perhaps the most visible example of the latter approach at work is in
   the case of World-Wide Web HTTP servers.  It is common practice to
   try prefixing the domain name of an organization with "<a href="http://www/">http://www</a>."
   in order to reach its World-Wide Web site, e.g. taking "hivnet.fr"
   and arriving at "<a href="http://www.hivnet.fr/">http://www.hivnet.fr</a>."  Some popular World-Wide Web
   browsers have gone so far as to provide automatic support for this
   domain name expansion.

   Ideally, the DNS or some complementary directory service would
   provide a means for programs to determine automatically the network
   services which are offered at a particular Internet domain, the
   protocols which are used to deliver them, and other technical
   information.  Unfortunately, although much work has been done to
   develop said directory service technologies and to define new types
   of DNS resource record to provide this type of information, there is
   no widely agreed upon or widely deployed solution to the problem -
   except in a small number of cases.

   The first case is where the DNS already provides a lookup capability
   for the type of information being sought after.  For example: Mail
   Exchanger (MX) records specify how mail to a particular domain should
   be routed [<a href="rfc974.html" title='"Mail routing and the domain System"'>RFC-974</a>], the Start of Authority (SOA) records make it
   possible to determine who is responsible for a given domain, and Name
   Server (NS) records indicate which hosts provide DNS name service for
   a given domain.

   The second case is where the DNS does not provide an appropriate
   lookup capability, but there is some widely accepted convention for
   finding this information.  Some use has been made of Text (TXT)
   [<a href="rfc1035.html" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC-1035</a>] records in this scenario, but in the vast majority of
   cases a Canonical Name (CNAME) or Address (A) record pointer is used
   to indicate the host or hosts which provide the service.  This
   document proposes a slight formalization of this well-known alias
   approach.

   It should be noted that the DNS provides a Well Known Services (WKS)
   [<a href="rfc1035.html" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC-1035</a>] lookup capability, which makes it possible to determine
   the network services offered at a given domain name.  In practice
   this is not widely used, perhaps because of the absence of a suitable
   programming interface.  Use of WKS for mail routing was deprecated in
   the Host Requirements specification [<a href="rfc1123.html" title='"Requirements for Internet hosts - application and support"'>RFC-1123</a>] in favour of the MX
   record, and in the long term it is conceivable that SRV records will
   supersede both WKS and MX.

   Our approach to dealing with aliases for protocols is
   straightforward. We define a standard set of DNS aliases for the most
   popular network services that currently exist (see the "Special
   Cases" section below). For protocols that are not explicitly listed
   in this document, the protocol specification must propose a name.

   The widespread use of these common aliases effectively means that it
   is sometimes possible to "guess" the domain names associated with an
   organization's network services, though this is becoming more
   difficult as the number of organizations registered in the DNS
   increases.

   It should be understood by implementors that the existence of a DNS
   entry such as

        www.hivnet.fr

   does not constitute a registration of a World-Wide Web service.
   There is no requirement that the domain name resolve to an IP address
   or addresses.  There is no requirement that a host be listening for

   HTTP connections, or if it is, that the HTTP server be running on
   port 80.  Finally, even if all of these things are true, there can be
   no guarantee that the World-Wide Web server will be prepared to honor
   requests from arbitrary clients.

   Having said this, the aliases do provide useful "hints" about the
   services offered.  We propose that they be taken in this spirit.

   The conventions described in this document are, essentially, only
   useful when the organization's domain name can be determined - e.g.
   from some external database.  A number of groups, including the IETF,
   have been working on ways of finding domain names given a set of
   information such as organization name, location, and business type.
   It is hoped that one or more of these will eventually make it
   possible to augment the basic lookup service which the DNS provides
   with a more generalized search and retrieval capability.

   In the short term, whilst directory service technology and further
   types of DNS resource record are being developed, domain name
   administrators are encouraged to use these common names for the
   network services they run.  They will make it easier for outsiders to
   find information about your organization, and also make it easier for
   you to move services from one machine to another.

   There are two conventional approaches to creating these DNS entries.
   One is to add a single CNAME record to your DNS server's
   configuration, e.g.

        ph.hivnet.fr. IN CNAME baby.hivnet.fr.

   Note that in this scenario no information about ph.hivnet.fr should
   exist in the DNS other than the CNAME record. For example,
   ph.hivnet.fr could not contain a MX record.

   An alternative approach would be to create an A record for each of
   the IP addresses associated with ph.hivnet.fr, e.g.

        ph.hivnet.fr. IN A 194.167.157.2

   It isn't a simple matter of recommending CNAMEs over A records. Each
   site has it's own set of requirements that may make one approach
   better than the other. <a href="rfc1912.html">RFC 1912</a> [<a href="rfc1912.html" title='"Common DNS Operational and Configuration Errors"'>RFC-1912</a>]  discusses some of the
   configuration issues involved in using CNAMEs.

   Recent DNS server implementations provide a "round-robin" feature
   which causes the host's IP addresses to be returned in a different
   order each time the address is looked up.

   Network clients are starting to appear which, when they encounter a
   host with multiple addresses, use heuristics to determine the address
   to contact - e.g. picking the one which has the shortest round-trip-
   time.  Thus, if a server is mirrored (replicated) at a number of
   locations, it may be desirable to list the IP addresses of the mirror
   servers as A records of the primary server.  This is only likely to
   be appropriate if the mirror servers are exact copies of the original
   server.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20Limitations%20of%20this%20approach"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>. Limitations of this approach</span>

   Some services require that a client have more information than the
   server's domain name.  For example, an LDAP client needs to know a
   starting search base within the Directory Information Tree in order
   to have a meaningful dialogue with the server.  This document does
   not attempt to address this problem.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20CCSO%20service%20name"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>. CCSO service name</span>

   There are currently at least three different aliases in common use
   for the CCSO nameserver - e.g. "ph", "cso" and "ns".  It would appear
   to be in everyone's interest to narrow the choice of alias down to a
   single name.  "ns" would seem to be the best choice since it is the
   most commonly used name.  However, "ns" is also being used by DNS to
   point to the DNS server.  In fact, the most prevalent use of "ns" is
   to name DNS servers.  For this reason, we suggest the use of "ph" as
   the best name to use for CCSO nameservers.

   Sites with existing CCSO servers using some of these aliases may find
   it desirable to use all three.  This increases the likelihood of the
   service being found.

   As noted earlier, implementations should be resilient in the event
   that the name does not point to the expected service.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" name="section-8">8</a>. Security Considerations</span>

   The DNS is open to many kinds of "spoofing" attacks, and it cannot be
   guaranteed that the result returned by a DNS lookup is indeed the
   genuine information.  Spoofing may take the form of denial of
   service, such as directing of the client to a non-existent address,
   or a passive attack such as an intruder's server which masquerades as
   the legitimate one.

   Work is ongoing to remedy this situation insofar as the DNS is
   concerned [<a href="rfc2065.html" title='"Domain Name System Security Extensions"'>RFC-2065</a>].  In the meantime it should be noted that
   stronger authentication mechanisms such as public key cryptography
   with large key sizes are a pre-requisite if the DNS is being used in
   any sensitive situations.  Examples of these would be on-line
   financial transactions, and any situation where privacy is a concern
   - such as the querying of medical records over the network.  Strong
   encryption of the network traffic may also be advisable, to protect
   against TCP connection "hijacking" and packet sniffing.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20Conclusions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>. Conclusions</span>

   The service names listed in this document provide a sensible set of
   defaults which may be used as an aid in determining the hosts which
   offer particular services for a given domain name.

   This document has noted some exceptions which are either inherently
   unsuitable for this treatment, or already have a substantial
   installed base using alternative aliases.
