was reached. In particular, there are several protocols, which have 32

January 1, 1970 which will turn negative at Tue Jan 19 03:14:07 GMT

Abstract

   The Year 2000 Working Group (WG) has conducted an investigation into
   the millennium problem as it regards Internet related protocols.
   This investigation only targeted the protocols as documented in the
   Request For Comments Series (RFCs).  This investigation discovered
   little reason for concern with regards to the functionality of the
   protocols.  A few minor cases of older implementations still using
   two digit years (ala <a href="rfc850.html">RFC 850</a>) were discovered, but almost all
   Internet protocols were given a clean bill of health.  Several cases
   of "period" problems were discovered, where a time field would "roll
   over" as the size of field was reached.  In particular, there are
   several protocols, which have 32 bit, signed integer representations
   of the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 which will turn
   negative at Tue Jan 19 03:14:07 GMT 2038.  Areas whose protocols will
   be effected by such problems have been notified so that new revisions
   will remove this limitation.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>. Introduction</span>

   According to the trade press billions of dollars will be spend the
   upcoming years on the year 2000 problem, also called the millennium
   problem (though the third millennium will really start in 2001). This
   problem consists of the fact that many software packages and some
   protocols use a two-digit field for the year in a date field. Most of
   the problems seem to be in administrative and financial programs, or
   in the hardcoded microcomputers found in electronic equipment.  A lot
   of organizations are now starting to make an inventory of which
   software and tools they use will suffer from the millennium problem.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2626.html">RFC 2626</a>  The Internet and the Millennium Problem (Year 2000)  June 1999</span>


   With the increasing popularity of the Internet, more and more
   organizations use the Internet as a serious business tool.  This
   means that most organizations will want to analyze the millennium
   problems due to the use of Internet protocols and popular Internet
   software. In the trade press the first articles suggest that the
   Internet will collapse at midnight the 31st of December 1999.

   To counter these suggestions, and to avoid having countless companies
   redo the same investigation, this effort was undertaken by the IETF.
   The Year 2000 WG has made an inventory of all-important Internet
   protocols that have been documented in the Request for Comments (RFC)
   series.  Only protocols directly related to the Internet will be
   considered.

   This document is divided into a number of sections.  <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> is the
   Introduction which you are now reading.  <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> is a disclaimer
   about the completeness of this effort.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> describes areas in
   which millenium problems have been found, while <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> describes a
   few other "period" problems.  <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> describes potential fixes to
   problems that have been identified. <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> describes the
   methodology used in the investigation. Sections <a href="#section-7">7</a> through <a href="#section-22">22</a> are
   devoted to the 15 different groupings of protocols and RFCs.  <a href="#section-23">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-23">23</a> discusses security considerations, <a href="#section-24">Section 24</a> is devoted to
   references, and <a href="#section-25">Section 25</a> is the author contact information.
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> is the list of RFCs examined broken down by category.
   <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a> is a PERL program used to make a first cut identification
   of problems, and <a href="#appendix-C">Appendix C</a> is the output of that PERL program.

   The editor of this document would like to acknowledge the critical
   contributions of the follow for direct performance of research and
   the provision of text: Alex Latzko, Robert Elz, Erik Huizer, Gillian
   Greenwood, Barbara Jennings, R.E. (Robert) Moore, David Mills, Lynn
   Kubinec, Michael Patton, Chris Newman, Erik-Jan Bos, Paul Hoffman,
   and Rick H. Wesson.  The pace with which this group has operated has
   only been achievable by the intimate familiarity of the contributors
   with the protocols and ready access to the collective knowledge of
   the IETF.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>. Disclaimer</span>

   This RFC is not complete.  It is an effort to analyze the Y2K impact
   on hundreds of protocols but is likely to have missed some protocols
   and misunderstood others.  Organizations should not attempt to claim
   any legitimacy or approval for any particular protocol based on this
   document.  The efforts have concentrated on the identification of
   potential problems, rather than solutions to any of the problems that
   have been identified. Any proposed solutions are only that: proposed.
   A formal engineering review should take place before any solution is

   adopted.

   It should also be noted that the research was performd on RFCs 1
   through 2128.  At that time the IESG was charted with not allowing
   any new RFCs to be published that had any Year 2000 issues.   Since
   that cutoff time there has been work to correct issues discovered by
   this Working Group.  In particular, RWhois as documented by <a href="rfc1714.html">RFC 1714</a>
   has been updated to fix the problems found.  <a href="rfc2167.html">RFC 2167</a> now documents a
   fixed version of the RWhois protocol.  The work of this group was to
   look backwards, and hence new RFC's which supplant the old are
   expected to make the information in this RFC obsolete.  The work of
   this group will truly be complete when this document is completely
   obsolete.

   A number of people have suggested looking into other "special" dates.
   For example, the first leap year, the first "double digit" day
   (January 10, 2000), January 1, 2001, etc.  There is not one place
   where days have been used in the protocols defined by the RFC series
   so there is little reason to believe that any of these special dates
   will have any impact.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>. Summary of Year 2000 Problems</span>

   Here is a brief description of all the Millennium issues discovered
   in the course of this research.  Note that many of the RFCs are
   unclear on the issue.  They mandate the use of UTCTime but do not
   specify whether the two-digit or four-digit year representation
   should be used.

   <a href="rfc850.html">RFC850</a> formats.  Some specific recommendations have been passed to
   the HTTP WG.

   After reviewing all mail-related RFCs, it was discovered that while
   some obsolete standards required two-digit years, all currently used
   standards require four-digit years and are thus not prone to typical
   Year 2000 problems.

   RFCs 821 and 822, the main basis for SMTP mail exchange and message
   format, originally required two-digit years. However, both of these
   RFCs were later modified by <a href="rfc1123.html">RFC 1123</a> in 1989, which strongly
   recommended 4-digit years.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a> "Name Serving"</span>

   While not a protocol issue, there is a common habit of writing serial
   numbers for DNS zone files in the form YYXXXXXX.  The only real
   requirement on the serial numbers is that they be increasing (see <a href="rfc1982.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc1982.html">1982</a> for a complete description) and a change from 99XXXXXX to
   00XXXXXX cause a failure.  See the section on "Name Serving" for a
   complete description of the issues.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.5" href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>  "Network Management"</span>

   Version 2 of SNMP's MIB definition language (SMIv2) specifies the use
   of UCTTimes for time stamping MIB modules.  Even though these time
   stamps do not flow in any network protocols, there could be as issue
   with management applications, depending on implementations.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.6" href="#section-3.6">3.6</a>  "Network News"</span>

   There does exist a problem in both NNTP, <a href="rfc977.html">RFC 977</a>, and the Usenet News
   Message Format, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc10336">RFC 10336</a>.  They both specify two-digit year format.
   A working group has been formed to update the network news protocols
   in general, and addressing this problem is on their list of work
   items.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.7" href="#section-3.7">3.7</a>  "Real-Time Services"</span>

   A Year 2000 problem does occur in the Simple Network Paging Protocol,
   versions 2 &amp; 3. Both define a HOLDuntil option which uses a
   YYMMDDHHMMSS+/-GMT field. Version 3 also defines a MSTAtus command,
   which is required to store,dates and times as YYMMDDHHMMSS+/-GMT.

   There is a small Year 2000 issue in <a href="rfc1786.html">RFC 1786</a> on the Representation of
   IP Routing Policies in the ripe-81++ Routing Registry.  In Appendices
   C the "changed" object parameter defines a format of &lt;email-address&gt;
   YYMMDD, and similarly in <a href="#appendix-D">Appendix D</a> "withdrawn" object identifier has
   he format of YYMMDD.  Since these are only identifiers there should
   be little operational impact.  Some application software may need to
   be modified.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.8" href="#section-3.8">3.8</a> "Security"</span>

   <a href="rfc1507.html">RFC 1507</a> on Distributed Authentication Security Services (DASS) use
   UTCTime.  Because of the imprecision of the UTC time definition there
   could be problems with this protocol.

   RFCs 1421-1424 specifies that PEM uses UTC time formats which could
   have a Millennium issue.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>. Summary of Other "Periodicity" Problems</span>

   By far, the largest area of "period" problems occurs in the year
   2038.  Many protocols use a 32-bit field to record the number of
   seconds since January 1, 1970.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>  "Name Serivces"</span>

   DNS Security uses 32-bit timestamps which will roll over in 2038.
   This issue has been refered to the appropriate Working Group so that
   the details of rollover can be established.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>  "Routing"</span>

   IDPR suffers from the classic Year 2038 problem, by having a
   timestamp counter which rolls over at that time.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>. Suggested Solutions</span>

   The real solution to the problem is to use 4 digit year fields for
   applications and hardware systems.  For counters that key off of a
   certain time (January 1, 1970 for example) need to either: define a
   wrapping solution, or to define a larger number space (greater than
   32-bits), or to make more efficient use of the 32-bit space. However,

   it will be impossible to completely replace currently deployed
   systems, so solutions for handling problems are in order.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a> Fixed Solution</span>

   A number of organizations and groups have suggested a fixed solution
   to the problem of two digit years.  Given a two-digit year YY, if YY
   is greater than or equal to 50, the year shall be interpreted as
   19YY; and where YY is less than 50, the year shall be intrepreted as
   20YY.

   While a simple and straightforward solution, it only pushes the
   problem off 40 to 50 years, until the artificially generated Year
   2050 problem needs to be addressed.  However, it is easy to implement
   and deploy, so it might be the most commonly adopted solution.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a> Sliding Window</span>

   Another solution is the "sliding window" approach.  In this approach,
   some value N is selected, and any two digit year that is less than or
   equal to the current two digit year plus N is considered the future,
   while any other two digit year is considered in the past.

   For example, choosing N equal to 10,  If the current year is 2012,
   and I get a two digit year that is any of 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
   19, 20, 21 or 22, assume it is 20YY (i.e. the future), otherwise
   consider it to be in the past(1923-1999, 2000-2011).

   This solution has two advantages.  First, no new fixed year problems
   are introduced.  Second, different applications and protocols could
   choose different values of N.  The drawback is that this solution is
   harder to implement, and to work well the value of N will need to be
   constant across different implementations.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>. Methodology</span>

   The first task was dividing the types of RFC's into logical groups
   rather than the strict numeric publishing order.  Sixteen specific
   areas were identified.  They are: "Autoconfiguration" , "Directory
   Services", "Disk Sharing", "Games and Chat" ,"Information Services &amp;
   File Transfer", "Network &amp; Transport Layer", "Electronic Mail",
   "NTP", Name Serving", "Network Management", "News", "Real Time
   Services", "Routing", "Security", "Virtual Terminal", and "Other".
   In addition to these categories, many hundreds of RFC's were
   immediately eliminated based on content.  That is not to say that all
   Informational RFC's were not considered, many did contain some
   technical content or overview whichdemanded scrutiny.




<span class="grey">Nesser                       Informational                      [Page 6]</span></pre>

   Each area was assigned to a team for investigation.  Although each
   team used whatever additional investigation techniques which seemed
   appropriate (including completely reading each RFC, and in some cases
   the source code for the reference implementation) at minimum each
   team used an automatic scanning system to search for the following
   items (case insensitively) in each RFC:

        - date
        - GMT
        - UTCTime
        - year
        - yy (that is not part of yyyy)
        - two-digit, 2-digit, 2digit
        - century
        - 1900 &amp; 2000

   Note that all of these strings except "UTCTime" may occur in
   conjunction with a date format that accommodates the Year 2000
   crossing, as well as with one that does not.  So "hits" on these
   string do not necessarily indicate Year 2000 problems: they simply
   identify elements that need to be examined.

   After the documents were scanned, therefore, each "hit" was examined
   individually.  Those that cause no Year 2000 problems (e.g., those
   that encode the year as a two-byte integer, or as a four-character
   display string) are not discussed here.  Those that do cause Year
   2000 problems are identified in this document, and the nature and
   impact of the problems they cause are described.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a> Summary</span>

   The RFC's which were categorized into this group were primarily the
   BOOT Protocol (BOOTP) and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   (DHCP) for both IP version four and six.

   Examination of the BOOTP protocols and most popular implementations
   show no year 2000 problems.  All times are references as 32 bit
   integers in seconds of UTC time.  An investigation of all DHCP and
   the IPv6 Autoconfiguration mechanisms produced no year 2000 problems.
   All references to time, in particular lease lengths, are 32 bit
   integers in seconds, allowing lease times of well over 100 years.

   no references to dates and time, or they are the same as the RFCs,
   which obsoleted them, discussed in the next paragraph.

   <a href="rfc1533.html">RFC 1533</a> enumerates all the known DHCP field types and a number of

   millennium issues.

   <a href="rfc1534.html">RFC 1534</a> has no references to times or dates.

   <a href="rfc1541.html">RFC 1541</a> has two mentions of times/dates.  The first is the "secs"
   field which, similarly to <a href="rfc951.html">RFC 951</a>, is a 16-bit field for the number

   <a href="#section-3.3">section 3.3</a> about "Interpretation and Representation of Time Values"
   which while clearly states that there is no millennium or period
   problems.

   <a href="rfc1542.html">RFC 1542</a> also references the "secs" field mentioned previously.

   The RFC's which were categorized into this group were primarily X.500
   related RFC's, Whois, Rwhois, Whois++, and the Lightweight Directory
   Access Protocol (LDAP).

   Upon review of the Directory Services related RFC's, no serious year
   2000 problems were discovered.  Some minor issues were noted and
   explained below in the specific portion of this section.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.2" href="#section-8.2">8.2</a> Specifics</span>

   RFCs that mentioned UTC Time or made reference to uTCTimeSyntax could
   fail to be Y2K compliant. These should be updated to specify the four
   year version of uTCTimeSyntax rather than giving the option of using
   a two-year date representation. The following RFCs fall into this
   category:

       <a href="rfc1274.html">rfc1274</a>.txt - References UTC date/time
       <a href="rfc1276.html">rfc1276</a>.txt - References UTC date/time for version control.
       <a href="rfc1488.html">rfc1488</a>.txt - References UTC Time as printable strings.
       <a href="rfc1608.html">rfc1608</a>.txt - Refers to uTCTimeSyntax
       <a href="rfc1609.html">rfc1609</a>.txt - Refers to uTCTimeSyntax
       <a href="rfc1778.html">rfc1778</a>.txt - Refers to uTCTimeSyntax

   Two RFC's have unusual date specifications and specify their own date
   format. Both of these support Y2K compliant dates.

   <a href="rfc1714.html">RFC1714</a> (RWhois) specifies date formats that are not Y2K compliant,
   but it also supports dates that are. Implementers of the RWhois
   protocol should only use the %MY4 format

   The references to time in this protocol are the times of file data
   modification, file access, and file metadata change (mtime, atime,
   and time, respectively).  These times are kept as 32 bit unsigned

   The RFC's which were categorized into this group were divided among
   World Wide Web (WWW) protocols and File Transfer Protocols (FTP).
   WWW protocols include the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a
   variety of Uniform Resource formats (URL, URAs, etc.) and the
   HyperText Markup Language(HTML).  FTP protocols include the well
   known FTP protocol, the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) and a
   variety of extensions to these protocols.  Other information services
   includes the Finger Protocol and the LPD protocol.

   HTTP 1.1, as defined in <a href="rfc2068.html">RFC 2068</a>, requires all newly generated date
   stamps to conform to <a href="rfc1123.html">RFC 1123</a> date formats which are Year 2000

   <a href="rfc850.html">RFC850</a> formats.  Some specific recommendations are listed below and
   have been passed to the HTTP WG.

   HTML 2.0, as defined in <a href="rfc1866.html">RFC 1866</a>, could allow a very subtle Year 2000

   <a href="#section-19.3">Section 19.3</a> of the <a href="rfc2068.html">RFC2068</a> says this:

        in the past (this helps solve the "year 2000" problem).

   This avoids a "stale cache" problem, which would cause the user to
   see out-of-date data.

   <a href="rfc1986.html">RFC 1986</a> documents experiments with a simple file transfer program
   over radio links using Enhanced Trivial FTP (ETFTP).  There are a

             CONTENT="Tue, 04 Dec 1993 21:29:02 GMT"&gt;

   Servers should rewrite these dates into <a href="rfc1123.html">RFC1123</a> format if necessary.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-13" href="#section-13">13</a>. Electronic Mail</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-13.1" href="#section-13.1">13.1</a> Summary</span>

   The RFC's which were categorized into this group were the Simple Mail
   Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP), Post
   Office Protocol (POP), Multipurpose Internet Mail Exchange (MIME),
   and X.400 to SMTP interaction.

   After reviewing all mail-related RFCs, it was discovered that while
   some obsolete standards required two-digit years, all currently used
   standards require four-digit years and are thus not prone to typical
   Year 2000 problems.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-13.2" href="#section-13.2">13.2</a> Specifics</span>

   RFCs 821 and 822, the main basis for SMTP mail exchange and message
   format, originally required two-digit years. However, both of these
   RFCs were later modified by <a href="rfc1123.html">RFC 1123</a> in 1989, which strongly
   recommended 4-digit years.  Although there might be a few very old
   SMTP systems using two-digit years, it is believed that almost all
   mail sent over the Internet today uses four-digit years. Mail that
   contains two-digit years in its SMTP headers will not "fail", but
   might be mis-sorted in message stores and mail user agents. This
   problem is avoided entirely by taking the <a href="rfc1123.html">RFC 1123</a> change as a
   requirement, rather than merely as a recommendation.

   IMAP versions 1, 2, and 3 used two-digit years, but IMAP version 4
   (defined in RFCs 1730 and 1732 in 1994) requires four-digit years.
   There are still a few IMAP 2 servers and clients in use on the
   Internet today, but IMAP version 4 has already taken over almost all
   of the IMAP market. Mail stored on an IMAP server or client with
   two-digit years will not "fail", but could possibly be mis-sorted or
   prematurely expired.

   <a href="rfc1153.html">RFC 1153</a> describes a format for digests of mailing lists, and uses
   two-digit dates. This format is not widely used. The use of two-digit
   dates could possibly cause missorting of stored messages.

   <a href="rfc1327.html">RFC 1327</a>, which describes mapping between X.400 mail and SMTP mail,
   uses the UTCTime format.

   <a href="rfc1422.html">RFC 1422</a> describes the structure of certificates that were used in
   PEM (and are expected to be used in many other mail and non-mail
   services). Those certificates use dates in UTCTime format. Poorly
   written software might prematurely expire or validate a certificate
   based on comparisons of the date with the current date, although no
   current software is known to do this.

   14. Network Time Protocols

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-14.1" href="#section-14.1">14.1</a> Summary</span>

   The RFC's which were categorized into this group were the Network
   Time Protocol (NTP), and the Time Protocol.

   NTP has been certified year 2000 compliant, while the Time Protocol
   will "roll over" at Thu Feb 07 00:54:54 2036 GMT.  Since NTP is the

   There is no reference anywhere in the NTP specification or
   implementation to any reference epoch other than 1 January 1900. In
   short, NTP doesn't know anything about the millennium.

   &gt;From the Time Protocol RFC (868):

       S: Send the time as a 32 bit binary number.

       ...

       The time is the number of seconds since 00:00 (midnight) 1 January
       1900 GMT, such that the time 1 is 12:00:01 am on 1 January 1900
       GMT; this base will serve until the year 2036.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-15.2" href="#section-15.2">15.2</a> Specifics</span>

   One is a common practice of writing serial numbers in zone files as
   if they represent a date, and using only two digits of the year.
   That practice cannot survive into the year 2000.  This is not a
   protocol problem, the serial number is simply an integer, and any
   value is OK, provided it always increases (see <a href="rfc1982.html">rfc1982</a> for a
   definition of what that means).  In any case, a change from 97abcd
   (or similar) to 00abcd would be a decrease and so is not permitted.
   Zone file maintainers have two choices, one easy (though irrational)
   one would be to continue from 99 to 100 and so on.  The other, is
   simply to switch, at any time between now and when the serial number
   first needs updating after the year 2000, to use 4 digits to
   represent the year instead of 2.  As long as there are no more than 6
   digits in the "abcd" part, and this is done sometime before the year
   2100, this is always an increase, and therefore always safe.  Should
   any zone files be of the form yyabcdefg (with 7 digits after a 2-
   digit year) then the procedures of <a href="rfc2182.html#section-7">section&nbsp;7 of rfc2182</a> should be
   adopted to convert the serial number to some other value.

   The other item of note is related to timestamps in DNS security.
   Those are represented as 32 bit counts of seconds, based in 1970, and
   hence have no year 2000 problems.  however, they do obviously have a
   natural end of life, and sometime before that time is reached, the
   definitions of those fields need to be corrected, perhaps to allow
   them to represent the number of seconds elapsed since the base,
   modulo 2^32, which is likely to be adequate for the purposes of DNS
   security (signatures and keys are unlikely to need to be valid for
   more than 70 years).  In any case, more work is needed in this area
   in the not too far distant future.

   The RFC's which were categorized into this group were the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP), a large number of Management
   Information Bases (MIBs) and the Common Management Information
   Protocol over TCP/IP (CMOT).

   Although a few discrepancies have been found and outlined below, none

   16.2.1 Use of GeneralizedTime in CMOT as defined in RFCs 1095 and
   1189.

   The standards for CMOT specify an unusual use for the GeneralizedTime
   type.  (GeneralizedTime has a four-digit representation of the year.)

   If the system generating the PDU does not have the current time, yet
   does have the time since last boot, then GeneralizedTime can be used
   to encode this information.  The time since last boot will be added
   to the base time "0001 Jan 1 00:00:00.00" using the Gregorian
   calendar algorithm.

   This is really a "Year 0" problem rather than a Year 2000 problem,
   and in any case, CMOT is not currently deployed.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-16.2.2" href="#section-16.2.2">16.2.2</a> UTCTime in SNMP Definitions</span>

   UTCTime is an ASN.1 type that includes a two-digit representation of
   the year.  There are several options for UTCTime in ASN.1, that vary
   in precision and in local versus GMT, but these options all have
   two-digit years.  The standards for SNMP definitions specify one
   particular format:

          YYMMDDHHMMZ

   The first usage of UTCTime in the standards for SNMP definitions goes
   all the way back to <a href="rfc1303.html">RFC 1303</a>.  It has persisted unchanged up through
   the current specifications in <a href="rfc1902.html">RFC 1902</a>.  The role of UTCTime in SNMP
   definitions is to record the history of an SNMP MIB module in the
   module itself, via two ASN.1 macros:

       o   LAST-UPDATED
       o   REVISION

   Management applications that store and use MIB modules need to be
   smart about interpreting these UTCTimes, by prepending a "19" or a
   "20" as appropriate.

   There are two objects in the Printer MIB that allow use of a date as
   an object value with no explicit guidance for formatting the value.
   The objects are prtInterpreterLangVersion and prtInterpreterVersion.
   Both are defined with a syntax of OCTET STRING.  The descriptions for
   the objects allow the object value to contain a date, version code or
   other product specific information to identify the interpreter or
   language.  The descriptions do not include an explicit statement
   recommending use of a four-digit year when a date is used as the
   object value.

Appendix B:  Automatic Script to Implement Methodology

#!/usr/bin/perl

# Program to read text files (such as RFCs and Internet Drafts) and
#    output items that might relate to year 2000 issues, particularly
#    2-digit years.

# Version 1.1a. Slight modification by Philip J. Nesser
#    (phil@nesser.com) to split lines from old RFC's that are
#    too wide to conform with current RFC standards.

# Version 1.1. By Paul Hoffman (phoffman@imc.org). This is a
#    quick-and-dirty hack and could be written more elegantly and
#    more efficiently. There may be bugs in this software. For
#    example, there was an off-by-one-line bug in version 1.0.
#    Use this code at your own risk. This code may be freely
#    redistributed.

# Some people like using disk files, others like STDIN and STDOUT.
#    This program accomodates both types by setting the $UsageType
#    variable. 'file' means input comes from the first argument on
#    the command line, output goes to that filename with a ".out"
#    extension; 'std' means STDIN and STDOUT.
$UsageType = 'file';  # Should be 'file' or 'std'

# @CheckWords is a list of words to look for. This list is used in
#    addition to the automatic checking for "yy" on a line without "YYYY".
#    You might want to add "year yyyy" to this list, but then a large
#    proportion of the RFCs and drafts get selected

@CheckWords = qw(UTCTime two-digit 2-digit 2digit century 1900 2000);

if($UsageType eq 'file') {
        if($ARGV[0] eq '')
                { die "You must specify the name of the file to open.\n" }
        $InName = $ARGV[0];
        unless(-r $InName) { die "Could not read $InName.\n" }
        open(IN, $InName) or die "Could not open $InName.\n";
        $OutName = "$InName.out";
        open(OUT, "&gt;$OutName") or die "Could not write to $OutName.\n";
        $OutStuff = '';  # Holder for what we're going to print out
} else {  # Do STDIN and STDOUT
        open(IN, "-"); open(OUT, "&gt;-");
}

# Read the whole file into an array. This is a tad wasteful of memory
#    but makes the output easier.

Appendix D:  Discussion of HTTP 1.0 Issues

   HTTP:

   The main IETF standards-track document on the HTTP protocol is
   <a href="rfc2068.html">RFC2068</a> on HTTP 1.1.  It notes that historically three different date
   formats have been used, and that one of them uses a two-digit year
   field.  In <a href="#section-3.3.1">section 3.3.1</a> it requires HTTP 1.1 implementations to
   generate this <a href="rfc1123.html">RFC1123</a> format:

        Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; <a href="rfc822.html">RFC 822</a>, updated by <a href="rfc1123.html">RFC 1123</a>

   instead of this <a href="rfc850.html">RFC850</a> format:

             Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; <a href="rfc850.html">RFC 850</a>, obsoleted by <a href="rfc1036.html">RFC</a>
        <a href="rfc1036.html">1036</a>

   Unfortunately, many existing servers, serving on the order of one
   fifth of the current HTTP traffic, send dates in the ambiguous <a href="rfc850.html">RFC850</a>
   format.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2626.html">RFC 2626</a>  The Internet and the Millennium Problem (Year 2000)  June 1999</span>


<a href="#section-19.3">Section 19.3</a> of the <a href="rfc2068.html">RFC2068</a> says this:

     o  HTTP/1.1 clients and caches should assume that an <a href="rfc850.html">RFC-850</a> date
        which appears to be more than 50 years in the future is in fact
        in the past (this helps solve the "year 2000" problem).

   This avoids a "stale cache" problem, which would cause the user to
   see out-of-date data.

   But to avoid unnecessary delays and bandwidth indicated in Scenario 2
   below, this should be extended to say that a date which appears to be
   more than 50 years in the past may be assumed to be in the future, if
   a future date is legal for that field.

   Scenario 3 indicates that servers may also want to follow these
   rules.

    Here is some more background and justification for these arguments.

   The following headers use full dates:

   HTTP/1.0:
           Date:
           Expires:                # can be in the future
           If-Modified-Since:      # required to be in the past
           Last-Modified:          # required to be in the past
           Retry-After:            # can be in the future, also takes
                                           # relative time - number of seconds

   HTTP/1.1:
           If-Range:
           If-Unmodified-Since:    # required to be in the past

   Note that clock skew between hosts can lead to confusion here - see
   the RFC for details.

   Here are some scenarios of the implications of <a href="rfc850.html">RFC850</a> dates, which
   include stale caches, unnecessary requests for things, which are
   validly cached, delays for the user, extra bandwidth, and presenting
   incorrect information to the user.

   Some cases involve comparisons with the current time, and others may
   involve comparisons between dates from different sources.  The
   abbreviation "/99" is used to imply an <a href="rfc850.html">RFC850</a> date with the value
   "99" for the year.

   <a href="rfc850.html">RFC850</a> date from server

   Scenario 1:
           If a client gets an Expires /99 date after the year 2000, it
           should interpret it as 1999, to avoid ending up with a stale
           cache entry.

           This is as already specified in <a href="rfc2068.html">RFC2068</a>.

   Scenario 2:
           If a client gets an Expires /00 date before the year 2000,
           and subsequently is faced with a choice to either retrieve
           the document from its cache or look for an updated copy, it
           may interpret it as the year 2000, to avoid the unnecessary
           delay and bandwidth of an extra request.

   <a href="rfc850.html">RFC850</a> date from client

   Scenario 3:
           If a server gets an If-Modified-Since /99 date from a client
           after the year 2000, it should interpret it as 1999 when
           comparing with the local modification date, in order to
           possibly avoid sending a full GET response rather than a HEAD
           response.

           Note that an If-Modified-Since header must never be in the
           future.
