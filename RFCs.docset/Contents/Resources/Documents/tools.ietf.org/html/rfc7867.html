   Multimedia applications often suffer from packet losses in IP
   networks.  In order to get a reasonable degree of quality when there
   is packet loss, it is necessary to have loss concealment mechanisms
   at the decoder.  Video loss concealment is a range of techniques to
   mask the effects of packet loss in video communications.

   In some applications, reporting the information of receivers applying
   video loss concealment could give monitors or senders useful
   information on the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the application.
   One example is no-reference video quality evaluation.  Video probes
   located upstream from the video endpoint or terminal may not see loss
   occurring between the probe and the endpoint, and also may not be
   fully aware of the specific loss concealment methods being
   dynamically applied by the video endpoint.  Evaluating error
   concealment is important in this circumstance to estimate the
   subjective impact of impairments.

   This document defines one new block type for video loss concealment
   to augment those defined in [<a href="rfc3611.html" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>] and [<a href="rfc7294.html" title='"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Blocks for Concealment Metrics Reporting on Audio Applications"'>RFC7294</a>] for use in a
   range of RTP video applications.  The metrics defined in this
   document belong to the class of transport-related terminal metrics
   defined in [<a href="rfc6792.html" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>].

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  [<a href="rfc3611.html" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>]
   defines an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block that
   is used as defined in [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>] and [<a href="rfc3611.html" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].

   The Performance Metrics Framework [<a href="rfc6390.html" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   monitoring framework [<a href="rfc6792.html" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>] provides guidelines for the reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The XR block type described in this
   document is in accordance with the guidelines in [<a href="rfc6390.html" title='"Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"'>RFC6390</a>] and
   [<a href="rfc6792.html" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>].

   These metrics are applicable to video applications the video
   component of audio/video applications using RTP and applying packet
   loss concealment mechanisms that are incorporated into the receiving
   endpoint to mitigate the impact of network impairments on QoE.  For
   example, in an IPTV system, set-top boxes could use this RTCP XR
   block to report loss and loss concealment metrics to an IPTV
   management system to enable the service provider to monitor the
   quality of the IPTV service being delivered to end users.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   Video loss concealment mechanisms can be classified into 4 types as
   follows:

   a) Frame freeze

      The impaired video frame is not displayed; instead, the previously
      displayed frame is frozen for the duration of the loss event.

   b) Interframe extrapolation

      If an area of the video frame is damaged by loss, the same area
      from the previous frame(s) can be used to estimate what the
      missing pixels would have been.  This can work well in a scene

      movement from one frame to another.  Simple decoders can simply
      reuse the pixels that were in the missing area, while more complex
      decoders can try to use several frames to do a more complex
      extrapolation.  Another example of a sophisticated form of
      interframe repair is to estimate the motion of the damaged region
      based on the motion of surrounding regions, and use that to select
      what part of the previous frame to use for repair.  Some important
      frames, such as Instantaneous Decoding Refresh (IDR) frames, may
      not depend on any other frames and may be involved in a scene
      change.  Using the interframe extrapolation method to conceal the
      loss of these frames may not obtain a satisfactory result.

   c) Interpolation

      A decoder uses the undamaged pixels in the video frame to estimate
      what the missing block of pixels should have.

   d) Error-resilient encoding

      The sender encodes the message in a redundant way so that the
      receiver can correct errors using the redundant information.
      There are usually two kinds of error-resilient encoding: One is
      that the redundant data useful for error resiliency performed at
      the decoder can be embedded into the compressed image/video
      bitstream.  The other is encoding at the bitstream level, e.g.,
      Forward Error Correction (FEC).

   Usually, methods b, c, and d are deployed together to provide
   comprehensive loss concealment in complex decoders, while method a is
   relatively independent and may be applied in some simple decoders.
   Moreover, the frame-freeze method repairs video based on frames,
   while the other methods repair video based on fine-grained elements,
   such as macroblocks or bitstreams; this will cause the measurement
   metrics of frame-freeze and the other methods to be slightly
   different.  Thus, In this document, we differentiate between frame-
   freeze and the other 3 loss concealment mechanisms.

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits

      A Video Loss Concealment Report Block is identified by the
      constant 34.

   Interval Metric Flag (I): 2 bits

      This field indicates whether the reported metrics are interval,
      cumulative, or sampled metrics [<a href="rfc6792.html" title='"Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring Framework"'>RFC6792</a>]:

         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
               most recent measurement interval duration between
               successive metrics reports.

         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
               accumulation period characteristic of cumulative
               measurements.

         I=01: Sampled Value - this value MUST NOT be used for this

   Video Loss Concealment Method Type (V): 2 bits

      This field is used to identify the video loss concealment method
      type used at the receiver.  The value is defined as follows:

         V=10: Frame-freeze
         V=11: Other Loss Concealment Method
         V=01 and V=00: Reserved

      If frame-freeze and another loss concealment method are used
      together for the media stream, two report blocks (one with V=10
      for frame freeze and one with V=11 for the other loss concealment
      method) SHOULD be compounded together to report complete
      concealment information.

   RSV: 4 bits

      These bits are reserved for future use.  They MUST be set to zero
      by senders and ignored by receivers (see <a href="rfc6709.html#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of
      [RFC6709]</a>).

   Block Length: 16 bits

      This field is in accordance with the definition in [<a href="rfc3611.html" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].  In
      this report block, it MUST be set to 5 when V=10 and set to 4 when
      V=11.  The block MUST be discarded if the block length is set to a
      different value.

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      As defined in <a href="rfc3611.html#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of [RFC3611]</a>.

   Impaired Duration: 32 bits

      The total duration, expressed in units of RTP timestamp from the
      sending side of the reporting block, of video impaired by
      transmission loss before applying any loss concealment methods.

      Two values are reserved: A value of 0xFFFFFFFE indicates out of
      range (that is, a measured value exceeding 0xFFFFFFFD), and a
      value of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates that the measurement is unavailable.

   Concealed Duration: 32 bits

      The total duration, expressed in units of RTP timestamp from the
      sending side of the reporting block, of concealed damaged video
      pictures on which the loss concealment method corresponding to the
      Video Loss Concealment Method Type is applied.

      Two values are reserved: A value of 0xFFFFFFFE indicates out of
      range (that is, a measured value exceeding 0xFFFFFFFD), and a
      value of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates that the measurement is unavailable.

   Mean Frame-Freeze Duration: 32 bits

      Mean Frame-Freeze Duration is the mean duration, expressed in
      units of RTP timestamp from the sending side of the reporting
      block, of the frame-freeze events.  The value of Mean Frame-Freeze
      Duration is calculated by summing the total duration of all frame
      freeze events and dividing by the number of events.  This metric
      is optional.  It only exists when Video Loss Concealment Method
      Type=10.

   Mean Impaired Frame Proportion (MIFP): 8 bits

      Mean Impaired Frame Proportion is the mean proportion of each
      video frame impaired by loss before applying any loss concealment
      method during the interval, expressed as a fixed-point number with
      the binary point at the left edge of the field.  It is calculated
      by summing the impaired proportion of each video frame and
      dividing by the number of frames during this period.  The impaired
      proportion of each video frame is obtained by dividing the number
      of missing macroblocks from this video frame by the total
      macroblock number of the video frame, which is equivalent to
      multiplying the result of the division by 256, limiting the
      maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking the integer
      part.

      If a video frame is totally lost, a value of 0xFF SHOULD be used
      for the frame when calculating the MIFP.

   Mean Concealed Frame Proportion (MCFP): 8 bits

      Mean Concealed Frame Proportion is the mean proportion of each
      video frame to which loss concealment (depicted as "V" in the
      definition of "Video Loss Concealment Method Type") was applied
      during the interval, expressed as a fixed-point number with the
      binary point at the left edge of the field.  It is calculated by
      summing the concealed proportion of each video frame and dividing
      by the number of frames during this period.  The concealed
      proportion of each video frame is obtained by dividing the number
      of concealed macroblocks from this video frame by the total
      macroblock number of the video frame, which is equivalent to
      multiplying the result of the division by 256, limiting the
      maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking the integer
      part.

      When calculating the MCFP, a value of 0xFF SHOULD be used for a
      lost frame that is totally concealed, and a value of 0 SHOULD be
      used for the frame if there are no concealed macroblocks in it.
      For Video Loss Concealment Method Type=10, each frame covered in
      the period of frame freeze is considered to be totally concealed;
      this means a value of 0xFF MUST be assigned.

   Fraction of Frames Subject to Concealment (FFSC): 8 bits

      Fraction of Frames Subject to Concealment is calculated by
      dividing the number of frames to which loss concealment (using
      Video Loss Concealment Method Type) was applied by the total
      number of frames and expressing this value as a fixed-point number
      with the binary point at the left edge of the field.  It is
      equivalent to multiplying the result of the division by 256,
      limiting the maximum value to 255 (to avoid overflow), and taking
      the integer part.

      A value of 0 indicates that there were no concealed frames, and a
      value of 0xFF indicates that the frames in the entire measurement
      interval are all concealed.

   Reserved: 8 bits

      These bits are reserved for future use.  They MUST be set to zero
      by senders and ignored by receivers (see <a href="rfc6709.html#section-4.2">Section 4.2 of

   It is believed that this RTCP XR block introduces no new security
   considerations beyond those described in [<a href="rfc3611.html" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].  This block does
   not provide per-packet statistics, so the risk to confidentiality
   documented in paragraph 3 of <a href="rfc3611.html#section-7">Section 7 of [RFC3611]</a> does not apply.

   An attacker is likely to put incorrect information in the Video Loss
   Concealment reports; this will affect the estimation of the
   performance of video loss concealment mechanisms and the QoE of
   users.  Implementers SHOULD consider the guidance in [<a href="rfc7202.html" title='"Securing the RTP Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution"'>RFC7202</a>] for
   using appropriate security mechanisms, i.e., where security is a
   concern, the implementation SHOULD apply encryption and
   authentication to the report block.  For example, this can be
   achieved by using the AVPF profile together with the Secure RTP
   profile as defined in [<a href="rfc3711.html" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>]; an appropriate combination of the
   two profiles (an "SAVPF") is specified in [<a href="rfc5124.html" title='"Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)"'>RFC5124</a>].  However, other
   mechanisms also exist (documented in [<a href="rfc7201.html" title='"Options for Securing RTP Sessions"'>RFC7201</a>]) and might be more
   suitable.
