   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [<a href="#ref-1" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>1</a>] user agents vary widely in
   their capabilities and in the types of devices they represent.
   Frequently, it is important for another SIP element to learn the
   capabilities and characteristics of a SIP UA.  Some of the
   applications of this information include:

   o  One user agent, a PC-based application, is communicating with
      another that is embedded in a limited-function device.  The PC
      would like to be able to "grey out" those components of the user
      interface that represent features or capabilities not supported by
      its peer.  To do that, there needs to be a way to exchange
      capability information within a dialog.

   o  A user has two devices at their disposal.  One is a videophone,
      and the other, a voice-only wireless phone.  A caller wants to
      interact with the user using video.  As such, they would like
      their call preferentially routed to the device which supports
      video.  To do this, the INVITE request can contain parameters that
      express a preference for routing to a device with the specified
      capabilities [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Caller Preferences for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>11</a>].

   o  A network application would like to asynchronously send
      information to a user agent in a MESSAGE [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Instant Messaging"'>16</a>] request.  However,
      before sending it, they would like to know if the UA has the
      capabilities necessary to receive the message.  To do that, they
      would ideally query a user database managed by the domain which
      holds such information.  Population of such a database would
      require that a UA convey its capabilities as part of its
      registration.  Thus, there is a need for conveying capabilities in
      REGISTER requests.

   SIP has some support for expression of capabilities.  The Allow,
   Accept, Accept-Language, and Supported header fields convey some
   information about the capabilities of a user agent.  However, these
   header fields convey only a small part of the information that is
   needed.  They do not provide a general framework for expression of
   capabilities.  Furthermore, they only specify capabilities
   indirectly; the header fields really indicate the capabilities of the
   UA as they apply to this request.  SIP also has no ability to convey
   characteristics, that is, information that describes a UA.

   As a result, this specification provides a more general framework for
   an indication of capabilities and characteristics in SIP.  Capability
   and characteristic information about a UA is carried as parameters of

   Feature: As defined in <a href="rfc2703.html">RFC 2703</a> [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Protocol-independent Content Negotiation Framework"'>17</a>], a piece of information about
      the media handling properties of a message passing system
      component or of a data resource.  For example, the SIP methods
      supported by a UA represent a feature.

   Feature Tag: As defined in <a href="rfc2703.html">RFC 2703</a> [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Protocol-independent Content Negotiation Framework"'>17</a>], a feature tag is a name
      that identifies a feature.  An example is "sip.methods".

   Media Feature: As defined in <a href="rfc2703.html">RFC 2703</a>, [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Protocol-independent Content Negotiation Framework"'>17</a>], a media feature is
      information that indicates facilities assumed to be available for
      the message content to be properly rendered or otherwise
      presented.  Media features are not intended to include information
      that affects message transmission.

      In the context of this specification, a media feature is
      information that indicates facilities for handling SIP requests,
      rather than specifically for content.  In that sense, it is used
      synonymously with feature.

   Feature Collection: As defined in <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A Syntax for Describing Media Feature Sets"'>4</a>], a feature collection
      is a collection of different media features and associated values.
      This might be viewed as describing a specific rendering of a
      specific instance of a document or resource by a specific
      recipient.

   Feature Set: As defined in <a href="rfc2703.html">RFC 2703</a> [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Protocol-independent Content Negotiation Framework"'>17</a>], a feature set is
      information about a sender, recipient, or other participant in a
      message transfer which describes the set of features that it can
      handle.  Where a 'feature' describes a single identified attribute
      of a resource, a 'feature set' describes a full set of possible
      attributes.

   Feature Parameters: A set of SIP header field parameters that can
      appear in the Contact header field.  The feature parameters
      represent an encoding of a feature set.  Each set of feature
      parameters maps to a feature set predicate.

   Capability: As defined in <a href="rfc2703.html">RFC 2703</a> [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Protocol-independent Content Negotiation Framework"'>17</a>], a capability is an attribute
      of a sender or receiver (often the receiver) which indicates an
      ability to generate or process a particular type of message
      content.  A capability is distinct from a characteristic in that a
      capability may or may not be utilized in any particular call,
      whereas a characteristic is a non-negotiable property of a UA.
      SIP itself will often negotiate whether or not capabilities are
      used in a call.

   Characteristic: A characteristic is like a capability, but describes
      an aspect of a UA which is not negotiable.  As an example, whether
      or not a UA is a mobile phone is a characteristic, not a
      capability.  The semantics of this specification do not
      differentiate between capability and characteristic, but the
      distinction is useful for illustrative purposes.  Indeed, in the
      text below, when we say "capability", it refers to both
      capabilities and characteristics, unless the text explicitly says
      otherwise.

   Filter: A single expression in a feature set predicate.

   Simple Filter: An expression in a feature set predicate which is a
      comparison (equality or inequality) of a feature tag against a
      feature value.

   Disjunction: A boolean OR operation across some number of terms.

   Conjunction: A boolean AND operation across some number of terms.

   Predicate: A boolean expression.

   Feature Set Predicate: From <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A Syntax for Describing Media Feature Sets"'>4</a>], a feature set predicate is
      a function of an arbitrary feature collection value which returns
      a Boolean result.  A TRUE result is taken to mean that the
      corresponding feature collection belongs to some set of media
      feature handling capabilities defined by this predicate.

   Contact Predicate: The feature set predicate associated with a URI
      registered in the Contact header field of a REGISTER request.  The
      contact predicate is derived from the feature parameters in the
      Contact header field.

   This specification makes heavy use of the terminology and concepts in
   the content negotiation work carried out within the IETF, and
   documented in several RFCs.  The ones relevant to this specification
   are <a href="rfc2506.html">RFC 2506</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Media Feature Tag Registration Procedure"'>3</a>], which provides a template for registering media
   feature tags, <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A Syntax for Describing Media Feature Sets"'>4</a>], which presents a syntax and matching
   algorithm for media feature sets, <a href="rfc2738.html">RFC 2738</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Corrections to "'>5</a>], which provides a
   minor update to <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a>, and <a href="rfc2703.html">RFC 2703</a> [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Protocol-independent Content Negotiation Framework"'>17</a>], which provides a general
   framework for content negotiation.

   In case the reader does not have the time to read those
   specifications, <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> provides a brief overview of the concepts
   and terminology in those documents that is critical for understanding
   this specification.

   Since the content negotiation work was primarily meant to apply to
   documents or other resources with a set of possible renderings, it is
   not immediately apparent how it is used to model SIP user agents.  A
   feature set is composed of a set of feature collections, each of
   which represents a specific rendering supported by the entity
   described by the feature set.  In the context of a SIP user agent, a
   feature collection represents an instantaneous modality.  That is, if
   you look at the run time processing of a SIP UA and take a snapshot
   in time, the feature collection describes what it is doing at that
   very instant.

   This model is important, since it provides guidance on how to
   determine whether something is a value for a particular feature tag,
   or a feature tag by itself.  If two properties can be exhibited by a
   UA simultaneously so that both are present in an instantaneous
   modality, they need to be represented by separate media feature tags.
   For example, a UA may be able to support some number of media types -
   audio, video, and control.  Should each of these be different values
   for a single "media-types" feature tag, or should each of them be a
   separate boolean feature tag?  The model provides the answer.  Since,
   at any instance in time, a UA could be handling both audio and video,
   they need to be separate media feature tags.  However, the SIP
   methods supported by a UA can each be represented as different values
   for the same media feature tag (the "sip.methods" tag), because
   fundamentally, a UA processes a single request at a time.  It may be
   multi-threading, so that it appears that this is not so, but at a
   purely functional level, it is true.

   Clearly, there are weaknesses in this model, but it serves as a
   useful guideline for applying the concepts of <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> to the problem
   at hand.

   To construct a set of Contact header field parameters that indicate
   capabilities, a UA constructs a feature predicate for that contact.
   This process is described in terms of <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A Syntax for Describing Media Feature Sets"'>4</a>] (and its minor
   update, <a href="rfc2738.html">RFC 2738</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Corrections to "'>5</a>]) syntax and constructs, followed by a conversion
   to the syntax used in this specification.  However, this represents a
   logical flow of processing.  There is no requirement that an
   implementation actually use <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> syntax as an intermediate step.

   A UA MAY use any feature tags that are registered through IANA in the
   SIP tree (Established in <a href="#section-12.1">Section 12.1</a>), IETF, or global trees [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Media Feature Tag Registration Procedure"'>3</a>];
   this document registers several into the SIP tree.  The feature tags
   discussed in this specification are referred to as base tags.  While
   other tags can be used, in order to identify them as feature
   parameters (as opposed to parameters for another SIP extension), they
   are encoded with a leading "+" sign in the Contact header field.  It
   is also permissible to use the URI tree [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Media Feature Tag Registration Procedure"'>3</a>] for expressing vendor-
   specific feature tags.  Feature tags in any other trees created
   through IANA MAY also be used.

   When using the "sip.methods" feature tag, a UA MUST NOT include
   values that correspond to methods not standardized in IETF standards
   track RFCs.  When using the "sip.events" feature tag, a UA MUST NOT
   include values that correspond to event packages not standardized in
   IETF standards track RFCs.  When using the "sip.schemes" feature tag,
   a UA MUST NOT include values that correspond to schemes not
   standardized in IETF standards track RFCs.  When using the
   "sip.extensions" feature tag, a UA MUST NOT include values that
   correspond to option tags not standardized in IETF standards track
   RFCs.

   Note that the "sip.schemes" feature tag does not indicate the scheme
   of the registered URI.  Rather, it indicates schemes that a UA is
   capable of sending requests to, should such a URI be received in a
   web page or Contact header field of a redirect response.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a UA provide complete information in its
   contact predicate.  That is, it SHOULD provide information on as many
   feature tags as possible.  The mechanisms in this specification work
   best when user agents register complete feature sets.  Furthermore,
   when a UA registers values for a particular feature tag, it MUST list
   all values that it supports.  For example, when including the
   "sip.methods" feature tag, a UA MUST list all methods it supports.

   The contact predicate constructed by a UA MUST be an AND of terms
   (called a conjunction).  Each term is either an OR (called a
   disjunction) of simple filters or negations of simple filters, or a

   single simple filter or negation of a single filter.  In the case of
   a disjunction, each filter in the disjunction MUST indicate feature
   values for the same feature tag (i.e., the disjunction represents a
   set of values for a particular feature tag), while each element of
   the conjunction MUST be for a different feature tag.  Each simple
   filter can be an equality, or in the case of numeric feature tags, an
   inequality or range.   If a string (as defined in <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A Syntax for Describing Media Feature Sets"'>4</a>]) is
   used as the value of a simple filter, that value MUST NOT include the
   "&lt;" or "&gt;" characters, the simple filter MUST NOT be negated, and it
   MUST be the only simple filter for that particular feature tag.  This
   contact predicate is then converted to a list of feature parameters,
   following the procedure outlined below.

   The contact predicate is a conjunction of terms.  Each term indicates
   constraints on a single feature tag, and each term is represented by
   a separate feature parameter that will be present in the Contact
   header field.  The syntax of this parameter depends on the feature
   tag.  Each forward slash in the feature tag is converted to a single
   quote, and each colon are converted to an exclamation point.  For the
   base tags - that is, those feature tags documented in this
   specification (sip.audio, sip.automata, sip.class, sip.duplex,
   sip.data, sip.control, sip.mobility, sip.description, sip.events,
   sip.priority, sip.methods, sip.extensions, sip.schemes,
   sip.application, sip.video, language, type, sip.isfocus, sip.actor
   and sip.text), the leading "sip.", if present, is stripped.  For
   feature tags not in this list, the leading "sip." MUST NOT be
   stripped if present, and indeed, a plus sign ("+") MUST be added as
   the first character of the Contact header field parameter.  The
   result is the feature parameter name.  As a result of these rules,
   the base tags appear "naked" in the Contact header field - they have
   neither a "+" nor a "sip." prefix.  All other tags will always have a
   leading "+" when present in the Contact header field, and will
   additionally have a "sip." if the tag is in the SIP tree.

   The value of the feature parameter depends on the term of the
   conjunction.  If the term is a boolean expression with a value of
   true, i.e., (sip.audio=TRUE), the contact parameter has no value.  If
   the term of the conjunction is a disjunction, the value of the
   contact parameter is a quoted string.  The quoted string is a comma
   separated list of strings, each one derived from one of the terms in
   the disjunction.  If the term of the conjunction is a negation, the
   value of the contact parameter is a quoted string.  The quoted string
   begins with an exclamation point (!), and the remainder is
   constructed from the expression being negated.

   The remaining operation is to compute a string from a primitive
   filter. If the filter is a simple filter that is performing a numeric
   comparison, the string starts with an octothorpe (#), followed by the

   comparator in the filter (=, &gt;=, or &lt;=), followed by the value from
   the filter.  If the value from the filter is expressed in rational
   form (X / Y), then X and Y are divided, yielding a decimal number,
   and this decimal number is output to the string.

      <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> uses a fractional notation to describe rational numbers.
      This specification uses a decimal form.  The above text merely
      converts between the two representations.  Practically speaking,
      this conversion is not needed since the numbers are the same in
      either case.  However, it is described in case implementations
      wish to directly plug the predicates generated by the rules in
      this section into an <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> implementation.

   If the filter is a range (foo=X..Y), the string is equal to X:Y,
   where X and Y have been converted from fractional numbers (A / B) to
   their decimal equivalent.

   If the filter is an equality over a token or boolean, then that token
   or boolean value ("TRUE" or "FALSE") is output to the string.

   If the filter is an equality over a quoted string, the output is a
   less than (&lt;), followed by the quoted string, followed by a greater
   than (&gt;).

   As an example, this feature predicate:

   (&amp; (sip.mobility=fixed)
      (| (! (sip.events=presence)) (sip.events=message-summary))
      (| (language=en) (language=de))
      (sip.description="PC")
      (sip.newparam=TRUE)
      (rangeparam=-4..5125/1000))

   would be converted into the following feature parameters:

   mobility="fixed";events="!presence,message-summary";language="en,de"
      ;description="&lt;PC&gt;";+sip.newparam;+rangeparam="#-4:+5.125"

   These feature tags would then appear as part of the Contact header
   field:

   Contact: &lt;sip:user@pc.example.com&gt;
             ;mobility="fixed";events="!presence,message-summary"
             ;language="en,de";description="&lt;PC&gt;"
             ;+sip.newparam;+rangeparam="#-4:+5.125"

   Notice how the leading "sip." was stripped from the sip.mobility,
   sip.events and sip.description feature tags before encoding them in

   the Contact header field.  This is because these feature tags are
   amongst the base tags listed above.  It is for this reason that these
   feature tags were not encoded with a leading "+" either.  However,
   the sip.newparam feature tag was encoded with both the "+" and its
   leading "sip.", and the rangeparam was also encoded with a leading
   "+".  This is because neither of these feature tags are defined in
   this specification.  As such, the leading "sip." is not stripped off,
   and a "+" is added.

   When a UA registers, it can choose to indicate a feature set
   associated with a registered contact.  Whether or not a UA does so
   depends on what the registered URI represents.  If the registered URI
   represents a UA instance (the common case in registrations), a UA
   compliant to this specification SHOULD indicate a feature set using
   the mechanisms described here.  If, however, the registered URI
   represents an address-of-record, or some other resource that is not
   representable by a single feature set, it SHOULD NOT include a
   feature set.  As an example, if a user wishes to forward calls from
   sip:user1@example.com to sip:user2@example.org, it could generate a
   registration that looks like, in part:

   REGISTER sip:example.com SIP/2.0
   To: sip:user1@example.com
   Contact: sip:user2@example.org

   In this case, the registered contact is not identifying a UA, but
   rather, another address-of-record.  In such a case, the registered
   contact would not indicate a feature set.

   However, in some cases, a UA may wish to express feature parameters
   for an address-of-record.  One example is an AOR which represents a
   multiplicity of devices in a home network, and routes to a proxy
   server in the user's home.  Since all devices in the home are for
   personal use, the AOR itself can be described with the
   ;class="personal" feature parameter.  A registration that forwards
   calls to this home AOR could make use of that feature parameter.
   Generally speaking, a feature parameter can only be associated with
   an address-of-record if all devices bound to that address-of-record
   share the exact same set of values for that feature parameter.

   Similarly, in some cases, a UA can exhibit one characteristic or
   another, but the characteristic is not known in advance.  For
   example, a UA could represent a device that is a phone with an
   embedded answering machine.  The ideal way to treat such devices is
   to model them as if they were actually a proxy fronting two devices -
   a phone (which is never an answering machine), and an answering

   machine (which is never a phone).  The registration from this device
   would be constructed as if it were an AOR, as per the procedures
   above.  Generally, this means that, unless the characteristic is
   identical between the logical devices, that characteristic will not
   be present in any registration generated by the actual device.

   The remainder of this section assumes that a UA would like to
   associate a feature set with a contact that it is registering.  This
   feature set is constructed and converted to a series of Contact
   header field parameters, as described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>, and those feature
   parameters are added to the Contact header field value containing the
   URI to which the parameters apply.  The Allow, Accept, Accept-
   Language and Allow-Events [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification"'>9</a>] header fields are allowed in REGISTER
   requests, and also indicate capabilities.  However, their semantic in
   REGISTER is different, indicating capabilities, used by the
   registrar, for generation of the response.  As such, they are not a
   substitute or an alternate for the Contact feature parameters, which
   indicate the capabilities of the UA generally speaking.

   The REGISTER request MAY contain a Require header field with the
   value "pref" if the client wants to be sure that the registrar
   understands the extensions defined in this specification.  This means
   that the registrar will store the feature parameters, and make them
   available to elements accessing the location service within the
   domain.  In the absence of the Require header field, a registrar that
   does not understand this extension will simply ignore the Contact
   header field parameters.

   If a UA registers against multiple separate addresses-of-record, and
   the contacts registered for each have different capabilities, a UA
   MUST use different URIs in each registration.  This allows the UA to
   uniquely determine the feature set that is associated with the
   request URI of an incoming request.

   As an example, a voicemail server that is a UA that supports audio
   and video media types and is not mobile would construct a feature
   predicate like this:

   (&amp; (sip.audio=TRUE)
      (sip.video=TRUE)
      (sip.actor=msg-taker)
      (sip.automata=TRUE)
      (sip.mobility=fixed)
      (| (sip.methods=INVITE) (sip.methods=BYE) (sip.methods=OPTIONS)
         (sip.methods=ACK) (sip.methods=CANCEL)))

   These would be converted into feature parameters and included in the
   REGISTER request:

   REGISTER sip:example.com SIP/2.0
   From: sip:user@example.com;tag=asd98
   To: sip:user@example.com

     ;actor="msg-taker";automata;mobility="fixed"
     ;methods="INVITE,BYE,OPTIONS,ACK,CANCEL"
   Content-Length: 0

   Note that a voicemail server is usually an automata and a message
   taker.

   When a UAC refreshes its registration, it MUST include its feature
   parameters in that refresh if it wishes for them to remain active.
   Furthermore, when a registrar returns a 200 OK response to a REGISTER
   request, each Contact header field value MUST include all of the
   feature parameters associated with that URI.

   Target refresh requests and responses are used to establish and
   modify the remote target URI in a dialog.  The remote target URI is
   conveyed in the Contact header field.  A UAC or UAS MAY add feature
   parameters to the Contact header field value in target refresh
   requests and responses for the purpose of indicating the capabilities
   of the UA.  To do that, it constructs a set of feature parameters
   according to <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  These are then added as Contact header field
   parameters in the request or response.

   The feature parameters can be included in both initial requests and
   mid-dialog requests, and MAY change mid-dialog to signal a change in
   UA capabilities.

   There is overlap in the callee capabilities mechanism with the Allow,
   Accept, Accept-Language, and Allow-Events [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification"'>9</a>] header fields, which
   can also be used in target refresh requests.  Specifically, the Allow
   header field and "sip.methods" feature tag indicate the same
   information.  The Accept header field and the "type" feature tag
   indicate the same information.  The Accept-Language header field and
   the "language" feature tag indicate the same information.  The
   Allow-Events header field and the "sip.events" feature tag indicate
   the same information.  It is possible that other header fields and

   feature tags defined in the future may also overlap.  When there
   exists a feature tag that describes a capability that can also be
   represented with a SIP header field, a UA MUST use the header field
   to describe the capability.  A UA receiving a message that contains
   both the header field and the feature tag MUST use the header field,
   and not the feature tag.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.%20%20OPTIONS%20Processing"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" name="section-8">8</a>.  OPTIONS Processing</span>

   When a UAS compliant to this specification receives an OPTIONS
   request, it MAY add feature parameters to the Contact header field in
   the OPTIONS response for the purpose of indicating the capabilities
   of the UA.  To do that, it constructs a set of feature parameters
   according to <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.  These are then added as Contact header field
   parameters in OPTIONS response.  Indeed, if feature parameters were
   included in the registration generated by that UA, those same
   parameters SHOULD be used in the OPTIONS response.

   The guidelines in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> regarding the overlap of the various
   callee capabilities feature tags with SIP header fields applies to
   the generation of OPTIONS responses as well.  In particular, they
   apply when a Contact header field is describing the UA which
   generated the OPTIONS response.  When a Contact header field in the
   OPTIONS response is identifying a different UA, there is no overlap.

   This specification extends the Contact header field.  In particular,
   it allows for the Contact header field parameters to include
   feature-param.  Feature-param is a feature parameter that describes a
   feature of the UA associated with the URI in the Contact header
   field.  Feature parameters are identifiable because they either
   belong to the well known set of base feature tags, or they begin with
   a plus sign.

   feature-param    =  enc-feature-tag [EQUAL LDQUOT (tag-value-list

   This specification defines an initial set of media feature tags for
   use with this specification.  This section serves as the IANA
   registration for these feature tags, which are made into the SIP
   media feature tag tree.  New media feature tags are registered in the
   IETF or global trees based on the process defined for feature tag
   registrations [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Media Feature Tag Registration Procedure"'>3</a>], or in the SIP tree based on the process defined in
   <a href="#section-12.1">Section 12.1</a>.

   Any registered feature tags MAY be used with this specification.
   However, several existing ones appear to be particularly applicable.
   These include the language feature tag [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Registration of Charset and Languages Media Features Tags"'>6</a>], which can be used to
   specify the language of the human or automata represented by the UA,
   and the type feature tag [<a href="#ref-7" title='"MIME Content Types in Media Feature Expressions"'>7</a>], which can be used to specify the MIME
   types that a SIP UA can receive in a SIP message.  The audio, video,
   application, data, and control feature tags in the SIP tree (each of
   which indicate a media type, as defined in <a href="rfc2327.html">RFC 2327</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>8</a>]) are
   different.  They do not indicate top level MIME types which can be

   received in SIP requests.  Rather, they indicate media types that can
   be used in media streams, and as a result, match up with the types
   defined in <a href="rfc2327.html">RFC 2327</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>8</a>].

   If a new SDP media type were to be defined, such as "message", a new
   feature tag registration SHOULD be created for it in the SIP tree.
   The name of the feature tag MUST equal "sip." concatenated with the
   name of the media type, unless there is an unlikely naming collision
   between the new media type and an existing feature tag registration.
   As a result, implementations can safely construct caller preferences
   and callee capabilities for the new media type before it is
   registered, as long as there is no naming conflict.

   If a new media feature tag is registered with the intent of using
   that tag with this specification, the registration is done for the
   unencoded form of the tag (see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>).  In other words, if a new
   feature tag "foo" is registered in the IETF tree, the IANA
   registration would be for the tag "foo" and not "+foo".  Similarly,
   if a new feature tag "sip.gruu" is registered in the SIP tree, the
   IANA registration would be for the tag "sip.gruu" and not "+sip.gruu"
   or "gruu".  As such, all registrations into the SIP tree will have
   the "sip." prefix.

   The feature tags in this section are all registered in the SIP media
   feature tag tree created by <a href="#section-12.1">Section 12.1</a>.

   The media feature tags defined in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a> reveal sensitive
   information about a user or the user agent they are describing.  Some
   of the feature tags convey capability information about the agent -
   for example, the media types it can support, the SIP methods it can
   support, and the SIP extensions it can support.  This capability
   information might be used for industrial espionage, for example, and
   so its protection may be important.  Other attributes, such as the
   mobility, priority, and isfocus attributes, reveal characteristics of
   the user agent.  These attributes are more sensitive than the
   capability information.  They describe the way in which a user agent
   is utilized by a user, and thus reveal information about user
   preferences and the ways in which they want calls handled.  Some
   feature tags, such as languages, reveal information about the user
   themself.  As a result, applications which utilize these media
   feature tags SHOULD provide a means for ensuring their
   confidentiality.

   The media feature tags can be used in ways which affect application
   behaviors.  For example, the SIP caller preferences extension [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Caller Preferences for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>11</a>]
   allows for call routing decisions to be based on the values of these
   parameters.  Therefore, if an attacker can modify the values of these
   feature tags, they may be able to affect the behavior of
   applications.  As a result of this, applications which utilize these
   media feature tags SHOULD provide a means for ensuring their
   integrity.  Similarly, media feature tags should only be trusted as
   valid when they come from the user or user agent described by those
   feature tags.  As a result, mechanisms for conveying feature tags
   SHOULD provide a mechanism for guaranteeing authenticity.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.2.%20%20Considerations%20for%20Registrations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.2" name="section-11.2">11.2</a>.  Considerations for Registrations</span>

   As per the general requirements in <a href="#section-11.1">Section 11.1</a>, when media feature
   tags are carried in a registration, authenticity, confidentiality,
   and integrity need to be provided.  To accomplish this, registrations
   containing capability information SHOULD be made by addressing the
   registration to a SIPS URI (in other words, the Request URI of the
   request would be sips:example.com when creating a registration in the
   example.com domain).  Furthermore, the registrar SHOULD challenge the
   UA using digest over TLS, to verify its authenticity.  The
   combination of TLS and digest provide integrity, confidentiality, and
   authenticity, as required.

   It is not necessary for the Contact in the registration to itself
   contain a sips URI, since the feature tags are not carried in
   incoming requests sent to the UA.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.3.%20%20Considerations%20for%20OPTIONS%20Responses"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11.3" name="section-11.3">11.3</a>.  Considerations for OPTIONS Responses</span>

   When including information on capabilities in a response to an
   OPTIONS request, a UA SHOULD verify with the user (either through a
   user interface or though prior configuration) whether or not
   capability information should be divulged to the requester.  If the
   identity of the requester cannot be cryptographically verified (using
   digest or the SIP identity enhancements [<a href="#ref-15" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>15</a>]), the user SHOULD also
   be alerted to this fact, and be allowed to choose whether such
   information should be divulged.

   If the user does wish to reveal capability information to the
   requester, and wishes to guarantee its confidentiality, but the
   request did not arrive using SIPS, the UAS SHOULD redirect the
   request to a sips URI.  This will cause the UAC to send the OPTIONS
   request using SIPS instead, and therefore provide confidentiality of
   any responses sent over the secure connections.

   Furthermore, S/MIME MAY be used in the OPTIONS response.  In that
   case, the capability information would be contained only in the
   secured S/MIME body, and not in the header fields of the OPTIONS
   response.

   When a UAS generates a response that will initiate a dialog, and they
   wish to include capability information in the Contact header field,
   the same considerations as described in <a href="#section-11.3">Section 11.3</a> apply.

   When a UAC generates a request that will initiate a dialog, it SHOULD
   obtain permission from the user (either through a user interface or
   apriori configuration) before including capability information in the
   Contact header field of the request.  Confidentiality and integrity
   of the information SHOULD be provided using SIPS.  S/MIME MAY be
   used.

   This section provides a brief overview of <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> and related
   specifications that form the content negotiation framework.  This
   section does not represent normative behavior.  In the event of any
   conflict between the tutorial material here and the normative text in
   <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a>, <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> takes precedence.

   A critical concept in the framework is that of a feature set.  A
   feature set is information about an entity (in our case, a UA), which
   describes a set of features it can handle.  A feature set can be
   thought of as a region in N-dimensional space.  Each dimension in
   this space is a different media feature, identified by a media
   feature tag.  For example, one dimension (or axis) might represent
   languages, another might represent methods, and another, MIME types.
   A feature collection represents a single point in this space.  It
   represents a particular rendering or instance of an entity (in our
   case, a UA).  For example, a "rendering" of a UA would define an
   instantaneous mode of operation that it can support.  One such
   rendering would be processing the INVITE method, which carried the
   application/sdp MIME type, sent to a UA for a user that is speaking
   English.

   A feature set can therefore be defined as a set of feature
   collections.  In other words, a feature set is a region of N-
   dimensional feature-space, that region being defined by the set of
   points - feature collections - that make up the space.  If a
   particular feature collection is in the space, it means that the
   rendering described by that feature collection is supported by the
   device with that feature set.

   How does one represent a feature set?  There are many ways to
   describe an N-dimensional space.  One way is to identify mathematical
   functions which identify its contours.  Clearly, that is too complex
   to be useful.  The solution taken in <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> is to define the space
   with a feature set predicate.  A feature predicate defines a relation
   over an N-dimensional space; its input is any point in that space
   (i.e., a feature collection), and is true for all points that are in
   the region thus defined.

   <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> describes a syntax for writing down these N-dimensional
   boolean functions, borrowed from LDAP [<a href="#ref-14" title='"LDAP: String Representation of Search Filters"'>14</a>].  It uses a prolog-style
   syntax which is fairly self-explanatory.  This representation is
   called a feature set predicate.  The base unit of the predicate is a
   filter, which is a boolean expression encased in round brackets.  A
   filter can be complex, where it contains conjunctions and





<span class="grey">Rosenberg, et al.           Standards Track                    [Page 33]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3840.html">RFC 3840</a>                    SIP Capabilities                 August 2004</span>


   disjunctions of other filters, or it can be simple.  A simple filter
   is one that expresses a comparison operation on a single media
   feature tag.

   For example, consider the feature set predicate:

      (&amp; (foo=A)
         (bar=B)
         (| (baz=C) (&amp; (baz=D) (bif=E))))

   This defines a function over four media features - foo, bar, baz, and
   bif.  Any point in feature space with foo equal to A, bar equal to B,
   and baz equal to either C or D, and bif equal to E, is in the feature
   set defined by this feature set predicate.

   Note that the predicate doesn't say anything about the number of
   dimensions in feature space.  The predicate operates on a feature
   space of any number of dimensions, but only those dimensions labeled
   foo, bar, baz, and bif matter.  The result is that values of other
   media features don't matter.  The feature collection
   {foo=A,bar=B,baz=C,bop=F} is in the feature set described by the
   predicate, even though the media feature tag "bop" isn't mentioned.
   Feature set predicates are therefore inclusive by default.  A feature
   collection is present unless the boolean predicate rules it out.
   This was a conscious design choice in <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a>.

   <a href="rfc2533.html">RFC 2533</a> also talks about matching a preference with a capability
   set.  This is accomplished by representing both with a feature set.
   A preference is a feature set - its a specification of a number of
   feature collections, any one of which would satisfy the requirements
   of the sender.  A capability is also a feature set - its a
   specification of the feature collections that the recipient supports.
   There is a match when the spaces defined by both feature sets
   overlap.  When there is overlap, there exists at least one feature
   collection that exists in both feature sets, and therefore a modality
   or rendering desired by the sender which is supported by the
   recipient.

   This leads directly to the definition of a match.  Two feature sets
   match if there exists at least one feature collection present in both
   feature sets.

   Computing a match for two general feature set predicates is not easy.
   <a href="rfc2533.html#section-5">Section 5 of RFC 2533</a> presents an algorithm for doing it by expanding
   an arbitrary expression into disjunctive normal form.  However, the
   feature set predicates used by this specification are constrained.
   They are always in conjunctive normal form, with each term in the
   conjunction describing values for different media features.  This

   makes computation of a match easy.  It is computed independently for
   each media feature, and then the feature sets overlap if media
   features specified in both sets overlap.  Computing the overlap of a
   single media feature is very straightforward, and is a simple matter
   of computing whether two finite sets overlap.
