Abstract

   This document presents two improved metrics for packet reordering,
   namely, Reorder Density (RD) and Reorder Buffer-occupancy Density
   (RBD).  A threshold is used to clearly define when a packet is
   considered lost, to bound computational complexity at O(N), and to
   keep the memory requirement for evaluation independent of N, where N
   is the length of the packet sequence.  RD is a comprehensive metric
   that captures the characteristics of reordering, while RBD evaluates
   the sequences from the point of view of recovery from reordering.

   Packet reordering is a phenomenon that occurs in Internet Protocol
   (IP) networks.  Major causes of packet reordering include, but are
   not limited to, packet striping at layers 2 and 3 [<a href="#ref-Ben99" title='"Packet Reordering is Not Pathological Network Behavior,"'>Ben99</a>] [<a href="#ref-Jai03" title='"Measurement and Classification of Out-of- sequence Packets in Tier-1 IP Backbone,"'>Jai03</a>],
   priority scheduling (e.g., Diffserv), and route fluttering [<a href="#ref-Pax97" title='"Measurements and Analysis of End-to-End Internet Dynamics,"'>Pax97</a>]
   [<a href="#ref-Boh03" title='"TCP-PR: TCP for Persistent Packet Reordering,"'>Boh03</a>].  Reordering leads to degradation of the performance of many
   applications [<a href="#ref-Ben99" title='"Packet Reordering is Not Pathological Network Behavior,"'>Ben99</a>] [<a href="#ref-Bla02" title='"On Making TCP More Robust to Packet Reordering,"'>Bla02</a>] [<a href="#ref-Lao02" title='"The Effect of Packet Reordering in a Backbone Link on Application Throughput,"'>Lao02</a>].  Increased link speeds [<a href="#ref-Bar04" title='"Measurement and Analysis of Packet Reordering Using Reorder Density,"'>Bar04</a>],
   increased parallelism within routers and switches, Quality-of-Service
   (QoS) support, and load balancing among links all point to increased
   packet reordering in future networks.

   Effective metrics for reordering are required to measure and quantify
   reordering.  A good metric or a set of metrics capturing the nature
   of reordering can be expected to provide insight into the reordering
   phenomenon in networks.  It may be possible to use such metrics to
   predict the effects of reordering on applications that are sensitive
   to packet reordering, and perhaps even to compensate for reordering.
   A metric for reordered packets may also help evaluate network
   protocols and implementations with respect to their impact on packet
   reordering.

   The percentage of out-of-order packets is often used as a metric for
   characterizing reordering.  However, this metric is vague and lacking
   in detail.  Further, there is no uniform definition for the degree of
   reordering of an arrived packet [<a href="#ref-Ban02" title='"Metrics for Degree of Reordering in Packet Sequences"'>Ban02</a>] [<a href="#ref-Pi05a" title='"A Theoretical Foundation, Metrics and Modeling of Packet Reordering and Methodology of Delay Modeling using Inter-packet Gaps,"'>Pi05a</a>].  For example,
   consider the two packet sequences (1, 3, 4, 2, 5) and (1, 4, 3, 2,
   5).  It is possible to interpret the reordering of packets in these
   sequences differently.  For example,

   (i)   Packets 2, 3, and 4 are out of order in both cases.

   (ii)  Only packet 2 is out of order in the first sequence, while
         packets 2 and 3 are out of order in the second.

   (iii) Packets 3 and 4 are out of order in both the sequences.

   (iv)  Packets 2, 3, and 4 are out of order in the first sequence,
         while packets 4 and 2 are out of order in the second sequence.

   In essence, the percentage of out-of-order packets as a metric of
   reordering is subject to interpretation and cannot capture the
   reordering unambiguously and hence, accurately.

   Other metrics attempt to overcome this ambiguity by defining only the
   late packets or only the early packets as being reordered.  However,
   measuring reordering based only on late or only on early packets is
   not always effective.  Consider, for example, the sequence (1, 20, 2,



<span class="grey">Jayasumana, et al.           Informational                      [Page 3]</span></pre>

   3, ..., 19, 21, 22, ...); the only anomaly is that packet 20 is
   delivered immediately after packet 1.  A metric based only on
   lateness will indicate a high degree of reordering, even though in
   this example it is a single packet arriving ahead of others.
   Similarly, a metric based only on earliness does not accurately
   capture reordering caused by a late arriving packet.  A complete
   reorder metric must account for both earliness and lateness, and it
   must be able to differentiate between the two.  The inability to
   capture both the earliness and the lateness precludes a metric from
   being useful for estimating end-to-end reordering based on reordering
   in constituent subnets.

   The sensitivity to packet reordering can vary significantly from one
   application to the other.  Consider again the packet sequence (1, 3,
   4, 2, 5).  If buffers are available to store packets 3 and 4 while
   waiting for packet 2, an application can recover from reordering.
   However, with certain real-time applications, the out-of-order
   arrival of packet 2 may render it useless.  While one can argue that
   a good packet reordering measurement scheme should capture
   application-specific effects, a counter argument can also be made
   that packet reordering should be measured strictly with respect to
   the order of delivery, independent of the application.

   Many different packet reordering metrics have been suggested.  For
   example, the standards-track document <a href="rfc4737.html">RFC 4737</a> [<a href="rfc4737.html" title='"Packet Reordering Metrics"'>RFC4737</a>] defines 11
   metrics for packet reordering, including lateness-based percentage
   metrics, reordering extent metrics, and N-reordering.

   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document discusses the desirable attributes of any
   packet reordering metric.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> introduces two additional packet
   reorder metrics: Reorder Density (RD) and Reorder Buffer-occupancy
   Density (RBD), which we claim are superior to the others [<a href="#ref-Pi07" title='"Metrics for Packet Reordering - A Comparative Analysis,"'>Pi07</a>].  In
   particular, RD possesses all the desirable attributes, while other
   metrics fall significantly short in several of these attributes.  RBD
   is unique in measuring reordering in terms of the system resources
   needed for recovery from packet reordering.  Both RD and RBD have a
   computation complexity O(N), where N is the length of the packet
   sequence, and they can therefore be used for real-time online
   monitoring.

   The first and foremost requirement of a packet reordering metric is
   its ability to capture the amount and extent of reordering in a
   sequence of packets.  The fact that a measure varies with reordering
   of packets in a stream does not make it a good metric.  In [<a href="#ref-Ben99" title='"Packet Reordering is Not Pathological Network Behavior,"'>Ben99</a>],
   the authors have identified desirable features of a reordering
   metric.  This list encloses the foremost requirements stated above:

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5236.html">RFC 5236</a>           Improved Packet Reordering Metrics          June 2008</span>


   simplicity, low sensitivity to packet loss, ability to combine
   reorder measures from two networks, minimal value for in-order data,
   and independence of data size.  These features are explained below in
   detail, along with additional desired features.  Note, the ability to
   combine reorder measures from two networks is added to broaden
   applicability, and data size independence is discussed under
   evaluation complexity.  However, data size independence could also
   refer to the final measure, as in percentage reordering or even a
   normalized representation.

   a) Simplicity

      An ideal metric is one that is simple to understand and evaluate,
      and yet informative, i.e., able to provide a complete picture of
      reordering.  Percentage of packets reordered is the simplest
      singleton metric; but the ambiguity in its definition, as
      discussed earlier, and its failure to carry the extent of
      reordering make it less informative.  On the other hand, keeping
      track of the displacements of each and every packet without
      compressing the data will contain all the information about
      reordering, but it is not simple to evaluate or use.

      A simpler metric may be preferred in some cases even though it
      does not capture reordering completely, while other cases may
      demand a more complex, yet complete metric.

      In striving to strike a balance, the lateness-based metrics
      consider only the late packets as reordered, and earliness-based
      metrics only the early packets as reordered.  However, a metric
      based only on earliness or only on lateness captures only a part
      of the information associated with reordering.  In contrast, a
      metric capturing both early and late arrivals provides a complete
      picture of reordering in a sequence.

   b) Low Sensitivity to Packet Loss and Duplication

      A reorder metric should treat only an out-of-order packet as
      reordered, i.e., if a packet is lost during transit, then this
      should not result in its following packets, which arrive in order,
      being classified as out of order.  Consider the sequence (1, 3, 4,
      5, 6).  If packet 2 has been lost, the sequence should not be
      considered to contain any out-of-order packets.  Similarly, if
      multiple copies of a packet (duplicates) are delivered, this must








<span class="grey">Jayasumana, et al.           Informational                      [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-6" id="page-6" name="page-6"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5236.html">RFC 5236</a>           Improved Packet Reordering Metrics          June 2008</span>


      not result in a packet being classified as out of order, as long
      as one copy arrives in the proper position.  For example, sequence
      (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5) has no reordering.  The lost and duplicate
      packet counts may be tracked using metrics specifically intended
      to measure those, e.g., percentage of lost packets, and percentage
      of duplicate packets.

   c) Low Evaluation Complexity

      Memory and time complexities associated with evaluating a metric
      play a vital role in implementation and real-time measurements.
      Spatial/memory complexity corresponds to the amount of buffers
      required for the overall measurement process, whereas
      time/computation complexity refers to the number of computation
      steps involved in computing the amount of reordering in a
      sequence.  On-the-fly evaluation of the metric for large streams
      of packets requires the computational complexity to be O(N), where
      N denotes the number of received packets, used for the reordering
      measure.  This allows the metric to be updated in constant-time as
      each packet arrives.  In the absence of a threshold defining
      losses or the number of sequence numbers to buffer for detection
      of duplicates, the worst-case complexity of loss and duplication
      detection will increase with N.  The rate of increase will depend,
      among other things, on the value of N and the implementation of
      the duplicate detection scheme.

   d) Robustness

      Reorder measurements should be robust against different network
      phenomena and peculiarities in measurement or sequences such as a
      very late arrival of a duplicate packet, or even a rogue packet
      due to an error or sequence number wraparound.  The impact due to
      an event associated with a single or a small number of packets
      should have a sense of proportionality on the reorder measure.
      Consider, for example, the arrival sequence: (1, 5430, 2, 3, 4, 5,
      ...) where packet 5430 appears to be very early; it may be due to
      either sequence rollover in test streams or some unknown reason.

   e) Broad Applicability

      A framework for IP performance metrics [<a href="rfc2330.html" title='"Framework for IP Performance Metrics"'>RFC2330</a>] states: "The
      metrics must aid users and providers in understanding the
      performance they experience or provide".

      Rather than being a mere value or a set of values that changes
      with the reordering of packets in a stream, a reorder metric
      should be useful for a variety of purposes.  An application or a
      transport protocol implementation, for example, may be able to use



<span class="grey">Jayasumana, et al.           Informational                      [Page 6]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-7" id="page-7" name="page-7"> </a>

      the reordering information to allocate resources to recover from
      reordering.  A metric may be useful for TCP flow control, buffer
      resource allocation for recovery from reordering and/or network
      diagnosis.

      The ability to combine the reorder metrics of constituent subnets
      to measure the end-to-end reordering would be an extremely useful
      property.  In the absence of this property, no amount of
      individual network measurements, short of measuring the reordering
      for the pair of endpoints of interest, would be useful in
      predicting the end-to-end reordering.

      The ability to provide different types of information based on
      monitoring or diagnostic needs also broadens the applicability of
      a metric.  Examples of applicable information for reordering may
      include parameters such as the percentage of reordered packets
      that resulted in fast retransmissions in TCP, or the percentage of
      utilization of the reorder recovery buffer.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Reorder%20Density%20and%20Reorder%20Buffer-Occupancy%20Density"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Reorder Density and Reorder Buffer-Occupancy Density</span>

   In this memo, we define two discrete density functions, Reorder
   Density (RD) and Reorder Buffer-occupancy Density (RBD), that capture
   the nature of reordering in a packet stream.  These two metrics can
   be used individually or collectively to characterize the reordering
   in a packet stream.  Also presented are algorithms for real-time
   evaluation of these metrics for an incoming packet stream.

   RD is defined as the distribution of displacements of packets from
   their original positions, normalized with respect to the number of
   packets.  An early packet corresponds to a negative displacement and
   a late packet to a positive displacement.  A threshold on
   displacement is used to keep the computation within bounds.  The
   choice of threshold value depends on the measurement uses and
   constraints, such as whether duplicate packets are accounted for when
   evaluating these displacements (discussed in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>).

   The ability of RD to capture the nature and properties of reordering
   in a comprehensive manner has been demonstrated in [<a href="#ref-Pi05a" title='"A Theoretical Foundation, Metrics and Modeling of Packet Reordering and Methodology of Delay Modeling using Inter-packet Gaps,"'>Pi05a</a>], [<a href="#ref-Pi05b" title='"RD: A Formal, Comprehensive Metric for Packet Reordering,"'>Pi05b</a>],
   [<a href="#ref-Pi05c" title='"On Reorder Density and its Application to Characterization of Packet Reordering,"'>Pi05c</a>], and [<a href="#ref-Pi07" title='"Metrics for Packet Reordering - A Comparative Analysis,"'>Pi07</a>].  The RD observed at the output port of a subnet
   when the input is an in-order packet stream can be viewed as a
   "reorder response" of a network, a concept somewhat similar to the
   "system response" or "impulse response" used in traditional system
   theory.  For a subnet under stationary conditions, RD is the
   probability density of the packet displacement.  RD measured on
   individual subnets can be combined, using the convolution operation,
   to predict the end-to-end reorder characteristics of the network
   formed by the cascade of subnets under a fairly broad set of



<span class="grey">Jayasumana, et al.           Informational                      [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-8" id="page-8" name="page-8"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5236.html">RFC 5236</a>           Improved Packet Reordering Metrics          June 2008</span>


   conditions [<a href="#ref-Pi05b" title='"RD: A Formal, Comprehensive Metric for Packet Reordering,"'>Pi05b</a>].  RD also shows significant promise as a tool for
   analytical modeling of reordering, as demonstrated with a load-
   balancing scenario in [<a href="#ref-Pi06" title='"Reordering of Packets due to Multipath Forwarding - An Analysis,"'>Pi06</a>].  Use of a threshold to define the
   condition under which a packet is considered lost makes the metric
   robust, efficient, and adaptable for different network and stream
   characteristics.

   RBD is the normalized histogram of the occupancy of a hypothetical
   buffer that would allow the recovery from out-of-order delivery of
   packets.  If an arriving packet is early, it is added to a
   hypothetical buffer until it can be released in order [<a href="#ref-Ban02" title='"Metrics for Degree of Reordering in Packet Sequences"'>Ban02</a>].  The
   occupancy of this buffer, after each arrival, is used as the measure
   of reordering.  A threshold, used to declare a packet as lost, keeps
   the complexity of computation within bounds.  The threshold may be
   selected based on application requirements in situations where the
   late arrival of a packet makes it useless, e.g., a real-time
   application.  In [<a href="#ref-Ban02" title='"Metrics for Degree of Reordering in Packet Sequences"'>Ban02</a>], this metric was called RD and buffer
   occupancy was known as displacement.

   RD and RBD are simple, yet useful, metrics for measurement and
   evaluation of reordering.  These metrics are robust against many
   peculiarities, such as those discussed previously, and have a
   computational complexity of O(N), where N is the received sequence
   size.  RD is orthogonal to loss and duplication, whereas RBD is
   orthogonal to duplication.

   A detailed comparison of these and other proposed metrics for
   reordering is presented in [<a href="#ref-Pi07" title='"Metrics for Packet Reordering - A Comparative Analysis,"'>Pi07</a>].

   The following terms are used to formally define RD, RBD, and the
   measurement algorithms.  The wraparound of sequence numbers is not
   addressed in this document explicitly, but with the use of modulo-N
   arithmetic, all claims made here remain valid in the presence of
   wraparound.

   Consider a sequence of packets (1, 2, ..., N) transmitted over a
   network.  A receive index RI (1, 2, ...), is a value assigned to a
   packet as it arrives at its destination, according to the order of
   arrival.  A receive index is not assigned to duplicate packets, and
   the receive index value skips the value corresponding to a lost
   packet.  (The detection of loss and duplication for this purpose is
   described in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.)  In the absence of reordering, the sequence
   number of the packet and the receive index are the same for each
   packet.

   RI is used to compute earliness and lateness of an arriving packet.
   Below are two examples of received sequences with receive index
   values for a sequence of 5 packets (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) arriving out of
   order:

   Example 1:
   Arrived sequence:    2   1   4   5    3
   receive index:       1   2   3   4    5

   Example 2:
   Arrived sequence:    1   4   3   5    3
   receive index:       1   3   4   5    -

   In Example 1, there is no loss or duplication.  In Example 2, the
   packet with sequence number 2 is lost.  Thus, 2 is not assigned as an
   RI.  Packet 3 is duplicated; thus, the second copy is not assigned an
   RI.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Out-of-Order%20Packet"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Out-of-Order Packet</span>

   When the sequence number of a packet is not equal to the RI assigned
   to it, it is considered to be an out-of-order packet.  Duplicates for
   which an RI is not defined are ignored.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20Displacement%20%28D%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Displacement (D)</span>

   Displacement (D) of a packet is defined as the difference between RI
   and the sequence number of the packet, i.e., the displacement of
   packet i is RI[i] - i.  Thus, a negative displacement indicates the
   earliness of a packet and a positive displacement the lateness.  In
   example 3 below, an arrived sequence with displacements of each
   packet is illustrated.

   Example 3:
   Arrived sequence:    1   4   3   5   3   8   7   6
   receive index:       1   3   4   5   -   6   7   8
   Displacement:        0  -1   1   0   -  -2   0   2

   The displacement threshold is a threshold on the displacement of
   packets that allows the metric to classify a packet as lost or
   duplicate.  Determining when to classify a packet as lost is
   difficult because there is no point in time at which a packet can
   definitely be classified as lost; the packet may still arrive after
   some arbitrarily long delay.  However, from a practical point of
   view, a packet may be classified as lost if it has not arrived within
   a certain administratively defined displacement threshold, DT.



<span class="grey">Jayasumana, et al.           Informational                      [Page 9]</span></pre>

   Similarly, to identify a duplicate packet, it is theoretically
   necessary to keep track of all the arrived (or missing) packets.
   Again, however, from a practical point of view, missing packets
   within a certain window of sequence numbers suffice.  Thus, DT is
   used as a practical means for declaring a packet as lost or
   duplicated.  DT makes the metric more robust, keeps the computational
   complexity for long sequences within O(N), and keeps storage
   requirements independent of N.

   If the DT selected is too small, reordered packets might be
   classified as lost.  A large DT will increase both the size of memory
   required to keep track of sequence numbers and the length of
   computation time required to evaluate the metric.  Indeed, it is
   possible to use two different thresholds for the two cases.  The
   selection of DT is further discussed in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

   Displacement Frequency FD[k] is the number of arrived packets having
   a displacement of k, where k takes values from -DT to DT.

   RD is defined as the distribution of the Displacement Frequencies
   FD[k], normalized with respect to N', where N' is the length of the
   received sequence, ignoring lost and duplicate packets.  N' is equal
   to the sum(FD[k]) for k in [-DT, DT].

   A packet with sequence number E is expected if E is the largest
   number such that all the packets with sequence numbers less than E
   have already arrived or have been determined to be lost.

   An arrived packet with a sequence number greater than that of an
   expected packet is considered to be stored in a hypothetical buffer
   sufficiently long to permit recovery from reordering.  At any packet
   arrival instant, the buffer occupancy is equal to the number of
   out-of-order packets in the buffer, including the newly arrived
   packet.  One buffer location is assumed for each packet, although it
   is possible to extend the concept to the case where the number of
   bytes is used for buffer occupancy.  For example, consider the

   sequence of packets (1, 2, 4, 5, 3) with expected order (1, 2, 3, 4,
   5).  When packet 4 arrives, the buffer occupancy is 1 because packet
   4 arrived early.  Similarly, the buffer occupancy becomes 2 when
   packet 5 arrives.  When packet 3 arrives, recovery from reordering
   occurs and the buffer occupancy reduces to zero.

   Buffer-occupancy threshold is a threshold on the maximum size of the
   hypothetical buffer that is used for recovery from reordering.  As
   with the case of DT for RD, BT is used for loss and duplication
   classification for Reorder Buffer-occupancy Density (RBD) computation
   (see <a href="#section-3.11">Section 3.11</a>).  BT provides robustness and limits the
   computational complexity of RBD.

   At the arrival of each packet, the buffer occupancy may take any

   Reorder buffer-occupancy density is the buffer occupancy frequencies
   normalized by the total number of non-duplicate packets, i.e.,
   RBD[k] = FB[k]/N' where N' is the length of the received sequence,
   ignoring excessively delayed (deemed lost) and duplicate packets.  N'
   is also the sum(FB[k]) for all k such that k belongs to [0, BT].

   Consider a sequence of packets (1, 2, ..., N).  Let the RI assigned
   to packet m be "the sequence number m plus an offset dm", i.e.,

            RI = m + dm; D  = dm

   A reorder event of packet m is represented by r(m, dm).  When dm is
   not equal to zero, a reorder event is said to have occurred.  A
   packet is late if dm &gt; 0 and early if dm &lt; 0.  Thus, packet
   reordering of a sequence of packets is completely represented by the
   union of reorder events, R, referred to as the reorder set:

            R = {r(m,dm)| dm not equal to 0 for all m}

   If there is no reordering in a packet sequence, then R is the null
   set.

   Examples 4 and 5 illustrate the reorder set:

   Example 4. No losses or duplicates

   Arrived Sequence     1       2       3       5       4       6
   receive index (RI)   1       2       3       4       5       6
   Displacement (D)     0       0       0      -1       1       0
   R = {(4,1), (5,-1)}

   Example 5. Packet 4 is lost and 2 is duplicated

   Arrived Sequence     1       2       5       3       6       2
   receive index (RI)   1       2       3       5       6       -
   Displacement (D)     0       0       -2      2       0       -
   R = {(3, 2), (5, -2)}

   RD is defined as the discrete density of the frequency of packets
   with respect to their displacements, i.e., the lateness and earliness
   from the original position.  Let S[k] denote the set of reorder
   events in R with displacement equal to k.  That is:

            S[k]= {r(m, dm)| dm = k}

   Let |S[k]| be the cardinality of set S[k].  Thus, RD[k] is defined as
   |S[k]| normalized with respect to the total number of received
   packets (N').  Note that N' does not include duplicate or lost
   packets.

            RD[k]  = |S[k]| / N' for k not equal to zero

   RD[0] corresponds to the packets for which RI is the same as the
   sequence number:

            RD[0] = 1 - sum(|S[k]| / N')

   As defined previously, FD[k] is the measure that keeps track of
   |S[k]|.

   Although assigning a threshold for determining lost and duplicate
   packets might appear to introduce error into the reorder metrics, in
   practice this need not be the case.  Applications, protocols, and the
   network itself operate within finite resource constraints that
   introduce practical limits beyond which the choice of certain values
   becomes irrelevant.  If the operational nature of an application is
   such that a DT can be defined, then using DT in the computation of
   reorder metrics will not invalidate nor limit the effectiveness of

   the metrics, i.e., increasing DT does not provide any benefit.  In
   the case of TCP, the maximum transmit and receive window sizes impose
   a natural limit on the useful value of DT.  Sequence number
   wraparound may provide a useful upper bound for DT in some instances.

   If there are no operational constraints imposed by factors as
   described above, or if one is purely interested in a more complete
   picture of reordering, then DT can be made as large as required.  If
   DT is equal to the length of the packet sequence (worst case
   scenario), a complete picture of reordering is seen.  Any metric that
   does not rely on a threshold to declare a packet as lost implicitly
   makes one of two assumptions: a) A missing packet is not considered
   lost until the end of the sequence, or b) the packet is considered
   lost until it arrives.  The former corresponds to the case where DT
   is set to the length of the sequence.  The latter leads to many
   problems related to complexity and robustness.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Detection%20of%20Lost%20and%20Duplicate%20Packets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Detection of Lost and Duplicate Packets</span>

   In RD, a packet is considered lost if it is late beyond DT.
   Non-duplicate arriving packets do not have a copy in the buffer and
   do not have a sequence number less (earlier) than E.  In RBD, a
   packet is considered lost if the buffer is filled to its threshold
   BT.  A packet is considered a duplicate when the sequence number is
   less than the expected packet, or if the sequence number is already
   in the buffer.

   Since RI skips the sequence number of a lost packet, the question
   arises as to how to assign an RI to subsequent packets that arrive
   before it is known that the packet is lost.  This problem arises only
   when reorder metrics are calculated in real-time for an incoming
   sequence, and not with offline computations.  This concern can be
   handled in one of two ways:

   a) Go-back Method:  RD is computed as packets arrive.  When a packet
   is deemed lost, RI values are corrected and displacements are
   recomputed.  The Go-back Method is only invoked when a packet is lost
   and recomputing RD involves at most DT packets.

   b) Stay-back Method:  RD evaluation lags the arriving packets so that
   the correct RI and E values can be assigned to each packet as it
   arrives.  Here, RI is assigned to a packet only once, and the value
   assigned is guaranteed to be correct.  In the worst case, the
   computation lags the arriving packet by DT.  The lag associated with
   the Stay-back Method is incurred only when a packet is missing.

   Another issue related to a metric and its implementation is the
   robustness against peculiarities that may occur in a sequence as
   discussed in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>.  Consider, for example, the arrival sequence
   (1, 5430, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...).  With RD, a sense of proportionality is
   easily maintained using the concept of threshold (DT), which limits
   the effects a rogue packet can have on the measurement results.  In
   this example, when the displacement is greater than DT, rogue packet
   5430 is discarded.  In this way the impact due to the rogue packet is
   limited, at most, to DT packets, thus imposing a limit on the amount
   of error it can cause in the results.  Note also that a threshold
   different from DT can be used for the same purpose.  For example, a
   pre-specified threshold that limits the time a packet remains in the
   buffer can make RBD robust against rogue packets.

   The algorithms to compute RD and RBD are given below.  These
   algorithms are applicable for online computation of an incoming
   packet stream and provide an up-to-date metric for the packet stream
   read so far.  For simplicity, the sequence numbers are considered to
   start from 1 and continue in increments of 1.  Only the Stay-back
   Method of loss detection is presented here; hence, the RD values lag
   by a maximum of DT.  The algorithm for the Go-back Method is given in
   [<a href="#ref-Bar04" title='"Measurement and Analysis of Packet Reordering Using Reorder Density,"'>Bar04</a>].  Perl scripts for these algorithms are posted in [<a href="#ref-Per04" title=" http://www.cnrl.colostate.edu/packet_reorder.html">Per04</a>].

   Additional information may be extracted from RD and RBD depending on
   the specific applications.  For example, in the case of resource
   allocation at a node to recover from reordering, the mean and
   variance of buffer occupancy can be derived from RBD.  For example:

   Mean occupancy of recovery buffer =  sum(i*RBD[i] for 0 &lt;= i &lt;= BT)

   The basic definition of RBD may be modified to count the buffer
   occupancy in bytes as opposed to packets when the actual buffer space
   is more important.  Another alternative is to use time to update the
   buffer occupancy compared to updating it at every arrival instant.

   The parameters that can be extracted from RD include the percentage
   of late (or early) packets, mean displacement of packets, and mean
   displacement of late (or early) packets [<a href="#ref-Ye06" title='"On Monitoring of End-to-End Packet Reordering over the Internet,"'>Ye06</a>].  For example, the
   fraction of packets that arrive after three or more of their
   successors according to the order of transmission is given by Sum

   [RD[i] for 3&lt;=i&lt;=DT].  RD also allows for extraction of parameters
   such as entropy of the reordered sequence, a measure of disorder in
   the sequence [<a href="#ref-Ye06" title='"On Monitoring of End-to-End Packet Reordering over the Internet,"'>Ye06</a>].  Due to the probability mass function nature of
   RD, it is also a convenient measure for theoretical modeling and
