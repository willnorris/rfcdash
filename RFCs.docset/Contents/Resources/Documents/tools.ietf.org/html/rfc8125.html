   Passwords are the predominant method of accessing the Internet today
   due, in large part, to their intuitiveness and ease of use.  Since a
   user needs to enter passwords repeatedly in many connections and
   applications, these passwords tend to be easy to remember and can be
   entered repeatedly with a low probability of error.  They tend to be
   low-grade and not-so-random secrets that are susceptible to brute-
   force guessing attacks.

   A Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) attempts to address this
   issue by constructing a cryptographic key exchange that does not
   result in the password, or password-derived data, being transmitted
   across an unsecured channel.  Two parties in the exchange prove
   possession of the shared password without revealing it.  Such
   exchanges are therefore resistant to offline, brute-force dictionary
   attacks.  The idea was initially described by Bellovin and Merritt in
   [<a href="#ref-BM92" title='"Encrypted Key Exchange: Password-Based Protocols Secure against Dictionary Attacks"'>BM92</a>] and has received considerable cryptographic attention since
   then.  PAKEs are especially interesting due to the fact that they can
   achieve mutual authentication without requiring any Public Key
   Infrastructure (PKI).

   Different types of PAKE schemes are reviewed in this document.  It
   defines requirements for new schemes and gives additional
   recommendations for designers of PAKE schemes.  The specific
   recommendations are discussed throughout Sections <a href="#section-3">3</a>-<a href="#section-7">7</a>.  <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>
   summarizes the requirements.

   The requirements mentioned in this document have been discussed with
   active members and represent the consensus of the Crypto Forum
   Research Group (CFRG).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Requirements%20Notation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Requirements Notation</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20PAKE%20Taxonomy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  PAKE Taxonomy</span>

   Broadly speaking, different PAKEs satisfy their goals in a number of
   common ways.  This leads to various design choices: how public keys
   are transmitted (encrypted or not), whether both parties possess the
   same representation of the password (balanced versus augmented), and
   the number of parties (two party versus multiparty).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20Storage%20of%20the%20Password"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  Storage of the Password</span>

   When both sides of a PAKE store the same representation of the
   password, the PAKE is said to be "balanced".  In a balanced PAKE, the
   password can be stored directly in a salted state by hashing it with
   a random salt or by representing the credential as an element in a
   finite field (by, for instance, multiplying a generator from a finite
   field and the password represented as a number to produce a "password
   element").  The benefits of such PAKEs are that they are applicable
   to situations where either party can initiate the exchange or both
   parties can initiate simultaneously, i.e., where they both believe
   themselves to be the "initiator".  This sort of PAKE can be useful
   for mesh networking (see, for example, [<a href="#ref-DOT11" title='"IEEE Standard for Information technology-- Telecommunications and information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks--Specific requirements - Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications"'>DOT11</a>]) or Internet of Things
   applications.

   When one side maintains a transform of the password and the other
   maintains the raw password, the PAKE is said to be "augmented".
   Typically, a client will maintain the raw password (or some
   representation of it as in the balanced case), and a server will
   maintain a transformed element generated with a one-way function.
   The benefit of an augmented PAKE is that it provides some protection
   for the server's password in a way that is not possible with a
   balanced PAKE.  In particular, an adversary that has successfully
   obtained the server's PAKE credentials cannot directly use them to

   impersonate the users to other servers.  The adversary has to learn
   the individual passwords first, e.g., by performing an (offline)
   dictionary attack.  This sort of PAKE is useful for strict client-
   server protocols such as the one discussed in [<a href="rfc5246.html" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>RFC5246</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20Transmission%20of%20Public%20Keys"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  Transmission of Public Keys</span>

   All known PAKEs use public key cryptography.  A fundamental
   difference in PAKEs is how the public key is communicated in the
   exchange.

   One class of PAKEs uses symmetric key cryptography, with a key
   derived from the password, to encrypt an ephemeral public key.  The
   ability of the peer to demonstrate that it has successfully decrypted
   the public key proves knowledge of the shared password.  Examples of
   this exchange include the first PAKE, called the "Encrypted Key
   Exchange (EKE)", which was introduced in [<a href="#ref-BM92" title='"Encrypted Key Exchange: Password-Based Protocols Secure against Dictionary Attacks"'>BM92</a>].

   Another class of PAKEs transmits unencrypted public keys, like the
   J-PAKE (Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling) protocol
   [<a href="#ref-JPAKE" title='"Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling"'>JPAKE</a>].  During key agreement, ephemeral public keys and values
   derived using the shared password are exchanged.  If the passwords
   match, both parties can compute a common secret by combining
   password, public keys, and private keys.  The SPEKE (Strong Password-
   Only Authenticated Key Exchange) [<a href="#ref-SPEKE" title='"Strong Password-Only Authenticated Key Exchange"'>SPEKE</a>] scheme also exchanges public
   keys, namely Diffie-Hellman values.  Here, the generator for the
   public keys is derived from the shared secret.  Afterwards, only the
   public Diffie-Hellman values are exchanged; the generator is kept
   secret.  In both cases, the values that are transmitted across the
   unsecured medium are elements in a finite field and not a random
   blob.

   A combination of EKE and SPEKE is used in PACE as described in
   [<a href="#ref-BFK09" title='"Security Analysis of the PACE Key-Agreement Protocol"'>BFK09</a>], which is, e.g., used in international travel documents.  In
   this method, a nonce is encrypted rather than a key.  This nonce is
   used to generate a common base for the key agreement.  Without
   knowing the password, the nonce cannot be determined; hence, the
   subsequent key agreement will fail.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20Two%20Party%20versus%20Multiparty"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Two Party versus Multiparty</span>

   The majority of PAKE protocols allow two parties to agree on a shared
   key based on a shared password.  Nevertheless, there exist proposals
   that allow key agreement for more than two parties.  Those protocols
   allow key establishment for a group of parties and are hence called
   "Group PAKEs" or "GPAKEs".  Examples of such protocols can be found
   in [<a href="#ref-ABCP06" title='"Password-Based Group Key Exchange in a Constant Number of Rounds"'>ABCP06</a>], while [<a href="#ref-ACGP11" title='"Contributory Password-Authenticated Group Key Exchange with Join Capability"'>ACGP11</a>] and [<a href="#ref-HYCS15" title='"The Fairy-Ring Dance: Password Authenticated Key Exchange in a Group"'>HYCS15</a>] propose a generic
   construction that allows the transformation of any two-party PAKE

   into a GPAKE protocol.  Another possibility of defining a multiparty
   PAKE protocol is to assume the existence of a trusted server with
   which each party shares a password.  This server enables different
   parties to agree on a common secret key without the need to share a
   password among themselves.  Each party has only a shared secret with
   the trusted server.  For example, Abdalla et al. designed such a
   protocol as discussed in [<a href="#ref-AFP05" title='"Password- Based Authenticated Key Exchange in the Three-Party Setting"'>AFP05</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Security%20of%20PAKEs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Security of PAKEs</span>

   PAKE schemes are modeled on the scenario of two parties, typically
   Alice and Bob, who share a password (or perhaps Bob shares a function
   of the password) and would like to use it to establish a secure
   session key over an untrusted link.  There is a powerful adversary,
   typically Eve, who would like to subvert the exchange.  Eve has
   access to a dictionary that is likely to contain Alice and Bob's
   password, and Eve is capable of enumerating through the dictionary in
   a brute-force manner to try and discover Alice and Bob's password.

   All PAKEs have a limitation.  If Eve guesses the password, she can
   subvert the exchange.  It is therefore necessary to model the
   likelihood that Eve will guess the password to access the security of
   a PAKE.  If the probability of her discovering the password is a
   function of interaction with the protocol participants and not a
   function of computation, then the PAKE is secure (that is, Eve is
   unable to take information from a passive attack or from a single
   active attack).  Thus, she cannot enumerate through her dictionary
   without interacting with Alice or Bob for each password guess, i.e.,
   the only attack left is repeated guessing.  Eve learns one thing from
   a single active attack: whether her single guess is correct or not.

   In other words, the security of a PAKE scheme is based on the idea
   that Eve, who is trying to impersonate Alice, cannot efficiently
   verify a password guess without interacting with Bob (or Alice).  If
   she were to interact with either, she would thereby be detected.
   Thus, it is important to balance restricting the number of allowed
   authentication attempts with the potential of a denial-of-service
   vulnerability.  In order to judge and compare the security of PAKE
   schemes, security proofs in commonly accepted models SHOULD be used.
   Each proof and model, however, is based on assumptions.  Often,
   security proofs show that if an adversary is able to break the
   scheme, the adversary is also able to solve a problem that is assumed
   to be hard, such as computing a discrete logarithm.  By conversion,
   breaking the scheme is considered to be a hard problem as well.

   A PAKE scheme SHOULD be accompanied with a security proof with
   clearly stated assumptions and models used.  In particular, the proof
   MUST show that the probability is negligible that an active adversary

   would be able to pass authentication, learn additional information
   about the password, or learn anything about the established key.
   Moreover, the authors MAY specify which underlying primitives are to
   be used with the scheme or MAY consider specific use cases or
   assumptions like resistance to quantum computers.  A clear and
   comprehensive proof is the foundation for users to trust in the
   security of the scheme.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Implementation%20Aspects"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Implementation Aspects</span>

   Aside from the theoretical security of a scheme, practical
   implementation pitfalls have to be considered as well.  If not
   carefully implemented, even a scheme that is secure in a well-defined
   mathematical model can leak information via side channels.  The
   design of the scheme might allow or prevent easy protection against
   information leakage.  In a network scenario, an adversary can measure
   the time that the computation of an answer takes and derive
   information about secret parameters of the scheme.  If a device
   operates in a potentially hostile environment, such as a smart card,
   other side channels like power consumption and electromagnetic
   emanations or even active implementation attacks have to be taken
   into account as well.

   The developers of a scheme SHOULD keep the implementation aspects in
   mind and show how to implement the protocol in constant time.
   Furthermore, adding a discussion about how to protect implementations
   of the scheme in potential hostile environments is encouraged.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Special%20Case%3A%20Elliptic%20Curves"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Special Case: Elliptic Curves</span>

   Since Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) allows for a smaller key
   length compared to traditional schemes based on the discrete
   logarithm problem in finite fields at similar security levels, using
   ECC for PAKE schemes is also of interest.  In contrast to schemes
   that can use the finite field element directly, an additional
   challenge has to be considered for some schemes based on ECC, namely
   the mapping of a random string to an element that can be computed
   with, i.e., a point on the curve.  In some cases, the opposite is
   also needed, i.e., the mapping of a curve point to a string that is
   not distinguishable from a random one.  When choosing a mapping, it
   is crucial to consider the implementation aspects as well.

   If the PAKE scheme is intended to be used with ECC, the authors
   SHOULD state whether there is a mapping function needed and, if so,
   discuss its requirements.  Alternatively, the authors MAY define a
   mapping to be used with the scheme.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Protocol%20Considerations%20and%20Applications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Protocol Considerations and Applications</span>

   In most cases, the PAKE scheme is a building block in a more complex
   protocol like IPsec or Transport Layer Security (TLS).  This can
   influence the choice of a suitable PAKE scheme.  For example, an
   augmented scheme can be beneficial for protocols that have a strict
   server-client relationship.  If both parties can initiate a
   connection of a protocol, a balanced PAKE might be more appropriate.

   A special variation of the network password problem, called
   "Password-Authenticated Key Distribution", is defined in [<a href="#ref-P1363" title='"Draft Standard Specifications for Password-Based Public Key Cryptographic Techniques"'>P1363</a>] as
   password-authenticated key retrieval: "The retrieval of a key from a
   secure key repository or escrow requiring authentication derived in
   part from a password."

   In addition to key retrieval from escrow, there is also the variant
   of two parties exchanging public keys using a PAKE in lieu of
   certificates.  In this variant, public keys can be encrypted using a
   password.  Authentication key distribution can be performed because
   each side knows the private key associated with its unencrypted
   public key and can also decrypt the peer's public key.  This
   technique can be used to transform a short, one-time code into a
   long-term public key.

   Another possible variant of a PAKE scheme allows combining
   authentication with certificates and the use of passwords.  In this
   variant, the private key of the certificate is used to blind the
   password key agreement.  For verification, the message is unblinded
   with the public key.  A correct key establishment therefore implies
   the possession of the private key belonging to the certificate.  This
   method enables one-sided authentication as well as mutual
   authentication when the password is used.

   The authors of a PAKE scheme MAY discuss variations of their scheme
   and explain application scenarios where these variations are
   beneficial.  In particular, techniques that allow long-term (public)
   key agreement are encouraged.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Privacy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Privacy</span>

   In order to establish a connection, each party of the PAKE protocol
   needs to know the identity of its communication partner to identify
   the right password for the agreement.  In cases where a user wants to
   establish a secure channel with a server, the user first has to let
   the server know which password to use by sending some kind of
   identifier to the server.  If this identifier is not protected,
   everyone who is able to eavesdrop on the connection can identify the
   user.  In order to prevent this and protect the privacy of the user,

   the scheme might provide a way to protect the transmission of the
   user's identity.  A simple way to protect the privacy of a user that
   communicates with a server is to use a public key provided by the
   server to encrypt the user's identity.

   The PAKE scheme MAY discuss special ideas and solutions about how to
   protect the privacy of the users of the scheme.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20Performance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  Performance</span>

   The performance of a scheme can be judged along different lines
   depending on the optimization goals of the target application.
   Potential metrics include latency, code size/area, power consumption,
   or exchanged messages.  In addition, there might be application
   scenarios in which a constrained client communicates with a powerful
   server.  In such a case, the scheme has to require minimal efforts on
   the client side.  Note that for some clients, the computations might
   even be carried out in a hardware implementation, which requires
   different optimizations compared to software.

   Furthermore, the design of the scheme can influence the cost of
   protecting the implementation from adversaries exploiting its
   physical properties (see <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>).

   The authors of a PAKE scheme MAY discuss their design choices and the
   influence of these choices on the performance.  In particular, the
   optimization goals could be stated.
