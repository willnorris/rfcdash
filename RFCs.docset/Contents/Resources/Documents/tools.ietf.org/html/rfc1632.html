Abstract

   This document is the result of a survey that gathered new or updated
   descriptions of currently available implementations of X.500,
   including commercial products and openly available offerings. This
   document is a revision of <a href="rfc1292.html">RFC 1292</a>. We contacted each contributor in
   <a href="rfc1292.html">RFC 1292</a> and requested an update and published the survey template in
   several mailing lists and obtained new product descriptions.

   This document contains detailed description of twenty six (26) X.500
   implementations - DSAs, DUAs, and DUA interfaces.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document catalogs currently available implementations of X.500,
   including commercial products and openly available offerings.  For
   the purposes of this survey, we classify X.500 products as,

   DSA
        A DSA is an OSI application process that provides the Directory
        functionality,

   DUA
        A DUA is an OSI application process that represents a user in
        accessing the Directory and uses the DAP to communicate with a
        DSA, and

   DUA Interface
        A DUA Interface is an application process that represents a user
        in accessing the Directory using either DAP but supporting only
        a subset of the DAP functionality or a protocol different from
        DAP to communicate with a DSA or DUA.

   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> of this document contains a listing of implementations
   cross referenced by keyword.  This list should aid in identifying
   implementations that meet your criteria.

   To compile this catalog, the IDS Working Group solicited input from
   the X.500 community by surveying several Internet mailing lists,
   including:  iso@nic.ddn.mil, isode@nic.ddn.mil, osi-ds@cs.ucl.ac.uk,
   and ietf-ids@umich.edu. We also contacted many people by telephone
   and sent the template to several individuals and mailed a floppy disk
   containing the survey template to a person who did not have Internet
   access.

   Readers are encouraged to submit comments regarding both the form and
   content  of  this  memo.  New submissions are welcome.  Please direct
   input to  the  Integrated  Directory  Services  (IDS)  Working  Group
   (ietf-ids@umich.edu)  or  to  the editors.  IDS will produce new ver-
   sions of this document when a sufficient number of changes have  been
   received.  This will be determined by the IDS chairpersons.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1%20%20Purpose"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>  Purpose</span>

   The Internet has experienced a steady growth in X.500 piloting
   activities.  This document hopes to provide an easily accessible
   source of information on X.500 implementations for those who wish to
   consider X.500 technology for deploying a Directory service.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2%20%20Scope"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>  Scope</span>

   This document contains descriptions of both free and commercial X.500
   implementations.  It does not provide instructions on how to install,
   run, or manage these implementations.  The descriptions and indices
   are provided to make the readers aware of available options and thus
   enable more informed choices.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3%20Disclaimer"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a> Disclaimer</span>

   Implementation descriptions were written by implementors and vendors,
   and not by the editors. We worked with the description authors to
   ensure uniformity and readability, but can not guarantee the accuracy
   or completeness of the descriptions, or the stability of the
   implementations.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.4%20%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.4" name="section-1.4">1.4</a>  Overview</span>

   <a href="#section-1">Section 1</a> contains introductory information.

   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> contains a list of keywords, their definitions, and a cross
   reference of the X.500 implementations by these keywords.

   The creation of this catalog would not have been possible without the
   efforts of the description authors and the members of the IDS Working
   Group.  Our special thanks to the editors of <a href="rfc1292.html">RFC 1292</a>, Ruth Lang and
   Russ Wright who helped us get started and made key suggestions that
   enabled us to learn from their experience. We also acknowledge and
   appreciate the efforts of Ken Rossen in obtaining six descriptions.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Keywords"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Keywords</span>

   Keywords are abbreviated attributes of the X.500 implementations.
   The list of keywords defined below was derived from the
   implementation descriptions themselves.  Implementations were indexed
   by a keyword either as a result of: (1) explicit, not implied,
   reference to a particular capability in the implementation
   description text, or (2) input from the implementation description
   author(s).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1%20%20Keyword%20Definitions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>  Keyword Definitions</span>

   This section contains keyword definitions.  They have been organized
   and grouped by functional category.  The definitions are ordered
   first alphabetically by keyword category, and second alphabetically
   by implementation name within keyword category.


<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.1%20%20Availability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1.1" name="section-2.1.1">2.1.1</a>  Availability</span>

ABSTRACT

   X500-DS and X500-DUA are integral part of the large Bull OSI offer.
   Although based on the DCE/GDS (Distributed Computing
   Environment/Global Directory Service) of OSF, these two products may
   be installed and used without DCE environment.  X500-DS is designed
   to implement both the DUA and the DSA functions, whilst X500-DUA only
   provides the DUA functions.

   The X500-DUA package contains:

   - The standards APIs XOM (X/Open OSI-Abstract-Data Manipulation API)
     and XDS (X/Open Directory Service API) for the development of

ABSTRACT

   OSI Access and Directory includes several DUAs and a QUIPU based DSA
   (originally based on version 6.6) with enhancements. The DUA/DSA
   enhancements include:

   - Directory API based on the X.400 API.
   - Support for X.400 objects including those to support
     MHS use of Directory to support MHS Routing.
   - Integration with Control Data's MailHub (X.400 MHS) products.
   - X Windows, curses and command line based DUA interfaces on UNIX.
     These interfaces support the full set of Directory operations.
   - Windows 3.x interface on PCs.
   - A DUA daemon that provides Directory access for applications.
   - LDAP 2.0 and 3.0 support.
   - Directory synchronization tools for synchronizing most PC/Mac/Dec
     mail directories with X.500.
   - Enhanced photo attribute support.
   - ACL enhancements.
   - Hash indexing for fast string search.
   - DIXIE, DAD and PH.X500 support.
   - SNMP based monitoring and management of DSAs.


   Control Data Systems offers complete integration services to design,
   plan, install, configure, tailor and maintain X.500 services.  These
   services may include the preparation of customer unique DUAs and
   tools for X.500 integration, synchronization, operational control and
   management. OSI Access and Directory is in production use at several
   government, commercial and academic sites. Some sites are supporting
   Directories in excess of 120,000 entries.

   1202], [<a href="rfc1249.html">RFC 1249</a>], [<a href="rfc1275.html">RFC 1275</a>], [<a href="rfc1278.html">RFC 1278</a>], and [<a href="rfc1279.html">RFC 1279</a>].

   OSI Access and Directory also supports the required objects,
   attributes and attribute syntaxes for MHS use of Directory to support
   MHS Routing.

INTEROPERABILITY

   OSI Access and Directory was tested against HP, DEC, ISODE Consortium
   and Wollongong implementations at the COS Interoperability Test Lab
   in May 1993. The OSINET Interoperability Tests were used. Please
   refer OSINET for test results. OSI Access and Directory has also been
   informally tested at trade shows with implementations from UNISYS and
   Retix.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   OSI Access and Directory is connected via DSAs and DUAs to the PSI
   White Pages Project. OSI Access and Directory provides the base
   routing tree for the MHS Use of Directory pilot (Longbud) on the
   Internet.

ABSTRACT

   The implementation consists of a set DUA library routines, a terminal
   interface, and a DSA. The implementation was developed in C on Sun
   SPARCstations under SunOS 4.1.1. All underlying services are provided
   by the ISODE development package. The development package is also
   used for encoding and decoding ASN.1 data as well as for other data
   manipulation services. Using the ISODE package the implementation can
   be run over both TCP/IP and OSI protocols.

   The DSA provides full support for both DAP and DSP protocols,
   conformant with ISO 9594 / CCITT X.500 standards. The DIB is
   maintained using a locally developed relational database system. The
   interface to the database system consists of a set of sql-like C
   functions.  These are designed to allow straightforward replacement
   of the local database system with a more powerful commercial system.
   To achieve better performance several options are supported that
   permit loading of selected portions of the database in core. When
   these options are selected data can be retrieved more quickly from in
   core tables; all modifications to the DIB are directly reflected in
   the in core tables and the database.

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   Custos is fully compliant with the 1988 Standard with the following
   omissions:

   - Search request decomposition
   - Modify Entry operation
   - Modify RDN operation
   - Abandon operation
   - Strong Authentication
   - Schema checking

INTEROPERABILITY

   Have successfully interoperated with QUIPU and OSIWARE over the DAP.

BUGS

   Bugs may be reported to the general discussion list,

CAVEATS and GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   No limitations on file sizes, etc. The only side effects to creating
   large files should be in the area of performance. Specifically,
   optimization requires loading parts of the DIB in core so greater
   memory requirements will be necessary for achieving better
   performance with a large database. Any platform the implementation
   can be ported to (generally any platform ISODE can be ported to)
   should support all features.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   It requires UNIX and the ISODE software package. It's been developed
   and tested with ISODE version 7.0 and Sun OS version 4.1.1. Uses a
   locally developed relational DBMS that should be easily replaceable
   with commercially available relational systems.

AVAILABILITY

   Custos, the NIST implementation of X.500, the OSI Directory, is
   available for anonymous ftp from osi.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.48.100)
   using the convention (user name = anonymous, password = ident). The
   software is available in two forms: a tar file and a compressed tar
   file.

      ./pub/directory/CustosRel_0.2.tar
      ./pub/directory/CustosRel_0.2.tar.Z

   Note: permissions on the directory ./pub/directory are set so that
   you will be able to "get" files whose names you can provide. However,
   you will not be able to "ls" the contents of the directory.

ABSTRACT

   DE (Directory Enquiries) is intended to be a simple-to-use DUA
   interface, suitable for the naive user, and suitable for running as a
   public access dua.  it will work on any terminal.  The user is
   presented with a series of (verbose) prompts asking for person's
   name; department; organization; country.  There is extensive on-line
   help.  The matching algorithms are such that near matches are
   presented to the user before less good matches.

   A lot of development has been done on the interface since it was
   first described in <a href="rfc1292.html">RFC1292</a>.  The most significant enhancement has
   been to add power searching - this allows a user to search for an
   entry even when they do not know the name of the organisation in
   which the person works - you still have to specify the country.  DE
   now provides UFN style searching.  It is now possible to search
   locality entries.  DE now uses slightly different search algorithms
   depending on whether it is accessing part of the Directory mastered
   by a Quipu DSA - Quipu DSAs tend to use lots of replication and so
   encourage searching.  An experimental feature is intended to give the
   user more feedback on the likely response time to a query - DE
   maintains a database of past information availability and DSA
   responsiveness.  Translations exist into at least 4 different
   languages.

   DE runs over ISODE DAP and University of Michigan LDAP.  There is a
   version of DE, called DOS-DE, which has been ported to DOS, and this
   uses LDAP.

   DE was funded by the COSINE PARADISE project, and DE is used as the
   PARADISE public access dua.  You can test the software by telnet to
   128.86.8.56 and logging in as dua -- no password required.

   (Distributed Computing Environment/Global Directory Service) is
   based.  It supports full DUA and DSA functionality for globally
   unique identification and location of objects in a network. It also
   provides functions to answer queries (both yellow-page and white-
   page) about objects and attribute information. The software
   implements full DAP and DSP protocols specified in X.519. The
   required ACSE, ROSE, Presentation, Session and <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC-1006</a> protocol
   implementations are also included. It also supports <a href="rfc1277.html">RFC-1277</a>.

   Additional features include proprietary Replication and Access
   Control, Caching, Tree-handling utilities and (Remote)
   Administration.

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   Consists of both DUA and DSA implementations according to the CCITT
   X.500 (1988) and ISO 9594 standard. The X/Open standard APIs for XDS
   and XOM are provided. The XDS interface can also be used to access
   the OSF DCE/CDS (DCE local Cell Directory Service) transparently.

   DIR.X has been successfully conformance tested. PICS and PCTRs are
   available for all tested protocols: DSA/DAP, DUA/DAP, Presentation,
   ACSE and Session embedded in X.500.

   Compliant with EWOS Agreements (which are being harmonized with OIW
   Agreements).

   Strong authentication according to X.509 and an XDS/XOM convenience
   library will be included in the next version (Q2 1994). Support for
   X.500 (1993) is planned for Q4 1994.

ABSTRACT

   Directory 500 (D500) is a comprehensive implementation of the CCITT
   X.500 recommendations. D500 is comprised of two major components
   which are responsible for manipulating the data in the OSI Directory.
   They are the Directory User Agent (DUA) and the Directory System
   Agent (DSA).

   The DUA is the interface between the OSI Directory and those users
   wishing access to the Directory's information. Users make their
   requests through the DUA. When forwarding user's requests to the OSI
   Directory, the protocol used is known as the Directory Access
   Protocol (DAP).

   The DSA will negotiate with other, remote DSAs to obtain requested
   information or to update remote DIBs. DSAs use the Directory System
   Protocol (DSP) to forward and answer these requests. The DSA supports
   chaining and referrals.

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   All X.500 1988 operations are supported along with all Object Classes
   specified in X.521 and all Attribute Types specified in X.520.

   Implementation plans include upgrades to support the 1992 extensions
   to X.500 in 1994. Please check with OSIware / Infonet Software
   Solutions for availability dates.

ABSTRACT

   DOS-DE (DOS Directory Enquiries) is intended to be a simple-to-use
   DUA interface suitable for the naive user.  It is an MS-DOS port of
   the standard UNIX DE implementation - see the entry on DE for full
   details.  (All of the features DE are supported apart from the
   experimental `Quality of Service' code).

   The user is presented with a series of (verbose) prompts asking for
   person's name; department; organization; country.  There is extensive
   on-line help.  The matching algorithms are such that near matches are
   presented to the user before less good matches.  `Power searching' is
   also available - this allows a user to search for an entry even when
   they do not know the name of the organisation in which the person
   works - you still have to specify the country.  DOS-DE provides UFN
   style searching.  It is also possible to search locality entries.
   DOS-DE uses slightly different search algorithms depending on whether
   it is accessing part of the Directory mastered by a Quipu DSA - Quipu
   DSAs tend to use lots of replication and so encourage searching.

   DOS-DE runs over the University of Michigan LDAP.

   DE was funded by the COSINE PARADISE project.  DOS-DE was developed
   by Andy Powell at the University of Bath.

CAVEATS and GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   DOS-DE tries to cater well for the general case, at the expense of
   not dealing with the less typical.  The main manifestation of this is
   that the current version does not handle searching under localities
   very well.

   It is not possible to display photographs or reproduce sound
   attributes.

ABSTRACT

   HP X.500 Distributed Directory. Its main components are:

       DUA, and DUA Interface,
       DSA and DIB support,
       X.500 Address Lookup,
       X/Open Application Tool Kit API (XAT) for XDS/XOM Interface,
       X.500 High Level API (X5HLAPI) for XDS/XOM Interface.

   HP X.500 DUA. Its main components are:

       DUA, and DUA Interface,
       X.500 Address Look-up,
       X/Open Application Tool Kit API (XAT) for XDS/XOM Interface,
       X.500 High Level API (X5HLAPI) for XDS/XOM Interface.

   HP X.500 Distributed Directory is based on the 1988 CCITT X.500
   standard.  HP X.500 can be used for accessing names and electronic
   mail addresses for multi-vendor messaging backbone networks. HP X.500
   can also be used for the development of networked applications
   requiring distributed directory functionality.

   HP OpenMail users can access the enterprise wide HP X.500 distributed
   directory directly from the HP OpenMail user interface, and select
   X.500 addresses for mailing. HP-UX Sendmail users can access
   electronic mail addresses from a X.500 server over a TCP/IP network.

   Users of non-HP e-mail systems can access data stored in the X.500
   Directory using X.500 Address Look-up. X.500 Address Look-up has an
   easy to use interface, and phonetic search capability.

   HP X.500 Distributed Directory includes a complete multi-threaded DUA
   and DSA. The X.500 DIB is built on a database which has been
   optimized for X.500 performance. HP X.500 contains full support for
   DAP and DSP protocols.

   Data Shadowing and security access control of HP X.500 Distributed
   Directory allow higher performance, and easier management of its DIB
   database in a global environment.

   HP X.500 Distributed Directory has menu driven administration and
   user interface tools. The tools simplify directory configuration and
   data retrieval. It supports X/Open X.500 APIs (XDS and XOM), and high
   level APIs on top of XDS to allow developers to write their own X.500
   based applications.

   HP X.500 Distributed Directory supports comprehensive tracing and
   logging facilities for quick diagnosis and resolution of problems. HP
   also provides a rich set of troubleshooting tools to check the
   interoperability of the network at various layers of the OSI stack.

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   HP X.500 Distributed Directory complies with the following standards:

     CCITT X.501:  The Directory - Models
     CCITT X.509:  The Directory - Authentications Framework*
     CCITT X.511:  The Directory - Abstract Service Definition
     CCITT X.518:  The Directory - Procedures for Distributed Operations
     CCITT X.519:  The Directory - Protocol Specifications
     CCITT X.520:  The Directory - Selected Attribute Types
     CCITT X.521:  The Directory - Selected Object Classes
     CCITT X.219:  Remote Operations - Model, Notation and Service
   Definition
     CCITT X.229:  Remote Operations - Protocol Specifications

     *x.509 describes simple and strong authentication. HP X.500
      Distributed Directory supports simple authentication. Strong
      authentication is not supported in the current release due to
      limited market demand.

   HP X.500 Distributed Directory will comply with NIST and EWOS
   directory functional profiles. Based on factors such as market needs
   and NIST recommendations, HP will implement subsets of 1992 CCITT
   functionality in a phased approach.

ABSTRACT

   LDAP is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.  It gives X.500
   access to platforms that have only TCP/IP access, using simplified
   BER encoding of many X.500 data elements.  LDAP is currently a
   proposed Internet Standard.  The LDAP server is an intermediate
   protocol server that communicates with Internet clients on one side
   using the simple TCP-based LDAP protocol and an X.500 DSA on the
   other side using the Directory Access Protocol (DAP).  A subset of
   the X.500 DAP is exported to the clients through the LDAP protocol.

   The U-M LDAP distribution contains the following components:

   - LDAP server
   - LDAP client library, including both synchronous and asynchronous APIs
   - Lightweight BER library, including an API that supports
     a printf/scanf-like interface
   - Various LDAP client programs, including a finger daemon (xfingerd),
     gopher to X.500 gateway (go500gw), command-line DUA (ud), e-mail
     query server (rcpt500), and an X.500 mailer (mail500)


COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   The U-M LDAP distribution is a complete implementation of the LDAP
   protocol.  The LDAP protocol does not support access to all X.500
   features and operations.  The operations supported are bind, search,
   compare, add, delete, modify, modify RDN, and abandon.  Note that
   read and list operations can be emulated using the search operation.
   Size and time limits may be specified, as may alias dereferencing and
   searching, but all X.500 service controls are not supported.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   Compliant with [<a href="rfc1485.html">RFC 1485</a>], [<a href="rfc1487.html">RFC 1487</a>], and [<a href="rfc1274.html">RFC 1274</a>].

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs

   Preliminary support is included for [<a href="rfc1484.html">RFC 1484</a>].

INTEROPERABILITY

   The current implementation of the LDAP server is known to work with
   the QUIPU DSA and DAP library.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   DUA connectivity should be possible to all pilots, though only
   AARNET, PARADISE, and PSI White Pages Project have actually been
   tried.

BUGS

   Bug reports should be sent to bug-ldap@umich.edu.

CAVEATS and GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   None, aside from those mentioned above under completeness.

INTERNETWORKING ENVIRONMENT

   LDAP clients use TCP to communicate with the LDAP server.  The LDAP
   server normally uses <a href="rfc1006.html">RFC 1006</a> with TCP/IP to communicate with the
   DSA, though any other transport mechanism for DSA communication
   supported by ISODE should be possible.

HARDWARE PLATFORMS

   The LDAP server is known to run on Sun 3 and Sun 4 platforms DEC's,
   HP's, and RS 6000's.  The LDAP client libraries and some clients have
   been ported to the Macintosh and the PC.

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS

   The LDAP server and clients are known to run under and SunOS 4.1.x,
   ULTRIX, HP-UX, and AIX.  The LDAP client libraries also work under
   Macintosh System 6.0 or higher and MS-DOS 5.0.

ABSTRACT

   MXLU (Motif/X LookUp) is an X.500 DUA interface for the X Window
   System using Motif.

   Ported from the Athena widgets version, MXLU can be configured for
   many different styles of interaction. Example configurations are
   provided for single window and multiple window use.

   MXLU implements the `User-Friendly Naming' search strategy and also
   has a form-filling search mode. Asynchronous directory operations are
   used.

   Full user friendly add and modify functions are provided, with the

   gateway that includes an integrated X.500 DSA/DUA. It supports full
   DUA and DSA functions as well as full DAP and DSP protocols specified
   in X.519. The DSA may be used exclusively for enterprise-wide
   messaging, or as a general purpose X.500 DSA. The product has
   successfully participated in OSInet X.500 I-Lab interoperability
   tests.

   PathWay Messenger is an email application for desktop class machines
   with a limited functionality DUA Light Weight Client that provides
   access (per <a href="rfc1202.html">RFC 1202</a>, Directory Assistance Service - support for LDAP
   is planned) over TCP/IP to the X.500 DSA/DUA included with PathWay
   Messaging Services.

   PathWay Messaging Services is a complete implementation of the 1988
   X.500 Recommendations with the exception of strong authentication as
   outlined in X.509.  It is conformant to NIST, EWOS, and UK GOSIP
   Directory profiles. It provides network through application layer
   protocol support, with support for all attribute types, syntaxes, and
   object classes defined in X.520 and X.521. Support for 1992
   extensions to X.500 is planned for future release as is support for
   X/Open Object Management (OM) and X/Open Directory Services (XDS)
   standards.

ABSTRACT

   The NASA QuickMail/X.500 Interface program is a program which
   translates QuickMail name service requests into X.500 requests and
   returns the results from the DSA to the QuickMail user.  This system
   allows QuickMail users  the ability to find non-QuickMail users' or
   non-local QuickMail users' addresses, while retaining the normal
   QuickMail lookup interface.  The program speaks QuickMail name
   service protocol on one side, and DAP on the other.

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   [Same as dish] -- does not support strong authentication.  No support
   for 1992 extensions needed.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   <a href="rfc1274.html">RFC 1274</a> supported to the extent that we use provided schema to store
   QuickMail addresses.

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs

   [No information provided--Ed.]

INTEROPERABILITY

   Works with Quipu (ISODE 8.0, ICR1)

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   Connected to PSI WPPP, PARADISE.  Other projects may use data if they
   are connected to either of these DSAs.

BUGS

   No known bugs.  Default QuickMail name service lookup time out of 10
   seconds may be too fast for some DSAs to respond to.

ABSTRACT

   This implementation is a source release derived from the earlier
   openly available version of QUIPU, and will be used as base
   technology for products by a number of vendors. The release comprises
   of a DSA, and a number of sample DUAs which may be used in
   conjunction with the DSA.

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   The DSA is aligned to the 1988 ISO IS and the NIST OIW Directory
   Implementors Guide Version 1, with the following exceptions:

   - Strong authentication is not implemented (but hooks are
     provided for use with two packages).
   - QUIPU does not enforce the bounds constraints on attributes,
     filters or APDU size.
   - T.61 string formatting characters are not rejected.
   - If a DN is supplied with no password in an unprotected simple bind,
     QUIPU does not always check to see if the DN exists. If the DSA
     connected to can say authoritatively the DN does not exist, the
     association is rejected. However, if a chain operation is required
     to check the DN, the bind IS allowed.
   - When comparing attributes of UTCtime syntax, if the seconds field
     is omitted, QUIPU does not perform the match correctly (i.e., the
     seconds field in the attribute values should be ignored, but are
     not).
   - QUIPU always supplies the optional Chaining argument
     "originator" even if the CommonArgument "requestor" is used.
   - QUIPU always supplies the optional Chaining argument "target"
     even if the base object in the DAP arguments is the same.
   - The object class "without an assigned object identifier" is
     not recognised unless the "alias" object class is also present.
   - Non Specific Subordinate References are never followed by a QUIPU
     DSA, but they are passed on correctly to the client if generated.

NAME

   Traxis Enterprise Directory
   Angeli Systems Corporation


KEYWORDS

   API, CLNS, Commercially Available, DSA/DUA, HP, IBM PC, IBM RISC,

ABSTRACT

   The Traxis Enterprise Directory has multiple components in a three
   layer architecture. The individual components of the Traxis family
   are building blocks which can be assembled in a flexible, modular way
   to build complex systems.

   At the enterprise level, is a distributed directory stored and
   managed by Traxis Directory Engines (TDEs). At the workgroup level
   Traxis Directory Hubs (TDHs) provide the means to integrate and
   connect Traxis Directory Engines to the wide variety of real world
   applications and systems which prevail in network environments. The
   TDE and the TDH support the myriad of client applications, including
   messaging and business applications, which require services from the
   Traxis directory.

   At the desktop level, the Traxis Desktop Client (TDC) provides a
   common set of facilities which simplify and enable communications,
   object manipulation, and results management as required between the
   Traxis Directory Hub and applications. These capabilities, which
   include full access and management of the directory, are provided to
   applications through XDS++, the Traxis object oriented API. The
   Traxis Desktop Client also supports industry standard client software
   interfaces such as Microsoft MAPI, Apple OCE, CMC and VIM, through
   Compatibility Modules which map the standard API into XDS++. Through
   these APIs the Traxis Desktop Client supports applications of all
   kinds on PC, Macintosh, and UNIX systems.

   Angeli supplied Traxis applications include the Traxis Administrative
   Console management station, the Traxis Global Browser general
   directory tool, the Traxis Operator Assistance high-speed look-up,
   the Traxis Data Base Gateway, the Traxis Import Export Utility and
   more.

   The Traxis Directory Engine includes an X.500 DSA. The Traxis
   Directory Hub includes an X.500 DUA.

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   Traxis Directory Engine DSA is CCITT-1988 compliant with extended
   security and access control. Supports access control on User, Entry,
   and Attribute levels. DIB or subtree administrative manager
   supported. Supports simple authentication with encrypted password.

   NIST OIW Stable Implementation Agreements [<a href="#ref-NIST-88" title='"Stable Implementation Agreements for Open Systems Interconnection Protocols"'>NIST-88</a>] compliant.

   Support for February 14, 1993 CCITT X.500 planned. X.509 in first
   half of 1994. Replication and Administrative/Information Model in
   second half of 1994.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   Traxis conforms to <a href="rfc1274.html">RFC1274</a> which documents COSINE interoperability.

   LDAP (<a href="rfc1487.html">RFC 1487</a>) is planned for inclusion in a later release of Traxis
   if market demand requires it.

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs

   Traxis does not conform to the QUIPU RFC Internet Proposals cited.
   As noted elsewhere, Traxis is fully compatible with QUIPU
   operationally but does not use the cited RFCs in its internal
   operations.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Traxis has been extensively tested for interoperability with ISODE
   QUIPU Version 8. Traxis Directory Engine (DSA) will serve DISH or
   other QUIPU DUAs using DAP. Traxis Directory Hub interoperates with
   QUIPU DSA. All directory access functions and their chained
   equivalents are interoperable.

PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   PARADISE DUA/DSA connectivity tested.

ABSTRACT

   UCOM.X 500 includes a Directory System Agent (DSA), various directory
   access APIs and Directory User Agents (DUAs). UCOM.X 500 is a product
   based on PIZARRO, the research prototype developed at INRIA by
   Christian Huitema's team, and commercialized by TS-E3X, a member of
   the France Telecom group.

   Characteristics of the DSA are:

   - The DAP and DSP protocols are provided conformant with X.500 (88).
   - The DIB is maintained in ASN.1 encoded format in the Unix file
     system.  Utilities are provided to load and dump the DIB from and
     to ASCII text files.
   - The DIT structure is held in main memory. Frequently used attributes
     may be held in inverted tables in memory to speed up searches.
   - Knowledge management: knowledge on managed domains is stored in
     UCOM.X specific attributes of the DSA entries.
   - Schema: The X.500 (88), X.400 (88) and most of the Cosine and
     Internet Schema are supported. Object class and attribute
     definitions are enforced.  Users may define their own.
   - Simple authentication is provided; strong authentication and
     signed operations are being tested operationally through TS-E3X's
     participation in PASSWORD, a VALUE project with aim to pilot a
     European security infrastructure for network applications.
   - Access control: private mechanisms are provided to allow access
     control lists to be specified for parts of the DIT, to control
     modifications, and to specify access restrictions on attributes.
   - Management: a UCOM.X DSA object has been defined to allow
     operational parameters of the DSA to be managed via DAP.
     Administration utilities are provided to, e.g., generate usage
     statistics and periodically update the database from various data
     sources including a knowledge discovery tool.


   The product offers a C language API conformant to X/Open's X/DS



<span class="grey">IDS Working Group                                              [Page 74]</span></pre>

   specification, and a C++ API (for release 10/93).

   The DUAs include a graphical directory browser with powerful search
   functionality for OpenLook and Motif, and a full-screen curses-based
   interface with full DAP functionality.

   TS-E3X's strategy for UCOM.X500 is three-fold: Firstly, to use it as
   the directory service for Spheris, France Telecom's range of
   electronic mail products based on X.400 (88) (release mid '94).
   Secondly, to offer it to third parties developing specific
   applications using X.500: current applications include a distributed
   application to control document transfer in a large French hospital
   and distributed applications management in the French Post Office;
   planned uses include office applications for control of document
   circulation (workflow) and cooperative document editing. Thirdly, to
   offer it to telecomms operators such as France Telecom for
   application in network management. UCOM.X 500 is used extensively by
   French research centers involved in PARADISE.

COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   UCOM.X 500 conforms to X.500 (88) as specified in paragraph 9 of
   X.519.

   Development of the product based on X.500 (93) is planned for '94
   with release of a product conformant to the principal extensions at
   the end of '94. Emphasis is being placed on the shadowing protocol,
   the schema and access control.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   The COSINE and Internet Schema (<a href="rfc1274.html">RFC 1274</a>) is supported with minor
   exceptions.

   The string representation of PSAPs and their internal encoding
   conforms to <a href="rfc1277.html">RFC 1277</a>.

   The string representation of DNs will migrate to the Internet <a href="rfc1485.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc1485.html">1485</a> definition.

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs

   <a href="rfc1279.html">RFC 1279</a> (X.500 and Domains) is supported. The string representation
   of PSAPs and their internal encoding conforms to <a href="rfc1278.html">RFC 1278</a>.

   AFRO (algorithme francais de recherche optimise), the search / name
   resolution algorithm proposed by UCOM.X 500, differs from the UFN
   algorithm principally in that it attempts to optimize by performing



<span class="grey">IDS Working Group                                              [Page 75]</span></pre>

   read operations before resorting to searches in order to exploit the
   name error information.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Through UCOM.X 500's use in the French PARADISE pilot,
   interoperability has been informally but extensively tested with
   Quipu and other implementations.

   Detailed interoperability tests  with Quipu, Marben and  Siemens/Bull
   DIR/X are being conducted by  the PARADISE OIFP (Operational
   Interworking) team at INRIA Rocquencourt, France.

   The product  is currently also undergoing  formal tests for
   conformance to the CTS2  DSA/DAP and  ACSE/Presentation/Session
   specifications  at the  French OSI conformance test centre.


PILOT CONNECTIVITY

   DSA and DUA connectivity to the PARADISE pilot.

BUGS

   UCOM.X 500 is a commercial product. As such, it is supported and bugs
   are fixed when detected. Bug reports can be sent to our support team
   via electronic mail.

CAVEATS AND GENERAL LIMITATIONS

   The DIT structure and inverted attribute tables are stored in main
   memory. The recommended main memory size for a DSA is 1 kb per node,
   i.e., 10 Mb for a database of 10,000 objects. The current recommended
   maximum is a database size of the order of 100,000 objects.

   Of the selected attribute types defined in X.500 (88), the
   searchGuide attribute is not supported ; neither are the following
   attributes from the Cosine and Internet Schema (<a href="rfc1274.html">RFC 1274</a>):
   OtherMailbox, MailPreferenceOption and the various quality
   attributes.

   The X/DS API supports the Basic Directory Contents (BDCP), the MHS
   Directory User (MDUP) and the Strong Authentication (SAP) packages
   with minor limitations. A proprietary mechanism for defining new
   classes and attributes is offered. Asynchronous operations and
   multiple concurrent sessions are not supported. Whilst referral may
   be handled automatically, continuation references are not.

   <a href="rfc1484.html">RFC-1484</a>, Source, Sun, UNIX, X Window System

ABSTRACT

   Xdi is a Directory User Agent (DUA) for the X Window System.  In
   addition to providing a user-friendly interface, it supports
   Directory interactions of different levels of complexity. Users can
   select different window screens to browse, search and modify the
   Directory.  There are two different search screens for name based
   search and attribute based search. It is simple to use for novice
   users but is also useful for more advanced users to formulate complex
   search filters.  Xdi also supports "user-friendly naming" in many
   cases so that users are not required to know X.500 naming format.


COMPLIANCE (applicable only for DSAs and DUAs)

   88 standard compliant: Delete and Add operations, and strong
   authentication not implemented. There are no facilities to modify the
   RDNs of entries.

CONFORMANCE WITH PROPOSED INTERNET STANDARDS

   <a href="rfc1274.html">RFC 1274</a> is supported.

CONSISTENCE WITH INFORMATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RFCs

   <a href="rfc1484.html">RFC 1484</a> is supported.

INTEROPERABILITY

   Believed to be interoperable with other DSAs. Only tested against
   ISODE/QUIPU DSAs.
