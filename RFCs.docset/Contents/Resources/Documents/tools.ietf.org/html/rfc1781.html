        <span class="h1">Using the OSI Directory to Achieve User Friendly Naming</span>

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   The OSI Directory has user friendly naming as a goal.  A simple
   minded usage of the directory does not achieve this.  Two aspects not
   achieved are:

    o  A user oriented notation

    o  Guessability

   This proposal sets out some conventions for representing names in a
   friendly manner, and shows how this can be used to achieve really
   friendly naming.  This then leads to a specification of a standard
   format for representing names, and to procedures to resolve them.
   This leads to a specification which allows directory names to be
   communicated between humans.  The format in this specification is
   identical to that defined in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"A String Representation of Distinguished Names"'>5</a>], and it is intended that these
   specifications are compatible.

   Many OSI Applications make use of Distinguished Names (DN) as defined
   in the OSI Directory [<a href="#ref-1" title="models and services">1</a>].  The main reason for having a notation for
   name format is to interact with a user interface.  This specification
   is coming dangerously close to the sin of standardising interfaces.
   However, there are aspects of presentation which it is desirable to
   standardise.

   It is important to have a common format to be able to conveniently
   refer to names.  This might be done to represent a directory name on
   a business card or in an email message.  There is a need for a format
   to support human to human communication, which must be string based
   (not ASN.1) and user oriented.

   In very many cases, a user will be required to input a name.  This
   notation is designed to allow this to happen in a uniform manner
   across many user interfaces.  The intention is that the name can just
   be typed in.  There should not be any need to engage in form filling
   or complex dialogue.  It should be possible to take the "human"
   description given at the meeting, and use it directly.  The means in
   which this happens will become clear later.

   This approach uses the syntax defined in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"A String Representation of Distinguished Names"'>5</a>] for representing
   distinguished names.  By relaxing some of the constraints on this
   specification, it is argued that a more user oriented specification
   is produced.  However, this syntax cannot be mapped algorithmically
   onto a distinguished name without the use of a directory.

   This notation is targeted towards a general user oriented system, and
   in particular to represent the names of humans.  Other syntaxes may
   be more appropriate for other uses of the directory.  For example,
   the OSF Syntax may be more appropriate for some system oriented uses.

   (The OSF Syntax uses "/" as a separator, and forms names in a manner
   intended to resemble UNIX filenames).

   This notation is targeted towards names which follow a particular DIT
   structure:  organisationally oriented.  This may make it
   inappropriate for some types of application.  There may be a
   requirement to extend this notation to deal more cleanly with fully
   geographical names.

   This approach effectively defines a definition of descriptive names
   on top of the primitive names defined by the OSI Directory.

   The notation used in this specification is defined in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"A String Representation of Distinguished Names"'>5</a>].  This
   notation defines an unambiguous representation of distinguished name,
   and this specification is designed to be used in conjunction with
   this format.  Both specifications arise from the same piece of
   research work [<a href="#ref-4" title=" University College London">4</a>].  Some examples of the specification are given
   here.  The author's User Friendly Name (UFN) might be written:

   Steve Kille, Computer Science, University College London, GB

   or

   S. Kille, Computer Science, University College London, GB

   This may be folded, perhaps to display in multi-column format.  For
   example:

   Steve Kille,
   Computer Science,
   University College London,
   GB

   Another UFN might be:

   Christian Huitema, INRIA, FR

   or
   James Hacker,
   Basingstoke,
   Widget Inc,
   GB

   The final example shows quoting of a comma in an Organisation name:

   L. Eagle, "Sue, Grabbit and Runn", GB

   A purported name is what a user supplies to an interface for
   resolution into one or more distinguished names.  A system should
   almost always store a name as a distinguished name.  This will be
   more efficient, and avoid problems with purported names which become
   ambiguous when a new name appears.  A user interface may display a
   distinguished name, using the distinguished name notation.  However,
   it may display a purported name in cases where this will be more
   pleasing to the user.  Examples of this might be:

   o  Omission of the higher components of the distinguished name are
      not displayed (abbreviation).

   o  Omission of attribute types, where the type is unlikely to be
      needed to resolve ambiguity.

   The ways in which a purported name may vary from a distinguished name
   are now described:

   Type Omission

   There are two cases of this.

     o  Schema defaulting.  In this case, although the type is not
        present, a schema defaulting is used to deduce the type.  The
        first two types of schema defaulting may be used to deduce a
        distinguished name without the use of the directory.  The use
        of schema defaulting may be useful to improve the performance
        of UFN resolution.  The types of schema defaulting are:

        --  Default Schema

        --  Context Dependent Default Schema

        --  Data Dependent Default Schema

     o  Omission of the type to be resolved by searching.

   Default Schema

   The attribute type of an attribute may always be present.  This may
   be done to emphasise the type structure of a name.  In some cases,
   the typing may be omitted.  This is done in a way so that in many
   common cases, no attribute types are needed.  The following type
   hierarchy (schema) is assumed:







<span class="grey">Kille                                                           [Page 4]</span></pre>

   Common Name, (((Organisational Unit)*,  Organisation,) Country).

   Explicitly typed RDNs may be inserted into this hierarchy at any
   point.  The least significant component is always of type Common
   Name.  Other types follow the defined organisational hierarchy.
   The following are equivalent:

   Filestore Access, Bells, Computer Science,
   University College London, GB

   and

   CN=Filestore Access, OU=Bells, OU=Computer Science,
   O=University College London, C=GB

   To interpet a distinguished name presented in this format, with some
   or all of the attributes with the type not specified, the types are
   derived according to the type hierarchy by the following algorithm:

    1.  If the first attribute type is not specified, it is
        CommonName.

    2.  If the last attribute type is not specified, it is Country.

    3.  If there is no organisation explicitly specified, the last
        attribute with type not specified is of type Organisation.

    4.  Any remaining attribute with type unspecified must be before
        an Organisation or OrganisationalUnit attribute, and is of
        type OrganisationalUnit.

   To take a distinguished name, and generate a name of this format with
   attribute types omitted, the following steps are followed.

    1.  If the first attribute is of type CommonName, the type may be
        omitted.

    2.  If the last attribute is of type Country, the type may be
        omitted.

    3.  If the last attribute is of type Country, the last
        Organisation attribute may have the type omitted.

    4.  All attributes of type OrganisationalUnit may have the type
        omitted, unless they are after an Organisation attribute or
        the first attribute is of type OrganisationalUnit.

   Context Dependent Default Schema

   The distinguished name notation defines a fixed schema for type
   defaulting.  It may be useful to have different defaults in different
   contexts.  For example, the defaulting convention may be applied in a
   modified fashion to objects which are known not to be common name
   objects.  This will always be followed if the least significant
   component is explicitly typed.  In this case, the following hierarchy
   is followed:

   ((Organisational Unit)*,  Organisation,) Country

   Data Dependent Defaulting

   There are cases where it would be optimal
   to default according to the data.  For example, in:

   Einar Stefferud, Network Management Associates, CA, US

   It would be useful to default "CA" to type State.  This might be done
   by defaulting all two letter attributes under C=US to type State.

   General Defaulting

   A type may be omitted in cases where it does not follow a default
   schema hierarchy, and then type variants can be explored by
   searching.  Thus a distinguished name could be represented by a
   uniquely matching purported name.  For example,

   James Hacker,
   Basingstoke,
   Widget Inc,
   GB

   Would match the distinguished name:

   CN=James Hacker,
   L=Basingstoke,
   O=Widget Inc,
   C=GB

   Abbreviation

   Some of the more significant components of the DN will be omitted,
   and then defaulted in some way (e.g., relative to a local context).
   For example:

   Steve Kille



<span class="grey">Kille                                                           [Page 6]</span></pre>

   Could be interpreted in the context of an organisational default.

   Local Type Keywords

   Local values can be used to identify types, in addition to the
   keywords defined in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"A String Representation of Distinguished Names"'>5</a>].  For example, "Organisation" may be
   recognised as an alternative to "O".

   Component Omission

   An intermediate component of the name may be omitted.  Typically this
   will be an organisational unit.  For example:

   Steve Kille, University College London, GB

   In some cases, this can be combined with abbreviation.  For example:

   Steve Kille, University College London

   Approximation

   Approximate renditions or alternate values of one or
   more of the components will be supplied.  For example:

   Stephen Kille, CS, UCL, GB

   or

   Steve Keill, Comp Sci, Univarstiy College London, GB

   Friendly Country

   A "friendly country name" can be used instead of the ISO 3166 two
   letter code.  For example:  UK; USA; France; Deutchland.

   A goal of this standard is to provide a means of communicating
   directory names.  Two approaches are given, one defined in [<a href="#ref-5" title='"A String Representation of Distinguished Names"'>5</a>], and
   the other here.  A future version of these specifications may contain
   only one of these approaches, or recommend use of one approach.  The
   approach can usually be distinguished implicitly, as types are
   normally omitted in the UFN approach, and are always present in the
   Distinguished Name approach.  No recommendation is made here, but the
   merits of each approach is given.






<span class="grey">Kille                                                           [Page 7]</span></pre>

   1.  Distinguished Name or DN. A representation of the distinguished
       name, according to the specification of [<a href="#ref-5" title='"A String Representation of Distinguished Names"'>5</a>].

   2.  User Friendly Name or UFN. A purported name, which is expected to
       unambiguously resolve onto the distinguished name.

   When a UFN is communicated, a form which should efficiently and
   unambiguously resolve onto a distinguished name should be chosen.
   Thus it is reasonable to omit types, or to use alternate values which
   will unambiguously identify the entry in question (e.g., by use of an
   alternate value of the RDN attribute type).  It is not reasonable to
   use keys which are (or are likely to become) ambiguous.  The approach
   used should be implicit from the context, rather than wired into the
   syntax.  The terms "Directory Name" and "X.500 Name" should be used
   to refer to a name which might be either a DN or UFN. An example of
   appropriate usage of both forms is given in the Section which defines
   the Author's location in <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>.  Advantages of communicating the
   DN are:

    o  The Distinguished Name is an unambiguous and stable reference to
       the user.

    o  The DN will be used efficiently by the directory to obtain
       information.

   Advantages of communicating the UFN are:

    o  Redundant type information can be omitted (e.g., "California",
       rather than "State=California", where there is known to be no
       ambiguity.

    o  Alternate values can be used to identify a component.  This might
       be used to select a value which is meaningful to the recipient, or
       to use a shorter form of the name.  Often the uniqueness
       requirements of registration will lead to long names, which users
       will wish to avoid.

    o  Levels of the hierarchy may be omitted.  For example in a very
       small organisation, where a level of hierarchy has been used to
       represent company structure, and the person has a unique name
       within the organisation.

   Where UFN form is used, it is important to specify an unambiguous
   form.  In some ways, this is analogous to writing a postal address.
   There are many legal ways to write it.  Care needs to be taken to
   make the address unambiguous.

   The following approach specifies a default algorithm to be used with
   the User Friendly Naming approach.  It is appropriate to modify this
   algorithm, and future specifications may propose alternative
   algorithms.  Two simple algorithms are noted in passing, which may be
   useful in some contexts:

   1.  Use type omission only, but otherwise require the value of the RDN
       attribute to be present.

   2.  Require each RDN to be identified as in 1), or by an exact match
       on an alternate value of the RDN attribute.

   These algorithms do not offer the flexibility of the default
   algorithm proposed, but give many of the benefits of the approach in
   a very simple manner.

   The major utility of the purported name is to provide the important
   "user friendly" characteristic of guessability.  A user will supply a
   purported name to a user interface, and this will be resolved onto a
   distinguished name.  When a user supplies a purported name there is a
   need to derive the DN. In most cases, it should be possible to derive
   a single name from the purported name.  In some cases, ambiguities
   will arise and the user will be prompted to select from a multiple
   matches.  This should also be the case where a component of the name
   did not "match very well".

   There is an assumption that the user will simply enter the name
   correctly.  The purported name variants are designed to make this
   happen!  There is no need for fancy window based interfaces or form
   filling for many applications of the directory.  Note that the fancy
   interfaces still have a role for browsing, and for more complex
   matching.  This type of naming is to deal with cases where
   information on a known user is desired and keyed on the user's name.

   All matches occur in the context of a local environment.  The local
   environment defines a sequence of names of a non-leaf objects in the
   DIT. This environment effectively defines a list of acceptable name
   abbreviations where the DUA is employed.  The environment should be
   controllable by the individual user.  It also defines an order in
   which to operate.

   This list is defined in the context of the number of name components
   supplied.  This allows varying heuristics, depending on the
   environment, to make the approach have the "right" behaviour.  In

   most cases, the environment will start at a local point in the DIT,
   and move upwards.  Examples are given in Tables 1 and 2.  Table 1
   shows an example for a typical local DUA, which has the following
   characteristics:

   One component

   Assumed first to be a user in the department, then a user or
   department within the university, then a national organisation, and
   finally a country.

   Two components

   Most significant component is first assumed to be a national
   organisation, then a department (this might be reversed in some
   organisations), and finally a country.

   Three or more components

   The most significant component is first assumed to be a country, then
   a national organisation, and finally a department.

   A purported name will be supplied, usually with a small number of
   components.  This will be matched in the context of an environment.
   Where there are multiple components to be matched, these should be
   matched sequentially.  If an unambiguous DN is determined, the match
   continues as if the full DN had been supplied.  For example, if

            Table 2:  Local environment for US Public DUA

   Stephen Kille, UCL

   is being matched in the context of environment GB, first UCL is
   resolved to the distinguished name:

   University College London, GB

   Then the next component of the purported name is taken to determine
   the final name.  If there is an ambiguity (e.g., if UCL had made two
   matches, both paths are explored to see if the ambiguity can be
   resolved.  Eventually a set of names will be passed back to the user.

   Each component of the environment is taken in turn.  If the purported
   name has more components than the maximum depth, the environment
   element is skipped.  The advantage of this will be seen in the
   example given later.

   A match of a name is considered to have three levels:

   Exact A DN is specified exactly

   Good Initially, a match should be considered good if it is
       unambiguous, and exactly matches an attribute value in the entry.
       For human names, a looser metric is probably desirable (e.g.,
       S Kille should be a good match of S. Kille, S.E. Kille or Steve
       Kille even if these are not explicit alternate values).

   Poor Any other substring or approximate match

   Following a match, the reference can be followed, or the user
   prompted.  If there are multiple matches, more than one path may be
   followed.  There is also a shift/reduce type of choice:  should any
   partial matches be followed or should the next element of the

   environment be tried.  The following heuristics are suggested, which
   may be modified in the light of experience.  The overall aim is to
   resolve cleanly specified names with a minimum of fuss, but give
   sufficient user control to prevent undue searching and delay.

   1.  Always follow an exact match.

   2.  Follow all good matches if there are no exact matches.

   3.  If there are only poor matches, prompt the user.  If the user
       accepts one or more matches, they can be considered as good.  If
       all are rejected, this can be treated as no matches.

   4.  Automatically move to the next element of the environment if no
       matches are found.

   When the final component is matched, a set of names will be
   identified.  If none are identified, proceed to the next environment
   element.  If the user rejects all of the names, processing of the
   next environment element should be confirmed.

   The exact approach to matching will depend on the level of the tree
   at which matching is being done.  We can now consider how attributes
   are matched at various levels of the DIT.

   There is an issue of approximate matching.  Sometimes it helps, and
   sometimes just returns many spurious matches.  When a search is
   requested, all relevant attributes should be returned, so that
   distinguished and non-distinguished values can be looked at.  This
   will allow a distinction to be made between good and poor matches.
   It is important that where, for example, an acronym exactly matches
   an organisation, that the user is not prompted about other
   organisations where it matches as a substring.

   In this case, a match is being done at the root of the DIT. Three
   approaches are suggested, dependent on the length of supplied name.
   All lead to a single level search of the top level of the DIT.

   Exactly 2

   This is assumed to be a 3166 two letter country code, or an exact
   match on a friendly country or organisation (e.g., UK or UN). Do
   exact match on country and friendly country.

   Greater than 2

   Make an approximate and substring match on friendly country and
   organisation.

   Once the root level has been dealt with, intermediate levels will be
   looking for organisational components (Organisation, Locality, Org
   Unit).  In some cases, private schema control will allow the system
   to determine which is at the next level.  In general this will not be
   possible.  In each case, make a substring and approximate match
   search of one level.  The choice depends on the base object used in
   the search.

   1.  If DN has no Organisation or Locality, filter on Organisation and
       Locality.

   2.  If DN has Org Unit, filter on Org Unit.

   3.  If DN has Organisation, filter on Locality and Org Unit.

   4.  If DN has Locality, filter on Organisation.

   These allow some optimisation, based on legal choices of schema.
   Keeping filters short is usually desirable to improve performance.  A
   few examples of this, where a base object has been determined (either
   by being the environment or by partial resolution of a purported
   name), and the next element of a purported name is being considered.
   This will generate a single level search.  What varies is the types
   being filtered against.  If the DN is:

   University College London, GB

   The search should be for Org Unit or Locality.  If the DN is:

   Organisation=UN

   the search should be for Org Unit or Locality.

   There may be some improvements with respect to very short keys.  Not
   making approximate or substring matches in these cases seems sensible
   (It might be desirable to allow "*" as a part of the purported name
   notation.)

   The "Bottom Level" is to deal with leaf entries in the DIT. This will
   often be a person, but may also be a role, an application entity or
   something else.

   The last component of a purported name may either reference a leaf or
   non-leaf.  For this reason, both should be tested for.  As a
   heuristic, if the base object for the search has two or more
   components it should be tested first as a bottom level name and then
   intermediate.  Reverse this for shorter names.  This optimises for
   the (normal) case of non-leaves high up the tree and leaves low down
   the tree.

   For bottom level names, make an approximate and substring match
   against Common Name, Surname, and User ID. Where common name is
   looked for, a full subtree search will be used when at the second
   level of the DIT or lower, otherwise a single level search.

   For example, if I have resolved a purported name to the distinguished
   name

   University College London, GB

   and have a single component Bloggs, this will generate a subtree
   search.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Examples</span>

   This is all somewhat confusing, and a few examples are given.  These
   are all in the context of the environment shown in Table 1 on Page
   13.

   If "Joe Bloggs" is supplied, a subtree search of

   Physics, University College London, GB

   will be made, and the user prompted for "Joseph Z. Bloggs" as the
   only possible match.

   If "Computer Science" is supplied, first

   Physics, University College London, GB

   will be searched, and the user will reject the approximate match of
   "Colin Skin".  Then a subtree search of

   University College London, GB

   will be made, looking for a person.  Then a single level search will
   be made looking for Org Unit, and

   Computer Science, University College London, GB

   will be returned without prompting (exact match).  Supplying "Steve
   Kille" will lead to a failed subtree search of

   Physics, University College London, GB

   and lead straight to a subtree search of

   University College London, GB

   This will lead to an exact value match, and so a single entry
   returned without prompting.

   If "Andrew Findlay, Brunel" is supplied, the first element of the
   environment will be skipped, single level search of "Brunel" under
   "GB" will find:

   Brunel University, GB

   and a subtree search for "Andrew Findlay" initiated.  This will yield

   Andrew Findlay, Computing and Media Services, Brunel University, GB

   Dr A J Findlay, Manufacturing and Engineering Systems, Brunel
   University, GB

   and the user will be prompted with a choice.

   This approach shows how a simple format of this nature will "do the
   right thing" in many cases.

   The major focus of this work has been to provide a mechanism for
   identifying Organisations and Users.  A related function is to
   identify applications.  Where the Application is identified by an AET
   (Application Entity Title) with an RDN of Common Name, this
   specification leads to a natural usage.  For example, if a filestore
   is named "gannet", then this could easily be identified by the name:



<span class="grey">Kille                                                          [Page 15]</span></pre>

   Gannet, Computer Laboratory, Cambridge University, GB

   In normal usage, this might lead to access (using a purported name)
   of:

   FTAM gannet,cambridge

   A second type of access is where the user identifies an Organisation
   (Organisational Unit), and expects to obtain a default service.  The
   service is implied by the application, and should not require any
   additional naming as far as the user is concerned.  It is proposed
   that this is supported by User Friendly Naming in the following way.

   1.  Determine that the purported name identifies a non-leaf object,
       which is of object class Organisation or Organisational Unit or
       Locality.

   2.  Perform a single level search for Application Entities which
       support the required application contexts.  This assumes that all
       services which are supporting default access for the organisation
       are registered at one level below (possibly by the use of
       aliases), and that other services (specific machines or parts of
       the organisation) are represented further down the tree.  This
       seems to be a reasonable layout, and its utility can be evaluated
       by experiment.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.%20%20Experience"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" name="section-8">8</a>.  Experience</span>

   An experimental implementation of this has been written by Colin
   Robbins.  The example in Figure 1 shows that it can be very effective
   at locating known individuals with a minimum of effort.  This code has
   been deployed within the "FRED" interface of the PSI Pilot [<a href="#ref-9" title="Inc.">9</a>], and
   within an prototype interface for managing distribution lists.  The
   user reaction has been favourable:

   Some issues have arisen from this experience:

    o  Where there is more than one level of Organisational Unit, and the
       user guesses one which is not immediately below the organisation,
       the algorithm works badly.  There does not appear to be an easy
       fix for this.  It is not clear if this is a serious deficiency.

    o  Substring searching is currently done with leading and trailing
       wildcards.  As many implementations will not implement leading
       wildcards efficiently, it may be preferable to only use trailing
       wildcards.  The effect of this on the algorithm needs to be
       investigated.




<span class="grey">Kille                                                          [Page 16]</span></pre>

   Implementors of this specification are encouraged to investigate
   variants of the basic algorithm.  A final specification should depend
   on experience with such variants.

   Colin Robbin's work on the interface "Tom" and implementation of a
   distribution list interface strongly influenced this specification
   [<a href="#ref-6">6</a>].

   Some of the ideas used here originally came from a UK Proposal to the
   ISO/CCITT Directory Group on "New Name Forms" [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>].  This defined, and
   showed how to implement, four different types of names:

   Typed and Ordered The current Distinguished Name is a restricted

              Figure 1:  Example usage of User Friendly Naming

   Untyped and Ordered

   This is the type of name proposed here (with some extensions to allow
   optional typing).  It is seen as meeting the key user requirement of
   disliking typed names, and is efficient to implement.

   Typed and Unordered

   This sort of name is proposed by others as the key basis for user
   friendly naming.  Neufeld shows how X.500 can be used to provide this
   [<a href="#ref-7" title="pages 64-- 71">7</a>], and Peterson proposes the Profile system to provide this [<a href="#ref-8" title="6(4):341--364">8</a>].

   The author contends that whilst typed naming is interesting for some
   types of searching (e.g., yellow page searching), it is less
   desirable for naming objects.  This is borne out by operational
   experience with OSI Directories [<a href="#ref-3" title="16(1):143--145">3</a>].

   Untyped and Unordered

   Surprisingly this form of name can be supported quite easily.
   However, a considerable gain in efficiency can be achieved by
   requiring ordering.  In practice, users can supply this easily.
   Therefore, this type of name is not proposed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.%20%20Issues"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" name="section-10">10</a>.  Issues</span>

   The following issues are noted, which would need to be resolved
   before this document is progressed as an Internet Standard.

   Potential Ambiguity

   Whilst the intention of the notation is to allow for specification of
   alternate values, it inherently allows for ambiguous names to be
   specified.  It needs to be demonstrated that problems of this
   characteristic are outweighed by other benefits of the notation.

   Utility

   Determine that the specification is being implemented and used.

   Performance

   Measurements on the performance implications of using this approach
   should be made.

   Alogrithm

   The utility of the algorithm, and possible variants, should be
   investigated.

   This format, and the procedures for resolving purported names, should
   be evolved to an Internet Standard.  The syntax can be expected to be
   stable.  In light of experience, the algorithm for resolving
   purported names may be changed.
