Abstract

   For historical interest, this document captures the EF Design Team's
   proposed solution, preferred by the original authors of <a href="rfc2598.html">RFC 2598</a> but
   not adopted by the working group in December 2000.  The original
   definition of EF was based on comparison of forwarding on an unloaded
   network.  This experimental Delay Bound (DB) PHB requires a bound on
   the delay of packets due to other traffic in the network.  At the
   Pittsburgh IETF meeting in August 2000, the Differentiated Services
   working group faced serious questions regarding <a href="rfc2598.html">RFC 2598</a> - the
   group's standards track definition of the Expedited Forwarding (EF)
   Per Hop Behavior (PHB).  An 'EF Design Team' volunteered to develop a
   re-expression of <a href="rfc2598.html">RFC 2598</a>, bearing in mind the issues raised in the
   DiffServ group.  At the San Diego IETF meeting in December 2000 the
   DiffServ working group decided to pursue an alternative re-expression
   of the EF PHB.

Specification of Requirements

   This document is for Informational purposes only.  If implementors
   choose to experiment with the DB PHB, key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are interpreted as described in
   <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>3</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a> Introduction</span>

   <a href="rfc2598.html">RFC 2598</a> was the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) working group's
   first standards track definition of the Expedited Forwarding (EF) Per
   Hop Behavior (PHB) [<a href="#ref-1" title='"An Expedited Forwarding PHB"'>1</a>].  As part of the DiffServ working group's
   ongoing refinement of the EF PHB, various issues were raised with the
   text in <a href="rfc2598.html">RFC 2598</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"An Expedited Forwarding PHB (Per-Hop Behavior)"'>2</a>].

   After the Pittsburgh IETF meeting in August 2000, a volunteer 'EF
   design team' was formed (the authors of this document) to propose a
   new expression of the EF PHB.  The remainder of this Informational
   document captures our feedback to the DiffServ working group at the
   San Diego IETF in December 2000.  Our solution focussed on a Delay
   Bound (DB) based re-expression of <a href="rfc2598.html">RFC 2598</a> which met the goals of <a href="rfc2598.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc2598.html">2598</a>'s original authors.  The DiffServ working group ultimately chose
   an alternative re-expression of the EF PHB text, developed by the
   authors of [<a href="#ref-2" title='"An Expedited Forwarding PHB (Per-Hop Behavior)"'>2</a>] and revised to additionally encompass our model
   described here.

   Our proposed Delay Bound solution is archived for historical
   interest.  <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> covers the minimum, necessary and sufficient
   description of what we believed qualifies as 'DB' behavior from a
   single node.  <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> then discusses a number of issues and
   assumptions made to support the definition in <a href="#section-2">section 2</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Definition%20of%20Delay%20Bound%20forwarding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Definition of Delay Bound forwarding</span>

   For a traffic stream not exceeding a particular configured rate, the
   goal of the DB PHB is a strict bound on the delay variation of
   packets through a hop.

   This section will begin with the goals and necessary boundary
   conditions for DB behavior, then provide a descriptive definition of
   DB behavior itself, discuss what it means to conform to the DB
   definition, and assign the experimental DB PHB code point.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1%20Goal%20and%20Scope%20of%20DB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a> Goal and Scope of DB</span>

   For a traffic stream not exceeding a configured rate the goal of the
   DB PHB is a strict bound on the delay variation of packets through a
   hop.

   Traffic MUST be policed and/or shaped at the source edge (for
   example, on ingress to the DS-domain as discussed in <a href="rfc2475.html">RFC 2475</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"An Architecture for Differentiated Services"'>5</a>]) in
   order to get such a bound.  However, specific policing and/or shaping
   rules are outside the scope of the DB PHB definition.  Such rules
   MUST be defined in any per-domain behaviors (PDBs) composed from the
   DB PHB.

   A device (hop) delivers DB behavior to appropriately marked traffic
   received on one or more interfaces (marking is specified in <a href="#section-2.4">section</a>
   <a href="#section-2.4">2.4</a>).  A device SHALL deliver the DB behavior on an interface to DB
   marked traffic meeting (i.e. less than or equal) a certain arrival
   rate limit R.

   If more DB traffic arrives than is acceptable, the device is NOT
   REQUIRED to deliver the DB behavior.  However, although the original
   source of DB traffic will be shaped, aggregation and upstream jitter
   ensure that the traffic arriving at any given hop cannot be assumed
   to be so shaped.  Thus a DB implementation SHOULD have some tolerance
   for burstiness - the ability to provide EF behavior even when the
   arrival rate exceeds the rate limit R.

   Different DB implementations are free to exhibit different tolerance
   to burstiness.  (Burstiness MAY be characterized in terms of the
   number of back-to-back wire-rate packets to which the hop can deliver
   DB behavior.  However, since the goal of characterizing burstiness is
   to allow useful comparison of DB implementations, vendors and users
   of DB implementations MAY choose to utilize other burstiness
   metrics.)

   The DB PHB definition does NOT mandate or recommend any particular
   method for achieving DB behavior.  Rather, the DB PHB definition
   identifies parameters that bound the operating range(s) over which an
   implementation can deliver DB behavior.  Implementors characterize
   their implementations using these parameters, while network designers
   and testers use these parameters to assess the utility of different
   DB implementations.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2%20Description%20of%20DB%20behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a> Description of DB behavior</span>

   For simplicity the definition will be explained using an example
   where traffic arrives on only one interface and is destined for

   The crux of this definition is that the difference in time between
   when a packet might have been delivered, and when it is delivered,
   will never exceed a specifiable bound.

   Given an acceptable (not exceeding arrival rate limit R) stream of DB
   packets arriving on an interface:

      There is a time sequence E(i) when these packets would be
      delivered at the output interface in the absence of competing
      traffic.  That is, E(i) are the earliest times that the packets
      could be delivered by the device.

      In the presence of competing traffic, the packets will be delayed
      to some later time D(i).

   Competing traffic includes all DB traffic arriving at the device on
   other ports, and all non-DB traffic arriving at the device on any
   port.

   DB is defined as the behavior which ensures, for all i, that:

      D(i) - E(i) &lt;=  S * MTU/R.

   MTU is the maximum transmission unit (packet size) of the output.  R
   is the arrival rate that the DB device is prepared to accept on this
   interface.

   Note that D(i) and E(i) simply refer to the times of what can be
   thought of as "the same packet" under the two treatments (with and
   without competing traffic).

   The score, S, is a characteristic of the device at the rate, R, in
   order to meet this defined bound.  This score, preferably a small
   constant, depends on the scheduling mechanism and configuration of
   the device.

   An implementation need not conform to the DB specification over an
   arbitrary range of parameter values.  Instead, implementations MUST
   specify the rates, R, and scores S, for which they claim conformance
   with the DB definition in <a href="#section-2.2">section 2.2</a>, and the implementation-
   specific configuration parameters needed to deliver conformant
   behavior.  An implementation SHOULD document the traffic burstiness
   it can tolerate while still providing DB behavior.

   The score, S, and configuration parameters depend on the
   implementation error from an ideal scheduler.  Discussion of the
   ability of any particular scheduler to provide DB behavior, and the
   conditions under which it might do so, is outside the scope of this
   document.

   The implementor MAY define additional constraints on the range of
   configurations in which DB behavior is delivered.  These constraints
   MAY include limits on the total DB traffic across the device, or
   total DB traffic targeted at a given interface from all inputs.

   This document does not specify any requirements on DB
   implementation's values for R, S, or tolerable burstiness.  These
   parameters will be bounded by real-world considerations such as the
   actual network being designed and the desired PDB.

   The definition of DB behavior given in <a href="#section-2">section 2</a> is quite explicitly
   given in terms of input rate R and output delay variation D(i) -
   E(i).  A scheduler's output rate does not need to be specified, since
   (by design) it will be whatever is needed to achieve the target delay
   variation bounds.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.5%20Jitter"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.5" name="section-3.5">3.5</a> Jitter</span>

   Jitter is not the bounded parameter in DB behavior.  Jitter can be
   understood in a number of ways, for example the variability in
   inter-packet times from one inter-packet interval to the next.
   However, DB behavior aims to bound a related but different parameter
   - the variation in delay between the time packets would depart in the
   absence of competing traffic, E(i), and when they would depart in the
   presence of competing traffic, D(i).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.6%20Multiple%20Inputs%20and%2For%20Multiple%20Outputs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6" name="section-3.6">3.6</a> Multiple Inputs and/or Multiple Outputs</span>

   The definition of 'competing traffic' in <a href="#section-2.2">section 2.2</a> covers both the
   single input/single output case and the more general case where DB
   traffic is converging on a single output port from multiple input
   ports.  When evaluating the ability of an DB device to offer DB
   behavior to traffic arriving on one port, DB traffic arriving on
   other ports is factored in as competing traffic.

   When considering DB traffic from a single input that is leaving via
   multiple ports, it is clear that the behavior is no worse than if all
   of the traffic could be leaving through each one of those ports
   individually (subject to limits on how much is permitted).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.7%20Fragmentation%20and%20Rate"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.7" name="section-3.7">3.7</a> Fragmentation and Rate</span>

   Where an ingress link has an MTU higher than that of an egress link,
   it is conceivable packets may be fragmented as they pass through a
   Diffserv hop.  However, the unpredictability of fragmentation is
   significantly counter to the goal of providing controllable QoS.
   Therefore we assume that fragmentation of DB packets is being avoided
   (either through some form of Path MTU discovery, or configuration),
   and does not need to be specifically considered in the DB behavior
   definition.

   If the DB PHB is implemented by a mechanism that allows unlimited
   preemption of other traffic (e.g., a priority queue), the
   implementation MUST include some means to limit the damage DB traffic
   could inflict on other traffic.  This will be reflected in the DB
   device's burst tolerance described in <a href="#section-2.1">section 2.1</a>.

   Some DB implementations may choose to provide queuing and scheduling
   at a finer granularity, (for example, per micro flow), than is
   indicated solely by the packet's DSCP.  Such behavior is NOT
   precluded by the DB PHB definition.  However, such behavior is also
   NOT part of the DB PHB definition.  Implementors are free to
   characterize and publicize the additional per micro flow capabilities
   of their DB implementations as they see fit.

   In the absence of additional information, R is assumed to be limited
   by the slowest interface on the device.

   In addition, an DB device may be characterized by different values of
   R for different traffic flow scenarios (for example, for traffic
   aimed at different ports, total incoming R, and possibly total per
   output port incoming R across all incoming interfaces).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20IANA%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>. IANA Considerations</span>

   This document suggests one experimental codepoint, 101111.  Because
   the DSCP is taken from the experimental code space, it may be re-used
   by other experimental or informational DiffServ proposals.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20Conclusion."></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>. Conclusion.</span>

   This document defines DB behavior in terms of a bound on delay
   variation for traffic streams that are rate shaped on ingress to a DS
   domain.  Two parameters - capped arrival rate (R) and a 'score' (S),
   are defined and related to the target delay variation bound.  All
   claims of DB 'conformance' for specific implementations of DB
   behavior are made with respect to particular values for R, S, and the
   implementation's ability to tolerate small amounts of burstiness in
   the arriving DB traffic stream.

Security Considerations

   To protect itself against denial of service attacks, the edge of a DS
   domain MUST strictly police all DB marked packets to a rate
   negotiated with the adjacent upstream domain (for example, some value
   less than or equal to the capped arrival rate R).  Packets in excess
   of the negotiated rate MUST be dropped.  If two adjacent domains have
   not negotiated an DB rate, the downstream domain MUST use 0 as the
   rate (i.e., drop all DB marked packets).

   Since PDBs constructed from the DB PHB will require that the upstream
   domain police and shape DB marked traffic to meet the rate negotiated
   with the downstream domain, the downstream domain's policer should
   never have to drop packets.  Thus these drops (or a summary of these
   drops) SHOULD be noted (e.g., via rate-limited SNMP traps) as
   possible security violations or serious misconfiguration.

   Overflow events on an DB queue MAY also be logged as indicating
   possible denial of service attacks or serious network
   misconfiguration.
