Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize
   the negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart.  An End-of-RIB
   marker is specified and can be used to convey routing convergence
   information.  A new BGP capability, termed "Graceful Restart
   Capability", is defined that would allow a BGP speaker to express its
   ability to preserve forwarding state during BGP restart.  Finally,
   procedures are outlined for temporarily retaining routing information
   across a TCP session termination/re-establishment.

   The mechanisms described in this document are applicable to all
   routers, both those with the ability to preserve forwarding state
   during BGP restart and those without (although the latter need to
   implement only a subset of the mechanisms described in this
   document).

   Usually, when BGP on a router restarts, all the BGP peers detect that
   the session went down and then came up.  This "down/up" transition
   results in a "routing flap" and causes BGP route re-computation,
   generation of BGP routing updates, and unnecessary churn to the
   forwarding tables.  It could spread across multiple routing domains.
   Such routing flaps may create transient forwarding blackholes and/or
   transient forwarding loops.  They also consume resources on the
   control plane of the routers affected by the flap.  As such, they are
   detrimental to the overall network performance.

   This document describes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize
   the negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart.  An End-of-RIB
   marker is specified and can be used to convey routing convergence
   information.  A new BGP capability, termed "Graceful Restart
   Capability", is defined that would allow a BGP speaker to express its
   ability to preserve forwarding state during BGP restart.  Finally,
   procedures are outlined for temporarily retaining routing information
   across a TCP session termination/re-establishment.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Marker%20for%20End-of-RIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Marker for End-of-RIB</span>

   An UPDATE message with no reachable Network Layer Reachability
   Information (NLRI) and empty withdrawn NLRI is specified as the End-
   of-RIB marker that can be used by a BGP speaker to indicate to its
   peer the completion of the initial routing update after the session
   is established.  For the IPv4 unicast address family, the End-of-RIB
   marker is an UPDATE message with the minimum length [<a href="#ref-BGP-4" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP-4</a>].  For any
   other address family, it is an UPDATE message that contains only the
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI attribute [<a href="#ref-BGP-MP" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>BGP-MP</a>] with no withdrawn routes for that
   &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt;.

   Although the End-of-RIB marker is specified for the purpose of BGP
   graceful restart, it is noted that the generation of such a marker
   upon completion of the initial update would be useful for routing
   convergence in general, and thus the practice is recommended.

   In addition, it would be beneficial for routing convergence if a BGP
   speaker can indicate to its peer up-front that it will generate the
   End-of-RIB marker, regardless of its ability to preserve its
   forwarding state during BGP restart.  This can be accomplished using
   the Graceful Restart Capability described in the next section.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Graceful%20Restart%20Capability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Graceful Restart Capability</span>

   The Graceful Restart Capability is a new BGP capability [<a href="#ref-BGP-CAP" title='"Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4"'>BGP-CAP</a>]
   that can be used by a BGP speaker to indicate its ability to preserve
   its forwarding state during BGP restart.  It can also be used to
   convey to its peer its intention of generating the End-of-RIB marker
   upon the completion of its initial routing updates.

   This capability is defined as follows:

      Capability code: 64

      Capability length: variable

      Capability value: Consists of the "Restart Flags" field, "Restart
      Time" field, and 0 to 63 of the tuples &lt;AFI, SAFI, Flags for
      address family&gt; as follows:

   The use and meaning of the fields are as follows:

      Restart Flags:

         This field contains bit flags related to restart.

             0 1 2 3
            +-+-+-+-+
            |R|Resv.|
            +-+-+-+-+

         The most significant bit is defined as the Restart State (R)
         bit, which can be used to avoid possible deadlock caused by
         waiting for the End-of-RIB marker when multiple BGP speakers
         peering with each other restart.  When set (value 1), this bit
         indicates that the BGP speaker has restarted, and its peer MUST
         NOT wait for the End-of-RIB marker from the speaker before
         advertising routing information to the speaker.

         The remaining bits are reserved and MUST be set to zero by the
         sender and ignored by the receiver.

      Restart Time:

         This is the estimated time (in seconds) it will take for the
         BGP session to be re-established after a restart.  This can be
         used to speed up routing convergence by its peer in case that
         the BGP speaker does not come back after a restart.

      Address Family Identifier (AFI), Subsequent Address Family
         Identifier (SAFI):

         The AFI and SAFI, taken in combination, indicate that Graceful
         Restart is supported for routes that are advertised with the
         same AFI and SAFI.  Routes may be explicitly associated with a
         particular AFI and SAFI using the encoding of [<a href="#ref-BGP-MP" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>BGP-MP</a>] or
         implicitly associated with &lt;AFI=IPv4, SAFI=Unicast&gt; if using
         the encoding of [<a href="#ref-BGP-4" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP-4</a>].

      Flags for Address Family:

         This field contains bit flags relating to routes that were
         advertised with the given AFI and SAFI.

             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |F|   Reserved  |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         The most significant bit is defined as the Forwarding State (F)
         bit, which can be used to indicate whether the forwarding state
         for routes that were advertised with the given AFI and SAFI has
         indeed been preserved during the previous BGP restart.  When
         set (value 1), the bit indicates that the forwarding state has
         been preserved.

         The remaining bits are reserved and MUST be set to zero by the
         sender and ignored by the receiver.

   When a sender of this capability does not include any &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt; in
   the capability, it means that the sender is not capable of preserving
   its forwarding state during BGP restart, but supports procedures for
   the Receiving Speaker (as defined in <a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a> of this document).
   In that case, the value of the "Restart Time" field advertised by the
   sender is irrelevant.

   A BGP speaker MUST NOT include more than one instance of the Graceful
   Restart Capability in the capability advertisement [<a href="#ref-BGP-CAP" title='"Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4"'>BGP-CAP</a>].  If
   more than one instance of the Graceful Restart Capability is carried
   in the capability advertisement, the receiver of the advertisement
   MUST ignore all but the last instance of the Graceful Restart
   Capability.

   Including &lt;AFI=IPv4, SAFI=unicast&gt; in the Graceful Restart Capability
   does not imply that the IPv4 unicast routing information should be
   carried by using the BGP multiprotocol extensions [<a href="#ref-BGP-MP" title='"Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4"'>BGP-MP</a>] -- it
   could be carried in the NLRI field of the BGP UPDATE message.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Operation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Operation</span>

   A BGP speaker MAY advertise the Graceful Restart Capability for an
   address family to its peer if it has the ability to preserve its
   forwarding state for the address family when BGP restarts.  In
   addition, even if the speaker does not have the ability to preserve
   its forwarding state for any address family during BGP restart, it is
   still recommended that the speaker advertise the Graceful Restart
   Capability to its peer (as mentioned before this is done by not
   including any &lt;AFI, SAFI&gt; in the advertised capability).  There are
   two reasons for doing this.  The first is to indicate its intention
   of generating the End-of-RIB marker upon the completion of its
   initial routing updates, as doing this would be useful for routing
   convergence in general.  The second is to indicate its support for a
   peer which wishes to perform a graceful restart.

   The End-of-RIB marker MUST be sent by a BGP speaker to its peer once
   it completes the initial routing update (including the case when
   there is no update to send) for an address family after the BGP
   session is established.

   It is noted that the normal BGP procedures MUST be followed when the
   TCP session terminates due to the sending or receiving of a BGP
   NOTIFICATION message.

   A suggested default for the Restart Time is a value less than or
   equal to the HOLDTIME carried in the OPEN.

   In the following sections, "Restarting Speaker" refers to a router
   whose BGP has restarted, and "Receiving Speaker" refers to a router
   that peers with the restarting speaker.

   Consider that the Graceful Restart Capability for an address family
   is advertised by the Restarting Speaker, and is understood by the
   Receiving Speaker, and a BGP session between them is established.
   The following sections detail the procedures that MUST be followed by
   the Restarting Speaker as well as the Receiving Speaker once the
   Restarting Speaker restarts.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Procedures%20for%20the%20Restarting%20Speaker"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Procedures for the Restarting Speaker</span>

   When the Restarting Speaker restarts, it MUST retain, if possible,
   the forwarding state for the BGP routes in the Loc-RIB and MUST mark
   them as stale.  It MUST NOT differentiate between stale and other
   information during forwarding.

   To re-establish the session with its peer, the Restarting Speaker
   MUST set the "Restart State" bit in the Graceful Restart Capability



<span class="grey">Sangli, et al.              Standards Track                     [Page 6]</span></pre>

   of the OPEN message.  Unless allowed via configuration, the
   "Forwarding State" bit for an address family in the capability can be
   set only if the forwarding state has indeed been preserved for that
   address family during the restart.

   Once the session between the Restarting Speaker and the Receiving
   Speaker is re-established, the Restarting Speaker will receive and
   process BGP messages from its peers.  However, it MUST defer route
   selection for an address family until it either (a) receives the
   End-of-RIB marker from all its peers (excluding the ones with the
   "Restart State" bit set in the received capability and excluding the
   ones that do not advertise the graceful restart capability) or (b)
   the Selection_Deferral_Timer referred to below has expired.  It is
   noted that prior to route selection, the speaker has no routes to
   advertise to its peers and no routes to update the forwarding state.

   In situations where both Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) and BGP have
   restarted, it might be advantageous to wait for IGP to converge
   before the BGP speaker performs route selection.

   After the BGP speaker performs route selection, the forwarding state
   of the speaker MUST be updated and any previously marked stale
   information MUST be removed.  The Adj-RIB-Out can then be advertised
   to its peers.  Once the initial update is complete for an address
   family (including the case that there is no routing update to send),
   the End-of-RIB marker MUST be sent.

   To put an upper bound on the amount of time a router defers its route
   selection, an implementation MUST support a (configurable) timer that
   imposes this upper bound.  This timer is referred to as the
   "Selection_Deferral_Timer".  The value of this timer should be large
   enough, so as to provide all the peers of the Restarting Speaker with
   enough time to send all the routes to the Restarting Speaker.

   If one wants to apply graceful restart only when the restart is
   planned (as opposed to both planned and unplanned restart), then one
   way to accomplish this would be to set the Forwarding State bit to 1
   after a planned restart, and to 0 in all other cases.  Other
   approaches to accomplish this are outside the scope of this document.

   When the Restarting Speaker restarts, the Receiving Speaker may or
   may not detect the termination of the TCP session with the Restarting
   Speaker, depending on the underlying TCP implementation, whether or
   not [<a href="#ref-BGP-AUTH" title='"Protection of BGP Sessions via the TCP MD5 Signature Option"'>BGP-AUTH</a>] is in use, and the specific circumstances of the
   restart.  In case it does not detect the termination of the old TCP
   session and still considers the BGP session as being established, it

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4724.html">RFC 4724</a>           Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP       January 2007</span>


   MUST treat the subsequent open connection from the peer as an
   indication of the termination of the old TCP session and act
   accordingly (when the Graceful Restart Capability has been received
   from the peer).  See <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> for a description of this behavior in
   terms of the BGP finite state machine.

   "Acting accordingly" in this context means that the previous TCP
   session MUST be closed, and the new one retained.  Note that this
   behavior differs from the default behavior, as specified in [<a href="#ref-BGP-4" title='"A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)"'>BGP-4</a>],
   Section 6.8.  Since the previous connection is considered to be
   terminated, no NOTIFICATION message should be sent -- the previous
   TCP session is simply closed.

   When the Receiving Speaker detects termination of the TCP session for
   a BGP session with a peer that has advertised the Graceful Restart
   Capability, it MUST retain the routes received from the peer for all
   the address families that were previously received in the Graceful
   Restart Capability and MUST mark them as stale routing information.
   To deal with possible consecutive restarts, a route (from the peer)
   previously marked as stale MUST be deleted.  The router MUST NOT
   differentiate between stale and other routing information during
   forwarding.

   In re-establishing the session, the "Restart State" bit in the
   Graceful Restart Capability of the OPEN message sent by the Receiving
   Speaker MUST NOT be set unless the Receiving Speaker has restarted.
   The presence and the setting of the "Forwarding State" bit for an
   address family depend upon the actual forwarding state and
   configuration.

   If the session does not get re-established within the "Restart Time"
   that the peer advertised previously, the Receiving Speaker MUST
   delete all the stale routes from the peer that it is retaining.

   A BGP speaker could have some way of determining whether its peer's
   forwarding state is still viable, for example through Bidirectional
   Forwarding Detection [<a href="#ref-BFD" title='"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection"'>BFD</a>] or through monitoring layer two
   information.  Specifics of such mechanisms are beyond the scope of
   this document.  In the event that it determines that its peer's
   forwarding state is not viable prior to the re-establishment of the
   session, the speaker MAY delete all the stale routes from the peer
   that it is retaining.

   Once the session is re-established, if the "Forwarding State" bit for
   a specific address family is not set in the newly received Graceful
   Restart Capability, or if a specific address family is not included
   in the newly received Graceful Restart Capability, or if the Graceful
   Restart Capability is not received in the re-established session at

   all, then the Receiving Speaker MUST immediately remove all the stale
   routes from the peer that it is retaining for that address family.

   The Receiving Speaker MUST send the End-of-RIB marker once it
   completes the initial update for an address family (including the
   case that it has no routes to send) to the peer.

   The Receiving Speaker MUST replace the stale routes by the routing
   updates received from the peer.  Once the End-of-RIB marker for an
   address family is received from the peer, it MUST immediately remove
   any routes from the peer that are still marked as stale for that
   address family.

   To put an upper bound on the amount of time a router retains the
   stale routes, an implementation MAY support a (configurable) timer
   that imposes this upper bound.

   Although the procedures described in this document would help
   minimize the effect of routing flaps, it is noted that when a BGP
   Graceful Restart-capable router restarts, or if it restarts without
   preserving its forwarding state (e.g., due to a power failure), there
   is a potential for transient routing loops or blackholes in the
   network if routing information changes before the involved routers
   complete routing updates and convergence.  Also, depending on the

   network topology, if not all IBGP speakers are Graceful Restart
   capable, there could be an increased exposure to transient routing
   loops or blackholes when the Graceful Restart procedures are
   exercised.

   The Restart Time, the upper bound for retaining routes, and the upper
   bound for deferring route selection may need to be tuned as more
   deployment experience is gained.

   Finally, it is noted that the benefits of deploying BGP Graceful
   Restart in an Autonomous System (AS) whose IGPs and BGP are tightly
   coupled (i.e., BGP and IGPs would both restart) and IGPs have no
   similar Graceful Restart Capability are reduced relative to the
   scenario where IGPs do have similar Graceful Restart Capability.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Since with this proposal a new connection can cause an old one to be
   terminated, it might seem to open the door to denial of service
   attacks.  However, it is noted that unauthenticated BGP is already
   known to be vulnerable to denials of service through attacks on the
   TCP transport.  The TCP transport is commonly protected through use
   of [<a href="#ref-BGP-AUTH" title='"Protection of BGP Sessions via the TCP MD5 Signature Option"'>BGP-AUTH</a>].  Such authentication will equally protect against
   denials of service through spurious new connections.

   If an attacker is able to successfully open a TCP connection
   impersonating a legitimate peer, the attacker's connection will
   replace the legitimate one, potentially enabling the attacker to
   advertise bogus routes.  We note, however, that the window for such a
   route insertion attack is small since through normal operation of the
   protocol the legitimate peer would open a new connection, in turn
   causing the attacker's connection to be terminated.  Thus, this
   attack devolves to a form of denial of service.

   It is thus concluded that this proposal does not change the
   underlying security model (and issues) of BGP-4.

   We also note that implementations may allow use of graceful restart
   to be controlled by configuration.  If graceful restart is not
   enabled, naturally the underlying security model of BGP-4 is
   unchanged.
