Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) Extensions for TCP Allocations

Abstract

   This specification defines an extension of Traversal Using Relays
   around NAT (TURN), a relay protocol for Network Address Translator
   (NAT) traversal.  This extension allows a TURN client to request TCP
   allocations, and defines new requests and indications for the TURN
   server to open and accept TCP connections with the client's peers.
   TURN and this extension both purposefully restrict the ways in which
   the relayed address can be used.  In particular, it prevents users
   from running general-purpose servers from ports obtained from the
   TURN server.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) [<a href="rfc5766.html" title='"Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)"'>RFC5766</a>] is an extension to
   the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT [<a href="rfc5389.html" title='"Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)"'>RFC5389</a>] protocol.  TURN
   allows for clients to communicate with a TURN server and ask it to
   allocate ports on one of its host interfaces, and then relay traffic
   between that port and the client itself.  TURN, when used in concert
   with STUN and Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [<a href="rfc5245.html" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>RFC5245</a>],
   forms a solution for NAT traversal for UDP-based media sessions.

   However, TURN itself does not provide a way for a client to allocate
   a TCP-based port on a TURN server.  Such an allocation is needed for
   cases where a TCP-based session is desired with a peer, and NATs
   prevent a direct TCP connection.  Examples include application
   sharing between desktop softphones, or transmission of pictures
   during a voice communications session.

   This document defines an extension to TURN that allows a client to
   obtain a TCP allocation.  It also allows the client to initiate
   outgoing TCP connections from that allocation to peers and to accept
   incoming TCP connection requests from peers made towards that
   allocation.

   The term "TCP allocation" means a TURN allocation where TCP is used
   as the transport protocol instead of UDP.  Such an allocation is
   uniquely identified by its relayed transport address, which consists
   of an IP address and TCP port (defined in [<a href="rfc5766.html" title='"Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)"'>RFC5766</a>]).

                         Figure 1: TURN TCP Model

   The overall model for TURN-TCP is shown in Figure 1.  The client will
   have two different types of connections to its TURN server.  For each
   allocated relayed transport address, it will have a single control
   connection.  Control connections are used to obtain allocations and
   open up new connections.  Furthermore, for each connection to a peer,
   the client will have a single connection to its TURN server.  These
   connections are called data connections.  Consequently, there is a
   data connection from the client to its TURN server (the client data
   connection) and one from the TURN server to a peer (the peer data
   connection).  Actual application data is sent on these connections.
   Indeed, after an initial TURN message that binds the client data
   connection to a peer data connection, only application data can be
   sent -- no TURN messaging.  This is in contrast to the control
   connection, which only allows TURN messages and not application data.

   To obtain a TCP-based allocation, a client first opens a TCP or TLS
   connection to its TURN server.  The client then sends an Allocate
   request over that control connection.  That request contains a
   REQUESTED-TRANSPORT attribute, which indicates a TCP-based allocation

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6062.html">RFC 6062</a>                        TURN TCP                   November 2010</span>


   is desired.  A server that supports this extension will allocate a
   TCP relayed transport address and begin listening for connection
   requests on it.  It then returns the allocated relayed transport
   address to the client in the response to the Allocate request.  The
   connection on which the Allocate request was sent is the control
   connection.

   If a client wishes to establish a TCP connection to a peer from that
   relayed transport address, it issues a Connect request to the TURN
   server over the control connection.  That request contains an XOR-
   PEER-ADDRESS attribute identifying the peer IP address and port
   (i.e., its "transport address") to which a connection is to be made.
   The TURN server attempts to open the TCP connection, and assuming it
   succeeds, then responds to the Connect request with a success
   response.  The server also creates a connection identifier associated
   with this connection and passes that connection identifier back to
   the client in the success response.  Note that a maximum of one
   connection to a given peer transport address can be established per
   allocation.

      Note: Establishing a relayed connection from the client to a peer
      is done in two steps.  First, the allocation is created, and
      second, the connection is established.  Combining the two is not
      desirable for NAT traversal.  It is expected that, between the
      first and second steps, the client will communicate off-band with
      the peer (e.g., using ICE [<a href="rfc5245.html" title='"Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"'>RFC5245</a>]) and tell it the relayed
      transport address that the TURN server allocated and from which it
      is about to initiate a connection.  The peer can then "get ready":
      open holes in its firewall, try to poke holes in a NAT, attempt a
      TCP simultaneous open, etc.

   In order to actually send data on the new connection or otherwise
   utilize it in any way, the client establishes a new TCP connection to
   its TURN server.  Once established, it issues a ConnectionBind
   request to the server over this new connection.  That request echoes
   back the connection identifier to the TURN server.  The TURN server
   uses it to correlate the two connections.  As a consequence, the TCP
   connection to the peer is associated with a TCP connection to the
   client one-to-one.  The two connections are now data connections.  At
   this point, if the server receives data from the peer, it forwards
   that data towards the client, without any kind of encapsulation.  Any
   data received by the TURN server from the client over the client data
   connection is forwarded to the peer, again without encapsulation or
   framing of any kind.  Once a connection has been bound using the
   ConnectionBind request, TURN messaging is no longer permitted on the
   connection.

   In a similar way, when a peer opens a TCP connection towards the
   relayed transport address, the server checks if there is a permission
   in place for that peer.  If there is none, the connection is closed.
   Permissions are created with the CreatePermission request sent over
   the control connection, just as for UDP TURN.  If there is a
   permission in place, the TURN server sends to the client a
   ConnectionAttempt Indication over the control connection.  That
   indication contains a connection identifier.  Once again, the client
   initiates a separate TCP connection to its TURN server, and over that
   connection, issues a ConnectionBind request.  Once received, the TURN
   server will begin relaying data back and forth.  The server closes
   the peer data connection if no ConnectionBind request is received
   after a timeout.

   If the client closes a client data connection, the corresponding peer
   data connection is closed.  If the peer closes a peer data
   connection, the corresponding client data connection is closed.  In
   this way, the status of the connection is directly known to the
   client.

   The TURN server will relay the data between the client and peer data
   connections.  End-to-end flow control is maintained by the relay
   process: if the relay process is no longer able to write data to the
   destination of the relayed data, the relay process stops reading data
   from the source.

   To create a TCP allocation, a client MUST initiate a new TCP or TLS
   connection to its TURN server, identical to the TCP or TLS procedures
   defined in [<a href="rfc5766.html" title='"Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)"'>RFC5766</a>].  TCP allocations cannot be obtained using a UDP
   association between client and server.

   Once set up, a client MUST send a TURN Allocate request.  That
   request MUST contain a REQUESTED-TRANSPORT attribute whose value is
   6, corresponding to TCP.

   The request MUST NOT include a DONT-FRAGMENT, RESERVATION-TOKEN, or
   EVEN-PORT attribute.  The corresponding features are specific to UDP-
   based capabilities and are not utilized by TURN-TCP.  However, a
   LIFETIME attribute MAY be included, with semantics identical to the
   UDP case.

   The procedures for authentication of the Allocate request and
   processing of success and failure responses are identical to those
   for UDP.

   Once a success response is received, the TCP connection to the TURN
   server is called the control connection for that allocation.

   The procedures for refreshing an allocation are identical to those
   for UDP.  Note that the Refresh MUST be sent on the control
   connection.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20Initiating%20a%20Connection"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Initiating a Connection</span>

   To initiate a TCP connection to a peer, a client MUST send a Connect
   request over the control connection for the desired allocation.  The
   Connect request MUST include an XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attribute containing
   the transport address of the peer to which a connection is desired.

   If the connection is successfully established, the client will
   receive a success response.  That response will contain a
   CONNECTION-ID attribute.  The client MUST initiate a new TCP
   connection to the server, utilizing the same destination transport
   address to which the control connection was established.  This
   connection MUST be made using a different local transport address.
   Authentication of the client by the server MUST use the same method
   and credentials as for the control connection.  Once established, the
   client MUST send a ConnectionBind request over the new connection.
   That request MUST include the CONNECTION-ID attribute, echoed from
   the Connect Success response.  When a response to the ConnectionBind
   request is received, if it is a success, the TCP connection on which
   it was sent is called the client data connection corresponding to the
   peer.

   If the result of the Connect request was an Error Response, and the
   response code was 447 (Connection Timeout or Failure), it means that
   the TURN server was unable to connect to the peer.  The client MAY
   retry with the same XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attribute, but MUST wait at
   least 10 seconds.

   As with any other request, multiple Connect requests MAY be sent
   simultaneously.  However, Connect requests with the same XOR-PEER-
   ADDRESS parameter MUST NOT be sent simultaneously.

   After an Allocate request is successfully processed by the server,
   the client will start receiving a ConnectionAttempt indication each
   time a peer for which a permission has been installed attempts a new
   connection to the relayed transport address.  This indication will
   contain CONNECTION-ID and XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attributes.  If the client

   wishes to accept this connection, it MUST initiate a new TCP
   connection to the server, utilizing the same destination transport
   address to which the control connection was established.  This
   connection MUST be made using a different local transport address.
   Authentication of the client by the server MUST use the same method
   and credentials as for the control connection.  Once established, the
   client MUST send a ConnectionBind request over the new connection.
   That request MUST include the CONNECTION-ID attribute, echoed from
   the ConnectionAttempt indication.  When a response to the
   ConnectionBind request is received, if it is a success, the TCP
   connection on which it was sent is called the client data connection
   corresponding to the peer.

   Once a client data connection is established, data sent on it by the
   client will be relayed as-is to the peer by the server.  Similarly,
   data sent by the peer to the server will be relayed as-is to the
   client over the data connection.

   The client MUST refresh the allocation (corresponding to a data
   connection) using the Refresh request as defined in [<a href="rfc5766.html" title='"Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)"'>RFC5766</a>] for as
   long as it wants to keep the data connection alive.

   When the client wishes to terminate its relayed connection to the
   peer, it closes the data connection to the server.

      Note: No mechanism for keeping alive the NAT bindings (potentially
      on the client data connection as well as on the peer data
      connection) is included.  This service is not provided by TURN-
      TCP.  If such a feature is deemed necessary, it can be implemented
      higher up the stack, in the application protocol being tunneled
      inside TURN-TCP.  Also, TCP keep-alives MAY be used to keep the
      NAT bindings on the client data connection alive.

   4.  A TCP relayed transport address MUST be allocated instead of a

   5.  The RESERVATION-TOKEN attribute MUST NOT be present in the

   When the server receives a Connect request, it processes the request
   as follows.

   If the request is received on a TCP connection for which no
   allocation exists, the server MUST return a 437 (Allocation Mismatch)
   error.

   If the server is currently processing a Connect request for this

   If the server has already successfully processed a Connect request
   for this allocation with the same XOR-PEER-ADDRESS, and the resulting
   client and peer data connections are either pending or active, it
   MUST return a 446 (Connection Already Exists) error.

   If the request does not contain an XOR-PEER-ADDRESS attribute, or if
   such attribute is invalid, the server MUST return a 400 (Bad Request)
   error.

   If the new connection is forbidden by local policy, the server MUST
   reject the request with a 403 (Forbidden) error.

   Otherwise, the server MUST initiate an outgoing TCP connection.  The
   local endpoint is the relayed transport address associated with the
   allocation.  The remote endpoint is the one indicated by the XOR-

   If the connection is successful, it is now called a peer data

   reflect the amount of empty buffer space.

   The server MUST include the CONNECTION-ID attribute in the Connect

   If no ConnectionBind request associated with this peer data

   This specification defines several new STUN methods, STUN attributes,
   and STUN error codes.  IANA added these new protocol elements to the
   Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) Parameters registry.

   This section lists the codepoints for the new STUN methods defined in
   this specification.  See Sections <a href="#section-4">4</a> and <a href="#section-5">5</a> for the semantics of these
   new methods.

   This STUN extension defines the following new attributes:

   0x002a :  CONNECTION-ID

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.2.1.%20%20CONNECTION-ID"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2.1" name="section-6.2.1">6.2.1</a>.  CONNECTION-ID</span>

   The CONNECTION-ID attribute uniquely identifies a peer data
   connection.  It is a 32-bit unsigned integral value.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.3.%20%20New%20STUN%20Error%20Codes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3" name="section-6.3">6.3</a>.  New STUN Error Codes</span>

   446    Connection Already Exists
   447    Connection Timeout or Failure

   After a TCP connection is established between the server and a peer,
   and before a ConnectionBind request is received from the client, the
   server buffers all data received from the peer.  This protocol
   specification lets the server drop the connection if the buffer size
   is about to exceed a limit defined by local policy.  This policy
   should ensure that memory resources are not exceeded.  See also
   <a href="rfc4732.html#section-2.1.3">[RFC4732], Section 2.1.3</a>.

   All the security considerations applicable to STUN [<a href="rfc5389.html" title='"Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)"'>RFC5389</a>] and TURN
   [<a href="rfc5766.html" title='"Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)"'>RFC5766</a>] are applicable to this document as well.
