STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This RFC consolidates information necessary for the implementation of
   domain style names throughout the DDN/MILNET Internet community.
   Although no official policy has been published, the introduction of
   domain style names will impact all hosts in the DDN/MILNET Internet.
   The RFC is designed as an aid to implementors and administrators by
   providing 1) an overview of the transition process from host tables
   to domains, 2) a potential timetable for the transition, and 3)
   references to documentation and software relating to the DDN/ARPANET
   domain system.  Distribution of this RFC is unlimited.

BACKGROUND

   All MILNET hosts are expected to have a way of translating the name
   of any other host into its Internet address.  Although the current
   method of name resolution is to look up the information in a table of
   all hosts, this method of operation is cumbersome and relies on a
   central point of information.  The Network Information Center (NIC)
   maintains a table of hosts registered in the MILNET Internet and
   their addresses.  The size of this table and the frequency of updates
   has reached the limits of manageability.  The central host table is
   FTP'd by a host on a timely basis from the NIC, processed locally (to
   pare or reformat the table), and used in name resolution.

   The domain system uses a distributed database and software to perform
   the same functions as the host table.  In this system, host resolvers
   query domain servers for name resolution.  They may cache answers for
   performance improvement.  The domain servers each maintain a portion
   of the hierarchical database under separate administrative authority
   and control.  Redundancy is obtained by transferring data between
   cooperating servers.

   The domain system has been operating successfully on the ARPANET for
   over a year.  One indication of success is that the NIC's central
   host table is no longer a complete list (i.e., ARPANET does not
   depend primarily on the host table).  The domain system is being
   implemented on the MILNET with DoD military standard protocols.  The
   first step in changing to the domain system has been taken, as
   required by DDN Management Bulletin #32 (22 Jan 1987).  All host

   names were converted from a simple, flat namespace to a structured
   name consistent with domains.  In the second step, servers acting as
   the root of the database hierarchy were put in place.  In the next
   step, hosts are moving away from host table usage.

MIGRATION PATH

   All hosts will not change from host table to domain server usage at
   one time.  Accordingly, three stages of conversion to the domain
   system are envisaged.  These stages roughly correspond to 1)
   continuing to use the host table for all applications, 2) using the
   domain system for only some applications, and 3) using the domain
   system for all applications.  These stages will exist simultaneously
   as various hosts convert their application software according to
   available resources.  The following paragraphs discuss these stages
   in more detail.

   Host Table Only

      In the first stage, a host depends entirely on the host table for
      name resolution.  The table is obtained from the NIC's central
      copy and the resolution is done by local table scanning.  Most
      hosts are in this stage.

      Certain hosts may find it infeasible ever to convert to the domain
      system, owing to older architectures, unchangeable software, or
      other considerations.  At the end of the conversion period, the
      NIC will stop maintaining an internet host table.  To continue
      operations, hosts that do not convert will need to obtain an
      equivalent of the host table from some source.  This source may be
      another host with which a bilateral agreement has been negotiated
      offline, a community-of-interest host acting as central repository
      for that community, or a locally-maintained table of host names
      and addresses.  Transfer of the table from the source is a matter
      of local implementation and bilateral agreements.

   Domain System and Host Table

      In the second stage, a host will use both the host table and the
      domain system.  A likely scenario is that applications like TELNET
      and FTP will use the domain system and that MAIL will continue to
      use the host table for name resolution.  An alternate scenario is
      that batchstyle applications like MAIL would use the domain system
      and that the interactive applications would convert later.

      This stage is viewed as transitory, as hosts convert over to use
      the domain system exclusively.  It is highlighted as a separate
      stage to emphasize the need during transition for both the host

      table and the domain system.

   Domain System Only

      In the third and final stage, a host will have completed
      conversion and will be using the domain system exclusively.  This
      includes correct processing of the mailbox and mail exchanger
      resource records.

MIGRATION TIMETABLE

   Table 1 shows the events and dates involved in the MILNET transition
   from host table to domain system.  The operational testing of the
   root server software has been completed.  Voluntary conversion can
   begin immediately, with mandatory conversion required by October
   1989.  After this date, hosts not converted need to obtain the host
   table equivalent by private arrangement (see "Migration Path" above).

DOCUMENTATION

   The Name Domain system is described in several documents that are
   maintained and available from the NIC in both online and in hardcopy
   form.  The documents are in "Request For Comments" format (RFC)
   commonly used in the Internet to document and discuss various
   networking issues.  The documents noted in Table 2 fully describe the
   concepts, conventions, enhancements, requirements, and operation of
   the Name Domain system.  The following paragraphs give a brief
   synopsis of each document.

      <a href="rfc952.html">952</a> and is used by hosts to obtain all or a portion of the
      centralized host table.

   <a href="rfc974.html">RFC-974</a>

      This RFC presents a description of how mail systems are expected
      to route messages based on domain system information.  In
      particular, it discusses how mailers should interpret mail
      exchanger resource records for message routing to both host and
      domain names.

   <a href="rfc1032.html">RFC-1032</a>

      This RFC describes the guidelines for a domain administrator to
      follow to establish a new domain.

   <a href="rfc1033.html">RFC-1033</a>

      This RFC provides procedures for domain administrators in
      operating a domain server and maintaining their portion of the
      hierarchical database.

   <a href="rfc1034.html">RFC-1034</a>

      This RFC introduces domain style names, their use for ARPA
      Internet mail and host address support, and the protocols and
      servers used to implement domains.  The concepts and facilities of
      the domain system are described.  The RFC also discusses the
      hierarchical database model, resource record usage, query
      formation, query resolution, and domain control.

   <a href="rfc1035.html">RFC-1035</a>

      This RFC specifies the format of domain system transactions,
      discusses the implementation of domain servers, and explores the
      use of domain names in the context of mail and other network
      software.

IMPLEMENTATIONS

   Several implementations of the domain system exist.  The first two
   paragraphs (JEEVES and BIND) discuss the prominent (and most mature)
   two implementations and their authors/maintainers.  These
   implementations are available online.  The last paragraphs list
   implementations under development.  Points of contact can supply more
   information.

   The intent of listing these implementations is to give vendors the
   opportunity to inspect working code.  These implementations embody
   experience with the domain system and offer interpretations of the
   protocols found acceptable in operational environments.

Tops-20 Server and Resolver (JEEVES)

   Some domain root servers on the ARPANET are hosted on TOPS-20 systems
   and run the code called JEEVES.  The JEEVES resolver is specific to
   version 5 of TOPS-20.  The code is maintained by Paul Mockapetris
   (ISI), is available using anonymous FTP from host a.isi.edu, and
   resides in the files

                   &lt;domain.version5&gt;version5.mss
                   &lt;domain.version5&gt;version5.doc
                   &lt;domain.version5&gt;version5.txt

4BSD Unix Resolver and Server (BIND)

   Most hosts running lower level domain servers on the ARPANET are
   hosted on 4BSD systems and run the code called BIND.  This code is
   maintained for periodic releases by Mike Karels (UCB).  His mail
   addresses are:

             ARPANET:  karels@okeeffe.berkeley.edu

Fuzzball Server and Resolver

   Dave Mills has both server and solver for the so-called PDP11/LSI- 11
   Fuzzballs.  However, these are not complete implementations and do
   not support zone transfers and so forth.  They have little use
   outside the fuzzball community, since the code is in assembler and is
   not for Unix.  His addresses are:
