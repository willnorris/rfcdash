<meta content="In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter-
related data. Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP
receivers usually cannot start consuming the multicast data right
after they join the session. Thus, they often experience a random
acquisition delay. One approach to reduce this delay is to receive a
burst stream from a retransmission server that facilitates rapid
acquisition of the multicast stream. An RTP receiver may use this
approach (or any other approach) to achieve rapid acquisition. Yet,
due to various factors, performance of the rapid acquisition methods
usually varies. Furthermore, in some cases the RTP receiver may (or
may have to) do a simple multicast join. For quality reporting,
monitoring and diagnostics purposes, it is important to collect
detailed information from the RTP receivers about their acquisition
and presentation experiences. This document addresses this issue by
defining a new report block type, called Multicast Acquisition (MA)
Report Block, within the framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
Extended Reports (XR) (RFC 3611). This document also defines the
necessary signaling of the new MA report block type in the Session
Description Protocol (SDP)." name="DC.Description.Abstract"/>

Abstract

   In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter-
   related data.  Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP
   receivers usually cannot start consuming the multicast data right
   after they join the session.  Thus, they often experience a random
   acquisition delay.  An RTP receiver can use one or more different
   approaches to achieve rapid acquisition.  Yet, due to various
   factors, performance of the rapid acquisition methods usually varies.
   Furthermore, in some cases, the RTP receiver can do a simple
   multicast join (in other cases, it is compelled to do so).  For
   quality reporting, monitoring, and diagnostic purposes, it is
   important to collect detailed information from the RTP receivers
   about their acquisition and presentation experiences.  This document
   addresses this issue by defining a new report block type, called the
   Multicast Acquisition (MA) report block, within the framework of RTP
   Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs) (<a href="rfc3611.html">RFC 3611</a>).  This
   document also defines the necessary signaling of the new MA report
   block type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).

   The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is the out-of-band control protocol
   for applications that use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for
   media transport [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>].  In addition to providing minimal control
   functionality to RTP entities, RTCP also enables a basic-level
   monitoring of RTP sessions via sender and receiver reports.  More
   statistically detailed monitoring as well as application-specific
   monitoring are usually achieved through the RTCP Extended Reports
   (XRs) [<a href="rfc3611.html" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>].

   In most RTP-based multicast applications such as the ones carrying
   video content, the RTP source sends inter-related data.
   Consequently, the RTP application may not be able to decode and
   present the data in an RTP packet before decoding the data in one or
   more earlier RTP packets and/or before acquiring some Reference
   Information about the content itself.  Thus, RTP receivers that are
   randomly joining a multicast session often experience a random
   acquisition delay.  In order to reduce this delay, [<a href="rfc6285.html" title='"Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions"'>RFC6285</a>] proposes
   an approach where an auxiliary unicast RTP session is established
   between a retransmission server and the joining RTP receiver.  Over
   this unicast RTP session, the retransmission server provides the
   Reference Information, which is all the information the RTP receiver
   needs to rapidly acquire the multicast stream.  This method is
   referred to as the Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions
   (RAMS).  However, depending on the variability in the Source
   Filtering Group Management Protocol (SFGMP) processing times, the
   availability of network resources for rapid acquisition, and the
   nature of the RTP data, not all RTP receivers can acquire the
   multicast stream in the same amount of time.  The performance of
   rapid acquisition may vary not only for different RTP receivers but
   also over time.

   To increase the visibility of the multicast service provider in its
   network, to diagnose slow multicast acquisition issues, and to
   collect the acquisition experiences of the RTP receivers, this
   document defines a new report block type, which is called the
   Multicast Acquisition (MA) report block, within the framework of RTCP
   XR.  RTP receivers that use the method described in [<a href="rfc6285.html" title='"Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions"'>RFC6285</a>] may use
   this report every time they join a new multicast RTP session.  RTP
   receivers that use a different method for rapid acquisition or those
   that do not use any method but rather do a simple multicast join may
   also use this report.  This way, the multicast service provider can
   quantitatively compare the improvements achieved by different

   This section defines the format of the MA report block.  The base
   report is payload independent.  An extension mechanism is provided
   where further optional payload-independent and payload-specific
   information can be included in the report as desired.

   The OPTIONAL extensions that are defined in this document are
   primarily developed for the method presented in [<a href="rfc6285.html" title='"Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions"'>RFC6285</a>].  Other
   methods that provide rapid acquisition can define their own
   extensions to be used in the MA report block.

   The packet format for the RTCP XR is defined in <a href="rfc3611.html#section-2">Section 2 of
   [RFC3611]</a>.  Each XR packet has a fixed-length field for version,
   padding, reserved bits, payload type (PT), length, synchronization
   source (SSRC) of packet sender as well as a variable-length field for
   report blocks.  In the XR packets, the PT field is set to XR (207).

   It is better to send the MA report block after all the necessary
   information is collected and computed.  Partial reporting is
   generally not useful as it cannot give the full picture of the
   multicast acquisition, and it causes additional complexity in terms
   of report block matching and correlation.  The MA report block is
   only sent as a part of an RTCP compound packet, and it is sent in the
   primary multicast session.

   The need for reliability of the MA report block is not any greater
   than other report blocks or types.  If desired, the report block
   could be repeated for redundancy purposes while respecting the RTCP
   scheduling algorithms.

   Following the rules specified in [<a href="rfc3550.html" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RFC3550</a>], all integer fields in the
   base report and extensions defined below are carried in network-byte
   order, that is, most significant byte (octet) first, also known as
   big-endian.  Unless otherwise stated, numeric constants are in
   decimal (base 10).

           Figure 1: Base Report Format for the MA Report Block

   o  BT (8 bits): Field that denotes the type for this block format.
      The MA report block is identified by the constant 11.

   o  MA Method (8 bits): Field that denotes the type of the MA method
      (e.g., simple join, RAMS, etc.).  See <a href="#section-7.3">Section 7.3</a> for the values
      registered with IANA.

   o  Block Length (16 bits): The length of this report block, including
      the header, in 32-bit words minus one.

   o  SSRC of the Primary Multicast Stream (32 bits): Field that denotes
      the SSRC of the primary multicast stream.

   o  Status (16 bits): Field that denotes the status code for the MA
      operation.

      This document defines several status codes and registers them with
      IANA in <a href="#section-7.5">Section 7.5</a>.  If a new vendor-neutral status code will be
      defined, it MUST be registered with IANA according to the
      guidelines specified in <a href="#section-7.5">Section 7.5</a>.  If the new status code is
      intended to be used privately by a vendor, there is no need for
      IANA management.  <a href="#section-4.2.2">Section 4.2.2</a> defines how a vendor defines and
      uses private extensions to convey its messages.

      To indicate use of a private extension, the RTP receiver MUST set
      the Status field to zero.  A private extension MUST NOT be used in
      an XR unless the RTP receiver knows from out-of-band methods that
      the entity that will receive and process the XR understands the
      private extension.

   o  Rsvd. (16 bits): The RTP receiver MUST set this field to zero.
      The recipient MUST ignore this field when received.

   If the multicast join was successful, meaning that at least one
   multicast packet was received, some additional information MUST be
   appended to the base report as described in <a href="#section-4.2.1">Section 4.2.1</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.1.%20%20Status%20Code%20Rules%20for%20New%20MA%20Methods"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.1" name="section-4.1.1">4.1.1</a>.  Status Code Rules for New MA Methods</span>

   Different MA methods usually use different status codes, although
   some status codes (e.g., a code indicating that multicast join has
   failed) can be common among multiple MA methods.  The status code
   reported in the base report MUST always be within the scope of the
   particular MA method specified in the MA Method field.

   In certain MA methods, the RTP receiver can generate a status code
   for its multicast acquisition attempt or can be told by another
   network element or RTP endpoint what the current status is via a
   response code.  In such cases, the RTP receiver MAY report the value
   of the received response code as its status code if the response code
   has a higher priority.  Each MA method needs to outline the rules
   pertaining to its response and status codes so that RTP receiver
   implementations can determine what to report in any given scenario.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.2.%20%20Status%20Code%20Rules%20for%20the%20RAMS%20Method"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1.2" name="section-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>.  Status Code Rules for the RAMS Method</span>

   In this section, we provide the status code rules for the RAMS method
   described in [<a href="rfc6285.html" title='"Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions"'>RFC6285</a>].

   <a href="rfc6285.html#section-11.6">Section 11.6 of [RFC6285]</a> defines several response codes.  The 1xx-
   and 2xx-level response codes are informational and success response
   codes, respectively.  If the RTP receiver receives a 1xx- or 2xx-
   level response code, then the RTP receiver MUST use one of the 1xxx-
   level status codes defined in <a href="#section-7.5">Section 7.5</a> of this document.  If the
   RTP receiver receives a 4xx- or 5xx-level response code (indicating
   receiver-side and server-side errors, respectively), then the RTP
   receiver MUST use the response code as its status code.  In other
   words, the 4xx- and 5xx-level response codes have a higher priority
   than the 1xxx-level status codes.

   To improve the reporting scope, it might be desirable to define new
   fields in the MA report block.  Such fields are to be encoded as TLV
   elements as described below and sketched in Figure 2:

   o  Type: A single-octet identifier that defines the type of the
      parameter represented in this TLV element.

   o  Length: A two-octet field that indicates the length (in octets) of
      the TLV element excluding the Type and Length fields and the 8-bit
      Reserved field between them.  Note that this length does not
      include any padding that is needed for alignment.

   o  Value: Variable-size set of octets that contains the specific
      value for the parameter.

   In the extensions, the Reserved field MUST be set to zero and ignored
   on reception.  If a TLV element does not fall on a 32-bit boundary,
   the last word MUST be padded to the boundary using further bits set
   to zero.

   In the MA report block, the RTP receiver MUST place any vendor-
   neutral or private extension after the base report.

   If the goal in defining new TLV elements is to extend the report
   block in a vendor-neutral manner, they need to be registered with
   IANA according to the guidelines provided in <a href="#section-7.4">Section 7.4</a>.

   This document defines several vendor-neutral extensions.  First, we
   present the TLV elements that can be used by any RTP-based multicast
   application.

   o  RTP Seqnum of the First Multicast Packet (16 bits): TLV element
      that specifies the RTP sequence number of the first multicast
      packet received for the primary multicast stream.  If the
      multicast join was successful, this element MUST be included.  If
      no multicast packet has been received, this element MUST NOT exist
      in the report block.

      Type: 1

   o  SFGMP Join Time (32 bits): TLV element that denotes the greater of
      zero or the time difference (in ms) between the instant the SFGMP
      Join message was sent and the instant the first packet was

      received in the multicast session.  If the multicast join was
      successful, this element MUST be included.  If no multicast packet
      has been received, this element MUST NOT exist in the report
      block.

      Type: 2

   o  Application Request-to-Multicast Delta Time (32 bits): OPTIONAL
      TLV element that denotes the time difference (in ms) between the
      instant the application became aware it would join a new multicast
      session and the instant the first RTP packet was received from the
      primary multicast stream.  If no such packet has been received,
      this element MUST NOT exist in the report block.

      Type: 3

   o  Application Request-to-Presentation Delta Time (32 bits): OPTIONAL
      TLV element that denotes the time difference (in ms) between the
      instant the application became aware it would join a new multicast
      session and the instant the media was first presented.  If the RTP
      receiver cannot successfully present the media, this element MUST
      NOT exist in the report block.

      Type: 4

   We next present the TLV elements that can be used when the RTP
   receiver supports and uses the RAMS method described in [<a href="rfc6285.html" title='"Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions"'>RFC6285</a>].
   However, if the RTP receiver does not send a rapid acquisition
   request, the following TLV elements MUST NOT exist in the MA report
   block.  Some elements may or may not exist depending on whether or
   not the RTP receiver receives any packet from the unicast burst
   and/or the primary multicast stream.  These are explained below.

   o  Application Request-to-RAMS Request Delta Time (32 bits): OPTIONAL
      TLV element that denotes the time difference (in ms) between the
      instant the application became aware it would request a rapid
      acquisition and the instant the rapid acquisition request was
      actually sent by the application.

      Type: 11

   o  RAMS Request-to-RAMS Information Delta Time (32 bits): OPTIONAL
      TLV element that denotes the time difference (in ms) between the
      instant the rapid acquisition request was sent and the instant the

   o  RAMS Request-to-Burst Delta Time (32 bits): OPTIONAL TLV element
      that denotes the time difference (in ms) between the instant the
      rapid acquisition request was sent and the instant the first burst
      packet was received in the unicast session.  If no burst packet
      has been received, this element MUST NOT exist in the report
      block.

      Type: 13

   o  RAMS Request-to-Multicast Delta Time (32 bits): OPTIONAL TLV
      element that denotes the time difference (in ms) between the
      instant the rapid acquisition request was sent and the instant the
      first RTP packet was received from the primary multicast stream.
      If no such packet has been received, this element MUST NOT exist
      in the report block.

   o  RAMS Request-to-Burst-Completion Delta Time (32 bits): OPTIONAL
      TLV element that denotes the time difference (in ms) between the
      instant the rapid acquisition request was sent and the instant the
      last burst packet was received in the unicast session.  If no
      burst packet has been received, this element MUST NOT exist in the
      report block.

      Type: 15

   o  Number of Duplicate Packets (32 bits): OPTIONAL TLV element that
      denotes the number of duplicate packets due to receiving the same
      packet in both unicast and primary multicast RTP sessions.  If no
      RTP packet has been received from the primary multicast stream,
      this element MUST NOT exist.  If no burst packet has been received
      in the unicast session, the value of this element MUST be set to
      zero.

      Type: 16

   o  Size of Burst-to-Multicast Gap (32 bits): OPTIONAL TLV element
      that denotes the greater of zero or the difference between the

      primary multicast stream) and the sequence number of the last
      burst packet minus 1 (considering the wrapping of the sequence

   It is desirable to allow vendors to use private extensions in TLV
   format.  The range of [128-254] of TLV Types is reserved for private
   extensions.  IANA management for these extensions is unnecessary;
   they are the responsibility of individual vendors.

   Implementations use the structure depicted in Figure 3 for private
   extensions.  Here, the private enterprise numbers are used from

   The security considerations of [<a href="rfc3611.html" title='"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR)"'>RFC3611</a>] apply in this document as
   well.

   The information contained in MA reports could be stolen as with any
   other RTCP reports if proper protection mechanism(s) are not in
   place.  If desired, similar to other RTCP XRs, the MA reports MAY be
   protected by using Secure RTP (SRTP) and Secure RTP Control Protocol
   (SRTCP) [<a href="rfc3711.html" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>].

   Malicious sniffing or otherwise obtaining MA report blocks can reveal
   performance characteristics of the RTP service and underlying
   network.  This information is mostly available to an observer with
   the ability to capture RTP and RTCP session traffic.  The contents
   and value of any private extension need to be studied when
   considering the necessity to secure the MA reports since application-
   level performance data might be present that is not otherwise
   available to an attacker, as with the required fields and vendor-
   neutral extensions.

   Using the MA reports to provide feedback into the acquisition of the
   multicast streams can introduce possible additional security
   implications.  If a forged or otherwise modified MA report is
   received for an earlier acquisition attempt, invalid data can be used
   as input in later rapid acquisition attempts.  For example,
   incorrectly small SFGMP join times could cause the unicast burst to
   be too short, leading to gaps in sequence numbers in the approach
   discussed in [<a href="rfc6285.html" title='"Unicast-Based Rapid Acquisition of Multicast RTP Sessions"'>RFC6285</a>].  Additionally, forged reports could give the
   appearance that rapid acquisition is performing correctly when it is
   in fact failing, or vice versa.  While integrity protection can be
   achieved in different ways, we RECOMMEND the use of SRTCP [<a href="rfc3711.html" title='"The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)"'>RFC3711</a>].

   A new IANA TLV space registry for the status codes has been created.
   The registry is called the "Multicast Acquisition Status Code Space
   Registry".  This registry is to be managed by the IANA according to
   the Specification Required policy of [<a href="rfc5226.html" title='"Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"'>RFC5226</a>].

   The length of the Status field is two octets, allowing 65536 codes.
   However, the status codes have been registered to allow for an easier
   classification.  For example, the values between (and including) 1
   and 1000 are primarily used by the MA method of simple join.  The
   values between (and including) 1001 and 2000 are used by the MA
