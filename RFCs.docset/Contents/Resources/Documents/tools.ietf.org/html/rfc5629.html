Abstract

   This document describes a framework for the interaction between users
   and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based applications.  By
   interacting with applications, users can guide the way in which they
   operate.  The focus of this framework is stimulus signaling, which
   allows a user agent (UA) to interact with an application without
   knowledge of the semantics of that application.  Stimulus signaling
   can occur to a user interface running locally with the client, or to
   a remote user interface, through media streams.  Stimulus signaling
   encompasses a wide range of mechanisms, ranging from clicking on
   hyperlinks, to pressing buttons, to traditional Dual-Tone Multi-
   Frequency (DTMF) input.  In all cases, stimulus signaling is
   supported through the use of markup languages, which play a key role
   in this framework.

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [<a href="#ref-2" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>2</a>] provides the ability for
   users to initiate, manage, and terminate communications sessions.
   Frequently, these sessions will involve a SIP application.  A SIP
   application is defined as a program running on a SIP-based element
   (such as a proxy or user agent) that provides some value-added
   function to a user or system administrator.  Examples of SIP
   applications include prepaid calling card calls, conferencing, and
   presence-based [<a href="#ref-12" title='"A Model for Presence and Instant Messaging"'>12</a>] call routing.

   In order for most applications to properly function, they need input
   from the user to guide their operation.  As an example, a prepaid
   calling card application requires the user to input their calling
   card number, their PIN code, and the destination number they wish to
   reach.  The process by which a user provides input to an application
   is called "application interaction".

   Application interaction can be either functional or stimulus.
   Functional interaction requires the user device to understand the
   semantics of the application, whereas stimulus interaction does not.
   Stimulus signaling allows for applications to be built without
   requiring modifications to the user device.  Stimulus interaction is
   the subject of this framework.  The framework provides a model for
   how users interact with applications through user interfaces, and how
   user interfaces and applications can be distributed throughout a
   network.  This model is then used to describe how applications can
   instantiate and manage user interfaces.

   SIP Application:  A SIP application is defined as a program running
      on a SIP-based element (such as a proxy or user agent) that
      provides some value-added function to a user or system
      administrator.  Examples of SIP applications include prepaid
      calling card calls, conferencing, and presence-based [<a href="#ref-12" title='"A Model for Presence and Instant Messaging"'>12</a>] call
      routing.

   Application Interaction:  The process by which a user provides input
      to an application.

   Real-Time Application Interaction:  Application interaction that
      takes place while an application instance is executing.  For
      example, when a user enters their PIN number into a prepaid
      calling card application, this is real-time application
      interaction.

   Non-Real-Time Application Interaction:  Application interaction that
      takes place asynchronously with the execution of the application.
      Generally, non-real-time application interaction is accomplished
      through provisioning.

   Functional Application Interaction:  Application interaction is
      functional when the user device has an understanding of the
      semantics of the interaction with the application.

   Stimulus Application Interaction:  Application interaction is
      stimulus when the user device has no understanding of the
      semantics of the interaction with the application.

   User Interface (UI):  The user interface provides the user with
      context to make decisions about what they want.  The user
      interacts with the device, which conveys the user input to the
      user interface.  The user interface interprets the information and
      passes it to the application.

   User Interface Component:  A piece of user interface that operates
      independently of other pieces of the user interface.  For example,
      a user might have two separate web interfaces to a prepaid calling
      card application: one for hanging up and making another call, and
      another for entering the username and PIN.

   User Device:  The software or hardware system that the user directly
      interacts with to communicate with the application.  An example of
      a user device is a telephone.  Another example is a PC with a web
      browser.

   User Device Proxy:  A software or hardware system that a user
      indirectly interacts through to communicate with the application.
      This indirection can be through a network.  An example is a
      gateway from IP to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
      It acts as a user device proxy, acting on behalf of the user on
      the circuit network.

   User Input:  The "raw" information passed from a user to a user
      interface.  Examples of user input include a spoken word or a
      click on a hyperlink.

   Client-Local User Interface:  A user interface that is co-resident
      with the user device.

   Client-Remote User Interface:  A user interface that executes
      remotely from the user device.  In this case, a standardized
      interface is needed between the user device and the user
      interface.  Typically, this is done through media sessions: audio,
      video, or application sharing.

   Markup Language:  A markup language describes a logical flow of
      presentation of information to the user, collection of information
      from the user, and transmission of that information to an
      application.

   Media Interaction:  A means of separating a user and a user interface
      by connecting them with media streams.

   Interactive Voice Response (IVR):  An IVR is a type of user interface
      that allows users to speak commands to the application, and hear
      responses to those commands prompting for more information.

   Prompt-and-Collect:  The basic primitive of an IVR user interface.
      The user is presented with a voice option, and the user speaks
      their choice.

   Barge-In:  The act of entering information into an IVR user interface
      prior to the completion of a prompt requesting that information.

   Focus:  A user interface component has focus when user input is
      provided to it, as opposed to any other user interface components.
      This is not to be confused with the term "focus" within the SIP
      conferencing framework, which refers to the center user agent in a
      conference [<a href="#ref-14" title='"A Framework for Conferencing with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>14</a>].

   Focus Determination:  The process by which the user device determines
      which user interface component will receive the user input.

   Focusless Device:  A user device that has no ability to perform focus
      determination.  An example of a focusless device is a telephone
      with a keypad.

   Presentation-Capable UI:  A user interface that can prompt the user
      with input, collect results, and then prompt the user with new
      information based on those results.

   Presentation-Free UI:  A user interface that cannot prompt the user
      with information.

   Feature Interaction:  A class of problems that result when multiple
      applications or application components are trying to provide
      services to a user at the same time.

   Inter-Application Feature Interaction:  Feature interactions that
      occur between applications.

   DTMF:  Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency.  DTMF refers to a class of tones
      generated by circuit-switched telephony devices when the user
      presses a key on the keypad.  As a result, DTMF and keypad input
      are often used synonymously, when in fact one of them (DTMF) is
      merely a means of conveying the other (the keypad input) to a
      client-remote user interface (the switch, for example).

   Application Instance:  A single execution path of a SIP application.

   Originating Application:  A SIP application that acts as a User Agent
      Client (UAC), making a call on behalf of the user.

   Terminating Application:  A SIP application that acts as a User Agent
      Server (UAS), answering a call generated by a user.  IVR
      applications are terminating applications.

   Intermediary Application:  A SIP application that is neither the
      caller or callee, but rather a third party involved in a call.

                Figure 1: Model for Real-Time Interactions

   Figure 1 presents a general model for how users interact with
   applications.  Generally, users interact with a user interface
   through a user device.  A user device can be a telephone, or it can
   be a PC with a web browser.  Its role is to pass the user input from
   the user to the user interface.  The user interface provides the user
   with context in order to make decisions about what they want.  The
   user interacts with the device, causing information to be passed from
   the device to the user interface.  The user interface interprets the
   information, and passes it as a user interface event to the
   application.  The application may be able to modify the user
   interface based on this event.  Whether or not this is possible
   depends on the type of user interface.

   User interfaces are fundamentally about rendering and interpretation.
   Rendering refers to the way in which the user is provided context.
   This can be through hyperlinks, images, sounds, videos, text, and so
   on.  Interpretation refers to the way in which the user interface
   takes the "raw" data provided by the user, and returns the result to
   the application as a meaningful event, abstracted from the
   particulars of the user interface.  As an example, consider a prepaid
   calling card application.  The user interface worries about details
   such as what prompt the user is provided, whether the voice is male
   or female, and so on.  It is concerned with recognizing the speech
   that the user provides, in order to obtain the desired information.
   In this case, the desired information is the calling card number, the
   PIN code, and the destination number.  The application needs that
   data, and it doesn't matter to the application whether it was
   collected using a male prompt or a female one.

   User interfaces generally have real-time requirements towards the
   user.  That is, when a user interacts with the user interface, the
   user interface needs to react quickly, and that change needs to be
   propagated to the user right away.  However, the interface between
   the user interface and the application need not be that fast.  Faster
   is better, but the user interface itself can frequently compensate
   for long latencies between the user interface and the application.
   In the case of a prepaid calling card application, when the user is
   prompted to enter their PIN, the prompt should generally stop
   immediately once the first digit of the PIN is entered.  This is
   referred to as "barge-in".  After the user interface collects the
   rest of the PIN, it can tell the user to "please wait while
   processing".  The PIN can then be gradually transmitted to the
   application.  In this example, the user interface has compensated for
   a slow UI to application interface by asking the user to wait.

   The separation between user interface and application is absolutely
   fundamental to the entire framework provided in this document.  Its
   importance cannot be overstated.

   With this basic model, we can begin to taxonomize the types of
   systems that can be built.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.1.%20%20Functional%20vs.%20Stimulus"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Functional vs. Stimulus</span>

   The first way to taxonomize the system is to consider the interface
   between the UI and the application.  There are two fundamentally
   different models for this interface.  In a functional interface, the
   user interface has detailed knowledge about the application and is,
   in fact, specific to the application.  The interface between the two
   components is through a functional protocol, capable of representing
   the semantics that can be exposed through the user interface.
   Because the user interface has knowledge of the application, it can
   be optimally designed for that application.  As a result, functional
   user interfaces are almost always the most user friendly, the
   fastest, and the most responsive.  However, in order to allow
   interoperability between user devices and applications, the details
   of the functional protocols need to be specified in standards.  This
   slows down innovation and limits the scope of applications that can
   be built.

   An alternative is a stimulus interface.  In a stimulus interface, the
   user interface is generic -- that is, totally ignorant of the details
   of the application.  Indeed, the application may pass instructions to
   the user interface describing how it should operate.  The user
   interface translates user input into "stimulus", which are data
   understood only by the application, and not by the user interface.
   Because they are generic, and because they require communications
   with the application in order to change the way in which they render
   information to the user, stimulus user interfaces are usually slower,
   less user friendly, and less responsive than a functional
   counterpart.  However, they allow for substantial innovation in
   applications, since no standardization activity is needed to build a
   new application, as long as it can interact with the user within the
   confines of the user interface mechanism.  The web is an example of a
   stimulus user interface to applications.

   In SIP systems, functional interfaces are provided by extending the
   SIP protocol to provide the needed functionality.  For example, the
   SIP caller preferences specification [<a href="#ref-15" title='"Caller Preferences for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>15</a>] provides a functional
   interface that allows a user to request applications to route the
   call to specific types of user agents.  Functional interfaces are
   important, but are not the subject of this framework.  The primary
   goal of this framework is to address the role of stimulus interfaces
   to SIP applications.

   Application interaction systems can also be real-time or non-real-
   time.  Non-real-time interaction allows the user to enter information
   about application operation asynchronously with its invocation.
   Frequently, this is done through provisioning systems.  As an
   example, a user can set up the forwarding number for a call-forward
   on no-answer application using a web page.  Real-time interaction
   requires the user to interact with the application at the time of its
   invocation.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20Client-Local%20vs.%20Client-Remote"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Client-Local vs. Client-Remote</span>

   Another axis in the taxonomization is whether the user interface is
   co-resident with the user device (which we refer to as a client-local
   user interface), or the user interface runs in a host separated from
   the client (which we refer to as a client-remote user interface).  In
   a client-remote user interface, there exists some kind of protocol
   between the client device and the UI that allows the client to
   interact with the user interface over a network.

   The most important way to separate the UI and the client device is
   through media interaction.  In media interaction, the interface
   between the user and the user interface is through media: audio,
   video, messaging, and so on.  This is the classic mode of operation
   for VoiceXML [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Voice Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML) Version 2.0"'>5</a>], where the user interface (also referred to as the
   voice browser) runs on a platform in the network.  Users communicate
   with the voice browser through the telephone network (or using a SIP
   session).  The voice browser interacts with the application using
   HTTP to convey the information collected from the user.

   In the case of a client-local user interface, the user interface runs
   co-located with the user device.  The interface between them is
   through the software that interprets the user's input and passes it
   to the user interface.  The classic example of this is the Web.  In
   the Web, the user interface is a web browser, and the interface is
   defined by the HTML document that it's rendering.  The user interacts
   directly with the user interface running in the browser.  The results
   of that user interface are sent to the application (running on the
   web server) using HTTP.

   It is important to note that whether or not the user interface is
   local or remote (in the case of media interaction) is not a property
   of the modality of the interface, but rather a property of the
   system.  As an example, it is possible for a Web-based user interface
   to be provided with a client-remote user interface.  In such a
   scenario, video- and application-sharing media sessions can be used
   between the user and the user interface.  The user interface, still



<span class="grey">Rosenberg                   Standards Track                    [Page 10]</span></pre>

   guided by HTML, now runs "in the network", remote from the client.
   Similarly, a VoiceXML document can be interpreted locally by a client
   device, with no media streams at all.  Indeed, the VoiceXML document
   can be rendered using text, rather than media, with no impact on the
   interface between the user interface and the application.

   It is also important to note that systems can be hybrid.  In a hybrid
   user interface, some aspects of it (usually those associated with a
   particular modality) run locally, and others run remotely.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20Presentation-Capable%20vs.%20Presentation-Free"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  Presentation-Capable vs. Presentation-Free</span>

   A user interface can be capable of presenting information to the user
   (a presentation-capable UI), or it can be capable only of collecting
   user input (a presentation-free UI).  These are very different types
   of user interfaces.  A presentation-capable UI can provide the user
   with feedback after every input, providing the context for collecting
   the next input.  As a result, presentation-capable user interfaces
   require an update to the information provided to the user after each
   input.  The Web is a classic example of this.  After every input
   (i.e., a click), the browser provides the input to the application
   and fetches the next page to render.  In a presentation-free user
   interface, this is not the case.  Since the user is not provided with
   feedback, these user interfaces tend to merely collect information as
   it's entered, and pass it to the application.

   Another difference is that a presentation-free user interface cannot
   easily support the concept of a focus.  Selection of a focus usually
   requires a means for informing the user of the available
   applications, allowing the user to choose, and then informing them
   about which one they have chosen.  Without the first and third steps
   (which a presentation-free UI cannot provide), focus selection is
   very difficult.  Without a selected focus, the input provided to
   applications through presentation-free user interfaces is more of a
   broadcast or notification operation.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Interaction%20Scenarios%20on%20Telephones"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Interaction Scenarios on Telephones</span>

   In this section, we apply the model of <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> to telephones.

   In a traditional telephone, the user interface consists of a 12-key
   keypad, a speaker, and a microphone.  Indeed, from here forward, the
   term "telephone" is used to represent any device that meets, at a
   minimum, the characteristics described in the previous sentence.
   Circuit-switched telephony applications are almost universally
   client-remote user interfaces.  In the Public Switched Telephone
   Network (PSTN), there is usually a circuit interface between the user
   and the user interface.  The user input from the keypad is conveyed

   using Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF), and the microphone input as
   Pulse Code Modulated (PCM) encoded voice.

   In an IP-based system, there is more variability in how the system
   can be instantiated.  Both client-remote and client-local user
   interfaces to a telephone can be provided.

   In this framework, a PSTN gateway can be considered a User Device
   Proxy.  It is a proxy for the user because it can provide, to a user
   interface on an IP network, input taken from a user on a circuit-
   switched telephone.  The gateway may be able to run a client-local
   user interface, just as an IP telephone might.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20Client%20Remote"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Client Remote</span>

   The most obvious instantiation is the "classic" circuit-switched
   telephony model.  In that model, the user interface runs remotely
   from the client.  The interface between the user and the user
   interface is through media, which is set up by SIP and carried over
   the Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [<a href="#ref-18" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>18</a>].  The microphone input
   can be carried using any suitable voice-encoding algorithm.  The
   keypad input can be conveyed in one of two ways.  The first is to
   convert the keypad input to DTMF, and then convey that DTMF using a
   suitable encoding algorithm (such as PCMU).  An alternative, and
   generally the preferred approach, is to transmit the keypad input
   using <a href="rfc4733.html">RFC 4733</a> [<a href="#ref-19" title='"RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals"'>19</a>], which provides an encoding mechanism for
   carrying keypad input within RTP.

   In this classic model, the user interface would run on a server in
   the IP network.  It would perform speech recognition and DTMF
   recognition to derive the user intent, feed them through the user
   interface, and provide the result to an application.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Client%20Local"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Client Local</span>

   An alternative model is for the entire user interface to reside on
   the telephone.  The user interface can be a VoiceXML browser, running
   speech recognition on the microphone input, and feeding the keypad
   input directly into the script.  As discussed above, the VoiceXML
   script could be rendered using text instead of voice, if the
   telephone has a textual display.

   For simpler phones without a display, the user interface can be
   described by a Keypad Markup Language request document [<a href="#ref-8" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Key Press Stimulus (KPML)"'>8</a>].  As the
   user enters digits in the keypad, they are passed to the user
   interface, which generates user interface events that can be
   transported to the application.

   A middle-ground approach is to flip back and forth between a client-
   local and client-remote user interface.  Many voice applications are
   of the type that listen to the media stream and wait for some
   specific trigger that kicks off a more complex user interaction.  The
   long pound in a prepaid calling card application is one example.
   Another example is a conference recording application, where the user
   can press a key at some point in the call to begin recording.  When
   the key is pressed, the user hears a whisper to inform them that
   recording has started.

   The ideal way to support such an application is to install a client-
   local user interface component that waits for the trigger to kick off
   the real interaction.  Once the trigger is received, the application
   connects the user to a client-remote user interface that can play
   announcements, collect more information, and so on.

   The benefit of flip-flopping between a client-local and client-remote
   user interface is cost.  The client-local user interface will
   eliminate the need to send media streams into the network just to
   wait for the user to press the pound key on the keypad.

   The Keypad Markup Language (KPML) was designed to support exactly
   this kind of need [<a href="#ref-8" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Key Press Stimulus (KPML)"'>8</a>].  It models the keypad on a phone and allows an
   application to be informed when any sequence of keys has been
   pressed.  However, KPML has no presentation component.  Since user
   interfaces generally require a response to user input, the
   presentation will need to be done using a client-remote user
   interface that gets instantiated as a result of the trigger.

   It is tempting to use a hybrid model, where a prompt-and-collect
   application is implemented by using a client-remote user interface
   that plays the prompts, and a client-local user interface, described
   by KPML, that collects digits.  However, this only complicates the
   application.  Firstly, the keypad input will be sent to both the
   media stream and the KPML user interface.  This requires the
   application to sort out which user inputs are duplicates, a process
   that is very complicated.  Secondly, the primary benefit of KPML is
   to avoid having a media stream towards a user interface.  However,
   there is already a media stream for the prompting, so there is no
   real savings.

   In this framework, we use the term "SIP application" to refer to a
   broad set of functionality.  A SIP application is a program running
   on a SIP-based element (such as a proxy or user agent) that provides



<span class="grey">Rosenberg                   Standards Track                    [Page 13]</span></pre>

   some value-added function to a user or system administrator.  SIP
   applications can execute on behalf of a caller, a called party, or a
   multitude of users at once.

   Each application has a number of instances that are executing at any
   given time.  An instance represents a single execution path for an
   application.  It is established as a result of some event.  That
   event can be a SIP event, such as the reception of a SIP INVITE
   request, or it can be a non-SIP event, such as a web form post or
   even a timer.  Application instances also have an end time.  Some
   instances have a lifetime that is coupled with a SIP transaction or
   dialog.  For example, a proxy application might begin when an INVITE
   arrives, and terminate when the call is answered.  Other applications
   have a lifetime that spans multiple dialogs or transactions.  For
   example, a conferencing application instance may exist so long as
   there are dialogs connected to it.  When the last dialog terminates,
   the application instance terminates.  Other applications have a
   lifetime that is completely decoupled from SIP events.

   It is fundamental to the framework described here that multiple
   application instances may interact with a user during a single SIP
   transaction or dialog.  Each instance may be for the same
   application, or different applications.  Each of the applications may
   be completely independent, in that each may be owned by a different
   provider, and may not be aware of each other's existence.  Similarly,
   there may be application instances interacting with the caller, and
   instances interacting with the callee, both within the same
   transaction or dialog.

   The first step in the interaction with the user is to instantiate one
   or more user interface components for the application instance.  A
   user interface component is a single piece of the user interface that
   is defined by a logical flow that is not synchronously coupled with
   any other component.  In other words, each component runs
   independently.

   A user interface component can be instantiated in one of the user
   agents in a dialog (for a client-local user interface), or within a
   network element (for a client-remote user interface).  If a client-
   local user interface is to be used, the application needs to
   determine whether or not the user agent is capable of supporting a
   client-local user interface, and in what format.  In this framework,
   all client-local user interface components are described by a markup
   language.  A markup language describes a logical flow of presentation
   of information to the user, a collection of information from the
   user, and a transmission of that information to an application.
   Examples of markup languages include HTML, Wireless Markup Language
   (WML), VoiceXML, and the Keypad Markup Language (KPML) [<a href="#ref-8" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Key Press Stimulus (KPML)"'>8</a>].



<span class="grey">Rosenberg                   Standards Track                    [Page 14]</span></pre>

   Unlike an application instance, which has a very flexible lifetime, a
   user interface component has a very fixed lifetime.  A user interface
   component is always associated with a dialog.  The user interface
   component can be created at any point after the dialog (or early
   dialog) is created.  However, the user interface component terminates
   when the dialog terminates.  The user interface component can be
   terminated earlier by the user agent, and possibly by the
   application, but its lifetime never exceeds that of its associated
   dialog.

   There are two ways to create a client-local interface component.  For
   interface components that are presentation capable, the application
   sends a REFER [<a href="#ref-7" title='"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Refer Method"'>7</a>] request to the user agent.  The Refer-To header
   field contains an HTTP URI that points to the markup for the user
   interface, and the REFER contains a Target-Dialog header field [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Request Authorization through Dialog Identification in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>10</a>]
   which identifies the dialog associated with the user interface
   component.  For user interface components that are presentation free
   (such as those defined by KPML), the application sends a SUBSCRIBE
   request to the user agent.  The body of the SUBSCRIBE request
   contains a filter, which, in this case, is the markup that defines
   when information is to be sent to the application in a NOTIFY.  The
   SUBSCRIBE does not contain the Target-Dialog header field, since
   equivalent information is conveyed in the Event header field.

   If a user interface component is to be instantiated in the network,
   there is no need to determine the capabilities of the device on which
   the user interface is instantiated.  Presumably, it is on a device on
   which the application knows a UI can be created.  However, the
   application does need to connect the user device to the user
   interface.  This will require manipulation of media streams in order
   to establish that connection.

   The interface between the user interface component and the
   application depends on the type of user interface.  For presentation-
   capable user interfaces, such as those described by HTML and
   VoiceXML, HTTP form POST operations are used.  For presentation-free
   user interfaces, a SIP NOTIFY is used.  The differing needs and
   capabilities of these two user interfaces, as described in
   <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>, are what drives the different choices for the
   interactions.  Since presentation-capable user interfaces require an
   update to the presentation every time user data is entered, they are
   a good match for HTTP.  Since presentation-free user interfaces
   merely transmit user input to the application, a NOTIFY is more
   appropriate.

   Indeed, for presentation-free user interfaces, there are two
   different modalities of operation.  The first is called "one shot".
   In the one-shot role, the markup waits for a user to enter some



<span class="grey">Rosenberg                   Standards Track                    [Page 15]</span></pre>

   information and, when they do, reports this event to the application.
   The application then does something, and the markup is no longer
   used.  In the other modality, called "monitor", the markup stays
   permanently resident, and reports information back to an application
   until termination of the associated dialog.

                      Figure 2: Third-Party Topology

   In this topology, the application that is interested in interacting
   with the users exists outside of the SIP dialog between the user
   agents.  In that case, the application learns about the initiation
   and termination of the dialog, along with the dialog identifiers,
   through some out-of-band means.  One such possibility is the dialog
   event package [<a href="#ref-16" title='"An INVITE- Initiated Dialog Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>16</a>].  Dialog information is only revealed to trusted
   parties, so the application would need to be trusted by one of the
   users in order to obtain this information.

   At any point during the dialog, the application can instantiate user
   interface components on the user device of the caller or callee.  It
   can do this using either SUBSCRIBE or REFER, depending on the type of
   user interface (presentation capable or presentation free).

                      Figure 3: Co-Resident Topology

   In this deployment topology, the application is co-resident with one
   of the user agents (the one on the right in the picture above).  This
   application can install client-local user interface components on the
   other user agent, which is acting as the user device.  These
   components can be installed using either SUBSCRIBE, for presentation-
   free user interfaces, or REFER, for presentation-capable ones.  This
   situation typically arises when the application wishes to install UI
   components on a presentation-capable user interface.  If the only
   user input is via keypad input, the framework is not needed per se,
   because the UA/application will receive the input via <a href="rfc4733.html">RFC 4733</a> in the
   RTP stream.

   If the application resides in the called party, it is called a
   "terminating application".  If it resides in the calling party, it is
   called an "originating application".

   This kind of topology is common in protocol converter and gateway
   applications.

                   Figure 4: User Device Proxy Topology

   In this deployment topology, there is a third-party application as in
   <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>.  However, instead of installing a user interface
   component on the end user device, the component is installed in an
   intermediate device, known as a User Device Proxy.  From the
   perspective of the actual user device (on the left), the User Device
   Proxy is a client remote user interface.  As such, media, typically
   transported using RTP (including <a href="rfc4733.html">RFC 4733</a> for carrying user input),
   is sent from the user device to the client remote user interface on
   the User Device Proxy.  As far as the application is concerned, it is
   installing what it thinks is a client-local user interface on the
   user device, but it happens to be on a user device proxy that looks
   like the user device to the application.

   The user device proxy will need to terminate and re-originate both
   signaling (SIP) and media traffic towards the actual peer in the
   conversation.  The User Device Proxy is a media relay in the
   terminology of <a href="rfc3550.html">RFC 3550</a> [<a href="#ref-18" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>18</a>].  The User Device Proxy will need to
   monitor the media streams associated with each dialog, in order to
   convert user input received in the media stream to events reported to
   the user interface.  This can pose a challenge in multi-media
   systems, where it may be unclear on which media stream the user input
   is being sent.  As discussed in <a href="rfc3264.html">RFC 3264</a> [<a href="#ref-20" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>20</a>], if a user agent has a
   single media source and is supporting multiple streams, it is
   supposed to send that source to all streams.  In cases where there
   are multiple sources, the mapping is a matter of local policy.  In

   the absence of a way to explicitly identify or request which sources
   map to which streams, the user device proxy will need to do the best
   job it can.  This specification RECOMMENDS that the User Device Proxy
   monitor the first stream (defined in terms of ordering of media
   sessions within a session description).  As such, user agents SHOULD
   send their user input on the first stream, absent a policy to direct
   it otherwise.

                   Figure 5: Proxy Application Topology

   In this topology, the application is co-resident with a transaction
   stateful, record-routing proxy server on the call path between two
   user devices.  The application uses SUBSCRIBE or REFER to install
   user interface components on one or both user devices.

   This topology is common in routing applications, such as a web-
   assisted call-routing application.

   The behavior of an application within this framework depends on
   whether it seeks to use a client-local or client-remote user
   interface.

   One key component of this framework is support for client-local user
   interfaces.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1.1.%20%20Discovering%20Capabilities"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1.1" name="section-8.1.1">8.1.1</a>.  Discovering Capabilities</span>

   A client-local user interface can only be instantiated on a user
   agent if the user agent supports that type of user interface
   component.  Support for client-local user interface components is
   declared by both the UAC and UAS in their Allow, Accept, Supported,
   and Allow-Event header fields of dialog-initiating requests and
   responses.  If the Allow header field indicates support for the SIP
   SUBSCRIBE method, and the Allow-Event header field indicates support
   for the KPML package [<a href="#ref-8" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Key Press Stimulus (KPML)"'>8</a>], and the Supported header field indicates
   support for the Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU) [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>9</a>] specification
   (which, in turn, means that the Contact header field contains a
   GRUU), it means that the UA can instantiate presentation-free user
   interface components.  In this case, the application can push
   presentation-free user interface components according to the rules of
   <a href="#section-8.1.2">Section 8.1.2</a>.  The specific markup languages that can be supported
   are indicated in the Accept header field.

   If the Allow header field indicates support for the SIP REFER method,
   and the Supported header field indicates support for the Target-
   Dialog header field [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Request Authorization through Dialog Identification in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>10</a>], and the Contact header field contains UA
   capabilities [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>6</a>] that indicate support for the HTTP URI scheme, it
   means that the UA supports presentation-capable user interface
   components.  In this case, the application can push presentation-
   capable user interface components to the client according to the
   rules of <a href="#section-8.1.2">Section 8.1.2</a>.  The specific markups that are supported are
   indicated in the Accept header field.

   A third-party application that is not present on the call path will
   not be privy to these header fields in the dialog-initiating requests
   that pass by.  As such, it will need to obtain this capability
   information in other ways.  One way is through the registration event
   package [<a href="#ref-21" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Registrations"'>21</a>], which can contain user agent capability information
   provided in REGISTER requests [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>6</a>].

   Generally, we anticipate that interface components will need to be
   created at various different points in a SIP session.  Clearly, they
   will need to be pushed during session setup, or after the session is
   established.  A user interface component is always associated with a
   specific dialog, however.




<span class="grey">Rosenberg                   Standards Track                    [Page 20]</span></pre>

   An application MUST NOT attempt to push a user interface component to
   a user agent until it has determined that the user agent has the
   necessary capabilities and a dialog has been created.  In the case of
   a UAC, this means that an application MUST NOT push a user interface
   component for an INVITE-initiated dialog until the application has
   seen a request confirming the receipt of a dialog-creating response.
   This could be an ACK for a 200 OK, or a PRACK for a provisional
   response [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Reliability of Provisional Responses in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>3</a>].  For SUBSCRIBE-initiated dialogs, the application MUST
   NOT push a user interface component until the application has seen a
   200 OK to the NOTIFY request.  For a user interface component on a
   UAS, the application MUST NOT push a user interface component for an
   INVITE-initiated dialog until it has seen a dialog-creating response
   from the UAS.  For a SUBSCRIBE-initiated dialog, it MUST NOT push a
   user interface component until it has seen a NOTIFY request from the
   notifier.

   To create a presentation-capable UI component on the UA, the
   application sends a REFER request to the UA.  This REFER MUST be sent
   to the GRUU [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>9</a>] advertised by that UA in the Contact header field of
   the dialog-initiating request or response sent by that UA.  Note that
   this REFER request creates a separate dialog between the application
   and the UA.  The Refer-To header field of the REFER request MUST
   contain an HTTP URI that references the markup document to be
   fetched.

   Furthermore, it is essential for the REFER request to be correlated
   with the dialog to which the user interface component will be
   associated.  This is necessary for authorization and for terminating
   the user interface components when the dialog terminates.  To provide
   this context, the REFER request MUST contain a Target-Dialog header
   field identifying the dialog with which the user interface component
   is associated.  As discussed in [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Request Authorization through Dialog Identification in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>10</a>], this request will also contain
   a Require header field with the tdialog option tag.

   To create a presentation-free user interface component, the
   application sends a SUBSCRIBE request to the UA.  The SUBSCRIBE MUST
   be sent to the GRUU advertised by the UA.  This SUBSCRIBE request
   creates a separate dialog.  The SUBSCRIBE request MUST use the KPML
   [<a href="#ref-8" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Key Press Stimulus (KPML)"'>8</a>] event package.  The body of the SUBSCRIBE request contains the
   markup document that defines the conditions under which the
   application wishes to be notified of user input.

   In both cases, the REFER or SUBSCRIBE request SHOULD include a
   display name in the From header field that identifies the name of the
   application.  For example, a prepaid calling card might include a
   From header field that looks like:

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1.3.%20%20Updating%20an%20Interface%20Component"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1.3" name="section-8.1.3">8.1.3</a>.  Updating an Interface Component</span>

   Once a user interface component has been created on a client, it can
   be updated.  The means for updating it depends on the type of UI
   component.

   Presentation-capable UI components are updated using techniques
   already in place for those markups.  In particular, user input will
   cause an HTTP POST operation to push the user input to the
   application.  The result of the POST operation is a new markup that
   the UI is supposed to use.  This allows the UI to be updated in
   response to user action.  Some markups, such as HTML, provide the
   ability to force a refresh after a certain period of time, so that
   the UI can be updated without user input.  Those mechanisms can be
   used here as well.  However, there is no support for an asynchronous
   push of an updated UI component from the application to the user
   agent.  A new REFER request to the same GRUU would create a new UI
   component rather than update any components already in place.

   For presentation-free UI, the story is different.  The application
   MAY update the filter at any time by generating a SUBSCRIBE refresh
   with the new filter.  The UA will immediately begin using this new
   filter.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.1.4.%20%20Terminating%20an%20Interface%20Component"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.1.4" name="section-8.1.4">8.1.4</a>.  Terminating an Interface Component</span>

   User interface components have a well-defined lifetime.  They are
   created when the component is first pushed to the client.  User
   interface components are always associated with the SIP dialog on
   which they were pushed.  As such, their lifetime is bound by the
   lifetime of the dialog.  When the dialog ends, so does the interface
   component.

   However, there are some cases where the application would like to
   terminate the user interface component before its natural termination
   point.  For presentation-capable user interfaces, this is not
   possible.  For presentation-free user interfaces, the application MAY
   terminate the component by sending a SUBSCRIBE with Expires equal to
   zero.  This terminates the subscription, which removes the UI
   component.

   A client can remove a UI component at any time.  For presentation-
   capable UI, this is analogous to the user dismissing the web form

   window.  There is no mechanism provided for reporting this kind of
   event to the application.  The application MUST be prepared to time
   out and never receive input from a user.  The duration of this
   timeout is application dependent.  For presentation-free user
   interfaces, the UA can explicitly terminate the subscription.  This
   will result in the generation of a NOTIFY with a Subscription-State
   header field equal to "terminated".

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.2.%20%20Client-Remote%20Interfaces"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2" name="section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Client-Remote Interfaces</span>

   As an alternative to, or in conjunction with client-local user
   interfaces, an application can make use of client-remote user
   interfaces.  These user interfaces can execute co-resident with the
   application itself (in which case no standardized interfaces between
   the UI and the application need to be used), or they can run
   separately.  This framework assumes that the user interface runs on a
   host that has a sufficient trust relationship with the application.
   As such, the means for instantiating the user interface is not
   considered here.

   The primary issue is to connect the user device to the remote user
   interface.  Doing so requires the manipulation of media streams
   between the client and the user interface.  Such manipulation can
   only be done by user agents.  There are two types of user agent
   applications within this framework: originating/terminating
   applications, and intermediary applications.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.2.1.%20%20Originating%20and%20Terminating%20Applications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8.2.1" name="section-8.2.1">8.2.1</a>.  Originating and Terminating Applications</span>

   Originating and terminating applications are applications that are
   themselves the originator or the final recipient of a SIP invitation.
   They are "pure" user agent applications, not back-to-back user
   agents.  The classic example of such an application is an interactive
   voice response (IVR) application, which is typically a terminating
   application.  It is a terminating application because the user
   explicitly calls it; i.e., it is the actual called party.  An example
   of an originating application is a wakeup call application, which
   calls a user at a specified time in order to wake them up.

   Because originating and terminating applications are a natural
   termination point of the dialog, manipulation of the media session by
   the application is trivial.  Traditional SIP techniques for adding
   and removing media streams, modifying codecs, and changing the
   address of the recipient of the media streams can be applied.

   Intermediary applications are, at the same time, more common than
   originating/terminating applications and more complex.  Intermediary
   applications are applications that are neither the actual caller nor
   the called party.  Rather, they represent a "third party" that wishes
   to interact with the user.  The classic example is the ubiquitous
   prepaid calling card application.

   In order for the intermediary application to add a client-remote user
   interface, it needs to manipulate the media streams of the user agent
   to terminate on that user interface.  This also introduces a
   fundamental feature interaction issue.  Since the intermediary
   application is not an actual participant in the call, the user will
   need to interact with both the intermediary application and its peer
   in the dialog.  Doing both at the same time is complicated and is
   discussed in more detail in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20%20User%20Agent%20Behavior"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>.  User Agent Behavior</span>

   In order to participate in applications that make use of stimulus
   interfaces, a user agent needs to advertise its interaction
   capabilities.

   If a user agent supports presentation-capable user interfaces, it
   MUST support the REFER method.  It MUST include, in all dialog-
   initiating requests and responses, an Allow header field that
   includes the REFER method.  The user agent MUST support the target
   dialog specification [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Request Authorization through Dialog Identification in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>10</a>], and MUST include the "tdialog" option tag
   in the Supported header field of dialog-forming requests and
   responses.  Furthermore, the UA MUST support the SIP user agent
   capabilities specification [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>6</a>].  The UA MUST be capable of being
   REFERed to an HTTP URI.  It MUST include, in the Contact header field
   of its dialog-initiating requests and responses, a "schemes" Contact
   header field parameter that includes the HTTP URI scheme.  The UA
   MUST include, in all dialog-initiating requests and responses, an
   Accept header field listing all of those markups supported by the UA.
   It is RECOMMENDED that all user agents that support presentation-
   capable user interfaces support HTML.

   If a user agent supports presentation-free user interfaces, it MUST
   support the SUBSCRIBE [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification"'>4</a>] method.  It MUST support the KPML [<a href="#ref-8" title='"A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Key Press Stimulus (KPML)"'>8</a>] event
   package.  It MUST include, in all dialog-initiating requests and
   responses, an Allow header field that includes the SUBSCRIBE method.
   It MUST include, in all dialog-initiating requests and responses, an
   Allow-Events header field that lists the KPML event package.  The UA

   MUST include, in all dialog-initiating requests and responses, an
   Accept header field listing those event filters it supports.  At a
   minimum, a UA MUST support the "application/kpml-request+xml" MIME
   type.

   For either presentation-free or presentation-capable user interfaces,
   the user agent MUST support the GRUU [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Obtaining and Using Globally Routable User Agent URIs (GRUUs) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>9</a>] specification.  The Contact
   header field in all dialog-initiating requests and responses MUST
   contain a GRUU.  The UA MUST include a Supported header field that
   contains the "gruu" option tag and the "tdialog" option tag.

   Because these headers are examined by proxies that may be executing
   applications, a UA that wishes to support client-local user
   interfaces should not encrypt them.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.2.%20%20Receiving%20User%20Interface%20Components"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.2" name="section-9.2">9.2</a>.  Receiving User Interface Components</span>

   Once the UA has created a dialog (in either the early or confirmed
   states), it MUST be prepared to receive a SUBSCRIBE or REFER request
   against its GRUU.  If the UA receives such a request prior to the
   establishment of a dialog, the UA MUST reject the request.

   A user agent SHOULD attempt to authenticate the sender of the
   request.  The sender will generally be an application; therefore, the
   user agent is unlikely to ever have a shared secret with it, making
   digest authentication useless.  However, authenticated identities can
   be obtained through other means, such as the Identity mechanism [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)"'>11</a>].

   A user agent MAY have pre-defined authorization policies that permit
   applications which have authenticated themselves with a particular
   identity to push user interface components.  If such a set of
   policies is present, it is checked first.  If the application is
   authorized, processing proceeds.

   If the application has authenticated itself but is not explicitly
   authorized or blocked, this specification RECOMMENDS that the
   application be automatically authorized if it can prove that it was
   either on the call path, or is trusted by one of the elements on the
   call path.  An application proves this to the user agent by
   demonstrating that it knows the dialog identifiers.  That occurs by
   including them in a Target-Dialog header field for REFER requests, or
   in the Event header field parameters of the KPML SUBSCRIBE request.

   Because the dialog identifiers serve as a tool for authorization, a
   user agent compliant to this framework SHOULD use dialog identifiers
   that are cryptographically random, with at least 128 bits of
   randomness.  It is recommended that this randomness be split between
   the Call-ID and From header field tags in the case of a UAC.



<span class="grey">Rosenberg                   Standards Track                    [Page 25]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5629.html">RFC 5629</a>               App Interaction Framework            October 2009</span>


   Furthermore, to ensure that only applications resident in or trusted
   by on-path elements can instantiate a user interface component, a
   user agent compliant to this specification SHOULD use the Session
   Initiation Protocol Secure (SIPS) URI scheme for all dialogs it
   initiates.  This will guarantee secure links between all the elements
   on the signaling path.

   If the dialog was not established with a SIPS URI, or the user agent
   did not choose cryptographically random dialog identifiers, then the
   application MUST NOT automatically be authorized, even if it
   presented valid dialog identifiers.  A user agent MAY apply any other
   policies in addition to (but not instead of) the ones specified here
   in order to authorize the creation of the user interface component.
   One such mechanism would be to prompt the user, informing them of the
   identity of the application and the dialog it is associated with.  If
   an authorization policy requires user interaction, the user agent
   SHOULD respond to the SUBSCRIBE or REFER request with a 202.  In the
   case of SUBSCRIBE, if authorization is not granted, the user agent
   SHOULD generate a NOTIFY to terminate the subscription.  In the case
   of REFER, the user agent MUST NOT act upon the URI in the Refer-To
   header field until user authorization is obtained.

   If an application does not present a valid dialog identifier in its
   REFER or SUBSCRIBE request, the user agent MUST reject the request
   with a 403 response.

   If a REFER request to an HTTP URI is authorized, the UA executes the
   URI and fetches the content to be rendered to the user.  This
   instantiates a presentation-capable user interface component.  If a
   SUBSCRIBE was authorized, a presentation-free user interface
   component is instantiated.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.3.%20%20Mapping%20User%20Input%20to%20User%20Interface%20Components"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.3" name="section-9.3">9.3</a>.  Mapping User Input to User Interface Components</span>

   Once the user interface components are instantiated, the user agent
   must direct user input to the appropriate component.  In the case of
   presentation-capable user interfaces, this process is known as focus
   selection.  It is done by means that are specific to the user
   interface on the device.  In the case of a PC, for example, the
   window manager would allow the user to select the appropriate user
   interface component to which their input is directed.

   For presentation-free user interfaces, the situation is more
   complicated.  In some cases, the device may support a mechanism that
   allows the user to select a "line", and thus the associated dialog.
   Any user input on the keypad while this line is selected are fed to
   the user interface components associated with that dialog.

   Otherwise, for client-local user interfaces, the user input is
   assumed to be associated with all user interface components.  For
   client-remote user interfaces, the user device converts the user
   input to media, typically conveyed using <a href="rfc4733.html">RFC 4733</a>, and sends this to
   the client-remote user interface.  This user interface then needs to
   map user input from potentially many media streams into user
   interface events.  The process for doing this is described in
   <a href="#section-7.3">Section 7.3</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.4.%20%20Receiving%20Updates%20to%20User%20Interface%20Components"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9.4" name="section-9.4">9.4</a>.  Receiving Updates to User Interface Components</span>

   For presentation-capable user interfaces, updates to the user
   interface occur in ways specific to that user interface component.
   In the case of HTML, for example, the document can tell the client to
   fetch a new document periodically.  However, this framework does not
   provide any additional machinery to asynchronously push a new user
   interface component to the client.

   For presentation-free user interfaces, an application can push an
   update to a component by sending a SUBSCRIBE refresh with a new
   filter.  The user agent will process these according to the rules of
   the event package.

   Termination of a presentation-capable user interface component is a
   trivial procedure.  The user agent merely dismisses the window (or
   its equivalent).  The fact that the component is dismissed is not
   communicated to the application.  As such, it is purely a local
   matter.

   In the case of a presentation-free user interface, the user might
   wish to cease interacting with the application.  However, most
   presentation-free user interfaces will not have a way for the user to
   signal this through the device.  If such a mechanism did exist, the
   UA SHOULD generate a NOTIFY request with a Subscription-State header
   field equal to "terminated" and a reason of "rejected".  This tells
   the application that the component has been removed and that it
   should not attempt to re-subscribe.

   The inter-application feature interaction problem is inherent to
   stimulus signaling.  Whenever there are multiple applications, there
   are multiple user interfaces.  The system has to determine to which
   user interface any particular input is destined.  That question is
   the essence of the inter-application feature interaction problem.

   Inter-application feature interaction is not an easy problem to
   resolve.  For now, we consider separately the issues for client-local
   and client-remote user interface components.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.1.%20%20Client-Local%20UI"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10.1" name="section-10.1">10.1</a>.  Client-Local UI</span>

   When the user interface itself resides locally on the client device,
   the feature interaction problem is actually much simpler.  The end
   device knows explicitly about each application, and therefore can
   present the user with each one separately.  When the user provides
   input, the client device can determine to which user interface the
   input is destined.  The user interface to which input is destined is
   referred to as the "application in focus", and the means by which the
   focused application is selected is called "focus determination".

   Generally speaking, focus determination is purely a local operation.
   In the PC universe, focus determination is provided by window
   managers.  Each application does not know about focus; it merely
   receives the user input that has been targeted to it when it's in
   focus.  This basic concept applies to SIP-based applications as well.

   Focus determination will frequently be trivial, depending on the user
   interface type.  Consider a user that makes a call from a PC.  The
   call passes through a prepaid calling card application and a call-
   recording application.  Both of these wish to interact with the user.
   Both push an HTML-based user interface to the user.  On the PC, each
   user interface would appear as a separate window.  The user interacts
   with the call-recording application by selecting its window, and with
   the prepaid calling card application by selecting its window.  Focus
   determination is literally provided by the PC window manager.  It is
   clear to which application the user input is targeted.

   As another example, consider the same two applications, but on a
   "smart phone" that has a set of buttons, and next to each button,
   there is an LCD display that can provide the user with an option.
   This user interface can be represented using the Wireless Markup
   Language (WML), for example.

   The phone would allocate some number of buttons to each application.
   The prepaid calling card would get one button for its "hangup"
   command, and the recording application would get one for its "start/
   stop" command.  The user can easily determine which application to
   interact with by pressing the appropriate button.  Pressing a button
   determines focus and provides user input, both at the same time.

   Unfortunately, not all devices will have these advanced displays.  A
   PSTN gateway, or a basic IP telephone, may only have a 12-key keypad.
   The user interfaces for these devices are provided through the Keypad



<span class="grey">Rosenberg                   Standards Track                    [Page 28]</span></pre>

   Markup Language (KPML).  Considering once again the feature
   interaction case above, the prepaid calling card application and the
   call-recording application would both pass a KPML document to the
   device.  When the user presses a button on the keypad, to which
   document does the input apply?  The device does not allow the user to
   select.  A device where the user cannot provide focus is called a
   "focusless device".  This is quite a hard problem to solve.  This
   framework does not make any explicit normative recommendation, but it
   concludes that the best option is to send the input to both user
   interfaces unless the markup in one interface has indicated that it
   should be suppressed from others.  This is a sensible choice by
   analogy -- it's exactly what the existing circuit-switched telephone
   network will do.  It is an explicit non-goal to provide a better
   mechanism for feature interaction resolution than the PSTN on devices
   that have the same user interface as they do on the PSTN.  Devices
   with better displays, such as PCs or screen phones, can benefit from
   the capabilities of this framework, allowing the user to determine
   which application they are interacting with.

   Indeed, when a user provides input on a focusless device, the input
   must be passed to all client-local user interfaces AND all client-
   remote user interfaces, unless the markup tells the UI to suppress
   the media.  In the case of KPML, key events are passed to remote user
   interfaces by encoding them as described in <a href="rfc4733.html">RFC 4733</a> [<a href="#ref-19" title='"RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals"'>19</a>].  Of
   course, since a client cannot determine whether or not a media stream
   terminates in a remote user interface, these key events are passed in
   all audio media streams unless the KPML request document is used to
   suppress them.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.2.%20%20Client-Remote%20UI"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10.2" name="section-10.2">10.2</a>.  Client-Remote UI</span>

   When the user interfaces run remotely, the determination of focus can
   be much, much harder.  There are many architectures that can be
   deployed to handle the interaction.  None are ideal.  However, all
   are beyond the scope of this specification.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.%20%20Intra%20Application%20Feature%20Interaction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11" name="section-11">11</a>.  Intra Application Feature Interaction</span>

   An application can instantiate a multiplicity of user interface
   components.  For example, a single application can instantiate two
   separate HTML components and one WML component.  Furthermore, an
   application can instantiate both client-local and client-remote user
   interfaces.

   The feature interaction issues between these components within the
   same application are less severe.  If an application has multiple
   client user interface components, their interaction is resolved
   identically to the inter-application case -- through focus

   determination.  However, the problems in focusless user devices (such
   as a keypad on a telephone) generally won't exist, since the
   application can generate user interfaces that do not overlap in their
   usage of an input.

   The real issue is that the optimal user experience frequently
   requires some kind of coupling between the differing user interface
   components.  This is a classic problem in multi-modal user
   interfaces, such as those described by Speech Application Language
   Tags (SALT).  As an example, consider a user interface where a user
   can either press a labeled button to make a selection, or listen to a
   prompt, and speak the desired selection.  Ideally, when the user
   presses the button, the prompt should cease immediately, since both
   of them were targeted at collecting the same information in parallel.
   Such interactions are best handled by markups that natively support
   such interactions, such as SALT, and thus require no explicit support
   from this framework.

   This section shows the operation of a call-recording application.
   This application allows a user to record the media in their call by
   clicking on a button in a web form.  The application uses a
   presentation-capable user interface component that is pushed to the
   caller.  The conventions of [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Torture Test Messages"'>17</a>] are used to describe representation

   First, the caller, A, sends an INVITE to set up a call (message 1).
   Since the caller supports the framework and can handle presentation-
   capable user interface components, it includes the Supported header
   field indicating that the GRUU extension and the Target-Dialog header
   field are understood, the Allow header field indicating that REFER is
   understood, and the Contact header field that includes the "schemes"
   header field parameter.

   The REFER request contained a Target-Dialog header field parameter
   with a valid dialog identifier.  Furthermore, all of the signaling
   was over TLS and the dialog identifiers contain sufficient
   randomness.  As such, the caller, A, automatically authorizes the
   application.  It then acts on the Refer-To URI, fetching the script
   from app.example.com (message 11).  The response, message 12,
   contains a web application that the user can click on to enable
   recording.  Because the client executed the URL in the Refer-To, it
   generates another NOTIFY to the application, informing it of the
   successful response (message 13).  This is answered with a 200 OK
   (message 14).  When the user clicks on the link (message 15), the
   results are posted to the server, and an updated display is provided
   (message 16).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/13.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-13" name="section-13">13</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   There are many security considerations associated with this
   framework.  It allows applications in the network to instantiate user
   interface components on a client device.  Such instantiations need to
   be from authenticated applications, and also need to be authorized to
   place a UI into the client.  Indeed, the stronger requirement is
   authorization.  It is not as important to know the name of the
   provider of the application, as it is to know that the provider is
   authorized to instantiate components.

   This specification defines specific authorization techniques and
   requirements.  Automatic authorization is granted if the application
   can prove that it is on the call path, or is trusted by an element on
   the call path.  As documented above, this can be accomplished by the
   use of cryptographically random dialog identifiers and the usage of
   SIPS for message confidentiality.  It is RECOMMENDED that SIPS be
   implemented by user agents compliant to this specification.  This
   does not represent a change from the requirements in <a href="rfc3261.html">RFC 3261</a>.
