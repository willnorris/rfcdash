Abstract

   This document is one of a set of documents that together describe all
   aspects of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).  IPP is an
   application-level protocol that can be used for distributed printing
   on the Internet.  There are multiple parts to IPP, but the primary
   architectural components are the Model, the Protocol, and an
   interface to Directory Services.  This document provides a statement
   of the requirements for notifications as an optional part of an IPP
   Service.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document is one of a set of documents that together describe all
   aspects of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP).  IPP is an
   application level protocol that can be used for distributed printing
   on the Internet.  There are multiple parts to IPP, but the primary
   architectural components are the Model, the Protocol, and an
   interface to Directory Services.  This document provides a statement
   of the requirements for notifications as an optional part of an IPP
   Service.  See <a href="#section-10">section 10</a> for a description of the base IPP documents.

   The scope of this requirements document covers functionality used by
   the following kinds of IPP Users: End Users, Print Administrators,
   and Operators.  See [<a href="rfc3995.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol (IPP): Event Notifications and Subscriptions"'>RFC3995</a>] for the extensions to the Internet
   Printing Protocol/1.0 (IPP) [<a href="rfc2565.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Encoding and Transport"'>RFC2565</a>], [<a href="rfc2566.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2566</a>], IPP/1.1 [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>],
   [<a href="rfc2910.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport"'>RFC2910</a>], and future versions.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   It is necessary to define a set of terms to be able to clearly
   express the requirements for notification services in an IPP System.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Job-Submitting%20End%20User"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Job-Submitting End User</span>

   A human end user who submits a print job to an IPP Printer.  This
   person may or may not be within the same security domain as the
   Printer.  This person may or may not be geographically near the
   printer.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20Administrator"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  Administrator</span>

   A human user who established policy for and configures the print
   system.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.%20%20Operator"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Operator</span>

   A human user who carries out the policy established by the
   Administrator and controls the day-to-day running of the print
   system.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.%20%20Job-Submitting%20Application"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" name="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  Job-Submitting Application</span>

   An application (for example, a batch application), acting on behalf
   of a Job Submitting End User, that submits a print job to an IPP
   Printer.  The application may or may not be within the same security
   domain as the Printer.  This application may or may not be
   geographically near the printer.




<span class="grey">Hastings, et al.             Informational                      [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-3" id="page-3" name="page-3"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3997.html">RFC 3997</a>             IPP: Notification Requirements           March 2005</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.5.%20%20Security%20Domain"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.5" name="section-2.5">2.5</a>.  Security Domain</span>

   For the purposes of this discussion, the set of network components
   that can communicate without going through a proxy or firewall.  A
   security domain may be geographically very large; for example,
   anywhere within example.com.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.6.%20%20IPP%20Client"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.6" name="section-2.6">2.6</a>.  IPP Client</span>

   The software component that sends IPP requests to an IPP Printer
   object and accepts IPP responses from an IPP Printer.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.7.%20%20Job%20Recipient"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.7" name="section-2.7">2.7</a>.  Job Recipient</span>

   A human who is the ultimate consumer of the print job.  In many cases
   this will be the same person as the Job-Submitting End User, but this
   need not always be the case.  For example, if I use IPP to print a
   document on a printer in a business partner's office, I am the Job-
   Submitting End User, and the person whom I intend the document for in
   my business partner's office is the Job Recipient.  Since one of the
   goals of IPP is to be able to print near the Job Recipient, we would
   normally expect that person to be in the same security domain as, and
   geographically near, the Printer.  However, this may not always be
   the case.  For example, I submit a print job across the Internet to a
   XYZ's print shop.  I am both the Submitting End User and the Job
   Recipient, but I am neither near nor in the same security domain as
   the Printer.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.8.%20%20Job%20Recipient%20Proxy"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.8" name="section-2.8">2.8</a>.  Job Recipient Proxy</span>

   A person acting on behalf of the Job Recipient.  The Job Recipient
   Proxy physically picks up the printed document from the Printer if
   the Job Recipient cannot do so.  The Proxy is by definition
   geographically near and in the same security domain as the printer.
   For example, I submit a print job from home to be printed on a
   printer at work.  I'd like my secretary to pick up the print job and
   put it on my desk.  In this case,  I am acting as both a Job-
   Submitting End User and a Job Recipient.  My secretary is acting as a
   Job Recipient Proxy.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.9.%20%20Notification%20Subscriber"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.9" name="section-2.9">2.9</a>.  Notification Subscriber</span>

   A client that requests the IPP Printer to send Event Notifications to
   one or more Notification Recipients.  A Notification Subscriber may

   The entity that sends Event Notifications.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.11.%20%20Notification%20Recipient"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.11" name="section-2.11">2.11</a>.  Notification Recipient</span>

   The entity that receives IPP Notifications about Job and/or Printer
   events.  A Notification Recipient may be a Job Submitting End User, a
   Job-Submitting Application, a Job Recipient, a Job Recipient Proxy,
   an Operator, an Administrator, etc., and his or her representative,
   log file, usage statistics-gathering application, or other active or
   passive entities.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.12.%20%20Notification%20Recipient%20Agent"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.12" name="section-2.12">2.12</a>.  Notification Recipient Agent</span>

   A program that receives Event Notifications on behalf of the
   Notification Recipient.  The agent may take some action on behalf of
   the recipient, forward the notification to the recipient via some
   alternative means (for example, page the recipient), or queue the
   notification for later retrieval by the recipient.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.13.%20%20Event"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.13" name="section-2.13">2.13</a>.  Event</span>

   An Event is an occurrence (either expected or unexpected) within the
   printing system of a change of state, condition, or configuration of
   a Job or Printer object.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.14.%20%20Event%20Notification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.14" name="section-2.14">2.14</a>.  Event Notification</span>

   When an event occurs, an Event Notification is generated that fully
   describes the event (what the event was, where it occurred, when it
   occurred, etc.).  Event Notifications are delivered to all the
   Notification Recipients that are subscribed to that Event, if any.
   The Event Notification is delivered to the address of the
   Notification Recipient by using the notification delivery method
   defined in the subscription.  However, an Event Notification is sent
   ONLY if there is a corresponding subscription.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.15.%20%20Notification%20Subscription"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.15" name="section-2.15">2.15</a>.  Notification Subscription</span>

   A Notification Subscription is a request by a Notification Subscriber
   to the IPP Printer to send Event Notifications to specified
   Notification Recipient(s) when an event occurs.

   IPP Objects (for example, a print job) from which notification are
   being sent may have associated attributes.  A user may want to have
   one or more of these returned along with a particular notification.
   In general, these may include any attribute associated with the
   object emitting the notification.  Examples include the following:

     number-of-intervening jobs
     job-k-octets
     job-k-octets processed
     job impressions
     job-impressions-interpreted
     job-impressions-completed
     impressionsCompletedCurrentCopy (job MIB)
     sheetCompletedCopyNumber (job MIB)
     sheetsCompletedDocumentNumber (job MIB)
     Copies-requested
     Copy-type
     Output-destination
     Job-state-reasons
     Job ID
     Printer URI
     Subscription ID (for job independent subscription)

   Event Notifications are delivered by using a Delivery Method.  An
   example of a Delivery Method is email.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.18.%20%20Immediate%20Notification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.18" name="section-2.18">2.18</a>.  Immediate Notification</span>

   Notifications sent to the Notification Recipient or the Notification
   Recipient's agent in such a way that the notification arrives
   immediately, within the limits of common addressing, routing, network
   congestion, and quality of service.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.19.%20%20Store-and-Forward%20Notification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.19" name="section-2.19">2.19</a>.  Store-and-Forward Notification</span>

   Notifications that are not necessarily delivered to Notification
   Recipients immediately but are queued for delivery by an intermediate
   network application, for later retrieval.  Email is an example of a
   store-and-forward notification delivery method.

   Notifications that are delivered by a reliable delivery of packets or
   character stream, with acknowledgement and retry, so that delivery of
   the notification is guaranteed within determinate time limits.  For
   example, if the Notification Recipient has logged off and gone home
   for the day, an immediate notification cannot be guaranteed, even
   when sent over a reliable transport, because there is nothing there
   to catch it.  Guaranteed delivery requires both store-and-forward
   notification and a reliable transport.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.21.%20%20Notification%20over%20Unreliable%20Transport"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.21" name="section-2.21">2.21</a>.  Notification over Unreliable Transport</span>

   Notifications are delivered via the fundamental transport address and
   routing framework, but no acknowledgement or retry is required.
   Process-to-process communications, if involved, are unconstrained.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.22.%20%20Human-Consumable%20Notification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.22" name="section-2.22">2.22</a>.  Human-Consumable Notification</span>

   Notifications intended to be consumed by human end users only.  Email
   would be an example of a Human-Consumable Notification, though it
   could also contain Machine-Consumable Notification.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.23.%20%20Machine-Consumable%20Notification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.23" name="section-2.23">2.23</a>.  Machine-Consumable Notification</span>

   Notifications that are intended for consumption by a program only,
   such as an IPP Client.  Machine-Consumable Notifications may not
   contain human-readable information.  Do we need both human and
   machine? Machine readable is intended for application-to-application
   only.  The Notification Recipient could process the machine-readable
   Event Notification into human-readable format.

   1.   Sitting in my office, I submit a print job to the printer down
        the hall.  I am in the same security domain as the printer and,
        of course, geographically near.  I want to know immediately when
        my print job will be completed (or if there is a problem)
        because the document I am working on is urgent.  I submit the
        print job with the following attributes:

        -  Notification Recipient: Me
        -  Notification Events: All
        -  Notification Attributes: Job-state-reason
        -  Notification Type: Immediate

   2.   Working from home, I submit a print job to the same printer as
        in the previous example.  However, I am not at work, I cannot
        physically get the print file or do anything with it.  It can
        wait until I get to work this afternoon.  However, I'd like my
        secretary to pick up the output and put it on my desk so that it
        doesn't get lost or misfiled.  I'd also like a store-and-forward
        notification sent to my email so that when I get to work I can
        tell whether there was a problem with the print job.  I submit a
        print job with the following attributes:

        -  Notification Recipient: My secretary
        -  Notification Events: Print complete
        -  Notification Type: Immediate

        -  Notification Recipient:  Me
        -  Notification Events:  Print complete
        -  Notification Attributes:  Impressions completed
        -  Notification Type: Store and forward

   3.   Sitting in my office, I submit a print job to a client at an
        engineering firm my company works with on a daily basis.  The
        engineering firm is in Belgium.  I would like my client to know
        when the print job is complete so that she can pick it up from
        the printer in her building.  It is important that she review it
        right away and send her comments back to me.  I submit the print
        job with the following attributes:

        -  Notification Recipient: Client at engineering firm
        -  Notification Events: Print complete
        -  Notification Type: Immediate
        -  Notification Language: French

   4.   From a hotel room, I send a print job to a Kinko's store in the
        town I am working in, in order to get a printed report for the
        meeting I am attending in the morning.  As I'm going out to
        dinner after I get this job submitted, an immediate notification
        won't do me much good.  However, I'd like to check in the
        morning before I drive to the Kinko's store to see whether the
        file has been printed.  An email notification is sufficient for
        this purpose.  I submit the print job with the following
        attributes:

        -  Notification Recipient: Me
        -  Notification Events: Print complete
        -  Notification Type: Store and forward

   5.   I am printing a large, complex print file.  I want to have some
        immediate feedback on the progress of the print job as it
        prints.  I submit the print job with the following attributes:

        -  Notification Recipient: Me
        -  Notification Type: Immediate
        -  Notification Events:  All state transitions
        -  Notification Attributes: Impression completed

   6.   I am an operator and one of my duties is to keep the printer
        running.  I subscribe independently from a job submission so
        that my subscription outlasts any particular job.  I subscribe
        with the following attributes:

        -  Notification Recipient: Me
        -  Notification Type: Immediate
        -  Notification Events: All Printer state transitions
        -  Notification Attributes: Printer state, printer state
           reasons, device powering up, device powering down

   7.   I am a usage statistics gathering application.  I subscribe
        independently from a job submission so that my subscription
        outlasts any particular job.  My subscription may persist across
        power cycles.  I subscribe with the following attributes:

        -  Notification Recipient: Me
        -  Notification Type: Immediate
        -  Notification Events: Job completion
        -  Notification Attributes: Impression completed, sheets
           completed, time submitted, time started, time completed, job
           owner, job size in octets, etc.

   8.   I am a client application program that displays a list of jobs
        currently queued for printing on a printer.  I display the
        "job-name", "job-state", "job-state-reasons", "page-count", and
        "intervening-jobs", either for the user's jobs or for all jobs.
        The window displaying the job list remains open for an
        independent amount of time, and it is desired that it represent
        the current state of the queue.  It is desired that the
        application only perform a slow poll in order to recover from
        any missed notifications.  So the event delivery mechanism
        provides the means to update the screen on all needed changes,
        including querying for some attributes that may not be delivered
        in the Notification.

   9.   I am a client application program that displays a list of
        printers.  For each Printer, I display the current state and
        configuration.  The window displaying the printer list remains
        open for an independent amount of time, and it is desired that
        it represent the current state of each printer.  It is desired
        that the application only need to perform a slow poll in order
        to recover from any missed notifications.  So the event delivery
        mechanism provides the means to update the screen on all needed
        changes, including querying for some attributes that may not be
        delivered in the Notification.

   10.  I am an IPP Server that controls one or more devices and that
        implements an IPP Printer object to represent each device.  I
        want to support IPP Notification for each of the IPP Printer
        objects that I implement.  Many of these devices do not support
        notification (or IPP).  So I need to support the IPP
        Notification semantics specified for each IPP Printer object
        myself on behalf of each of the devices that each of the IPP
        Printer objects represents.  When I accept an IPP job creation
        requests, I convert it to what the device will accept.  In some
        cases, I must poll the devices in order to be informed of their
        job and device state and state changes to be able to send IPP
        Notifications to subscribed Notification Recipients.

   11.  I am an IPP Server that controls one or more devices and that
        implements an IPP Printer object to represent each device.  I
        want to support IPP Notification for each of the IPP Printer
        objects that I implement.  These devices all support IPP,
        including IPP Notification.  I would like the design choice for
        supporting IPP Notification for these objects either (1) by
        forwarding the notification to the IPP Printers that I, alone,
        control and have them send the notifications to the intended
        Notification Recipients without my involvement, or (2) by
        replacing the notification submitted with the Job to indicate me
        as the Notification Recipient; in turn I will forward
        Notifications to the Notification Recipients requested by my
        clients.  Most of the rest of the contents of the IPP Job I send
        to the IPP Printers I control will be the same as those that I
        receive from my IPP clients.

   12.  I am an IPP Server that controls one or more devices and that
        implements an IPP Printer object to represent each device.  I
        want to support IPP Notification for each of the IPP Printer
        objects that I implement.  These devices all support IPP,
        including IPP Notification.  Because these IPP Printers MAY also
        be controlled by other servers (using IPP or other protocols), I
        only want job events for the jobs that I send, but I do want
        Printer events all the time, so that I can show proper Printer

        state to my clients.  So I subscribe to these IPP Printers for
        Printer events with a long-standing subscription, with myself as
        the Notification Recipient.  When I get a Job Creation request,
        I decide to which IPP Printer to send the job.  When I do so, I
        also add a job subscription for Job events, with me as the
        Notification Recipient to the job's job subscriptions supplied
        by my clients (this usage is called "piggybacking").  These IPP
        Printers automatically remove their job subscriptions when the
        job finishes, as for all job subscriptions, so that I no longer
        get Job events when my jobs are completed.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Requirements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Requirements</span>

   The following requirements are intended to be met by the IPP
   Notification specification (not the implementation).  The following
   are true for the resulting IPP Notification Specification document:

   1.  It must indicate which of these requirements are REQUIRED and
       which are OPTIONAL for a conforming implementation to support.
       See <a href="rfc2911.html#section-12.1">[RFC2911], section 12.1</a>, for the definition of these
       important conformance terms.

   2.  It must be designed so that an IPP Printer can transparently
       support the IPP Notification semantics by using third-party
       notification services that exist today or that may be
       standardized in the future.

   3.  It must define a means for a Job-Submitting End User to specify
       zero or more Notification Recipients when submitting a print job.
       A Submitter will not be able to prevent out-of-band subscriptions
       from authorized persons, such as Operators.

   4.  It must define a means, when specifying a Notification Recipient,
       for a Notification Subscriber to specify one or more notification
       events for that Notification Recipient, subject to administrative
       and security policy restrictions.  Any of the following
       constitute Job or Printer Events for which a Job Submitting End
       User can specify that notifications be sent:

       -  Any standard Printer MIB alert
       -  Job Received (transition from Unknown to Pending)
       -  Job Started (transition from Pending to Processing)
       -  Page Complete (page is stacked)
       -  Collated Copy Complete (last sheet of collated copy is
          stacked)

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3997.html">RFC 3997</a>             IPP: Notification Requirements           March 2005</span>


       -  Job Complete (transition from Processing or Processing-stopped
          to Completed)
       -  Job Aborted (transition from Pending, Pending-held,
       -  Processing, or Processing-stopped to Aborted)
       -  Job Canceled (transition from Pending, Pending-held,
       -  Processing, or Processing-held to Canceled)
       -  Other job state changes, such as paused, purged
       -  Device problems for which the job is destined
       -  Job (interpreter) issues

   5.   It must define how an End User or Operator subscribes for

        -  any set of Job Events for a specific job, or
        -  any set of Printer Events while a specific job is not
           complete.

   6.   It must define how an End User or Operator subscribes for the
        following without having to submit a Job:

        -  Any set of Printer Events for a defined period.
        -  Any set of Job Events for all jobs, with no control over
           which jobs.

   7.   It must define how the Notification Subscriber is able to
        specify either immediate or store-and-forward notification
        independently for each Notification Recipient.  The means may be
        explicit, or implied by the method of delivery chosen by the Job
        Submitting End User.

   8.   It must define common delivery methods: e.g., email.

   9.   It must define how an IPP Printer validates its ability to
        deliver an Event by using the specified delivery scheme.  If it
        does not support the specified scheme, or if the specified
        scheme is invalid for some reason, then the IPP Printer accepts
        and performs the request anyway and indicates the unsupported
        attribute values.  There is no requirement for the IPP Printer
        receiving the print request to validate the identity of a
        Notification Recipient, or the ability of the system to deliver
        an event to that recipient as requested (for example, if the
        Notification Recipient is not at work today).

   10.  It must define a class of IPP event notification delivery
        methods that can flow through corporate firewalls.  However, an

   11.  It may define a means to deliver a notification to the
        submitting client when the delivery of an event notification to
        a specified Notification Recipient fails.  A fallback means of
        subscribers to determine whether notifications have failed
        (i.e., polling) may be provided.

   12.  It must define a mechanism for localizing Human-Consumable
        Notifications by the Notification Source.

   13.  It may define a way to specify whether event delivery requires
        acknowledgement back to the Notification Source.

   14.  There must be a mechanism defined so that job-independent
        subscriptions do not become stale and do not require human
        intervention to be removed.  However, a subscription must not be
        deemed stale only if it is unable to deliver an Event
        Notification, as temporary Notification delivery problems must
        be tolerated.

   15.  A mechanism must be defined so that an Event Subscriber is able
        to add an Event Subscription to a Job after the Job has been
        submitted.

   16.  A mechanism must be defined so that a client is able to cancel
        an Event Subscription on a job or printer after the job has been
        submitted.

   17.  A mechanism must be defined so that a client can obtain the set
        of current Subscriptions.

   By far the biggest security concern is the abuse of notification:
   sending unwanted notifications sent to third parties (i.e., spam).
   The problem is made worse by notification addresses that may be
   redistributed to multiple parties (e.g., mailing lists).  Scenarios
   exist in which third-party notification is required (see scenarios 2
   and 3).  The fully secure solution would require active agreement of
   all recipients before anything is sent out.  However, requirement 9
   ("There is no requirement for an IPP Printer receiving the print
   request to validate the identity of an event recipient") argues
   against this.  Certain systems may decide to disallow third-party
   notifications (a traditional fax model).

   The same security issues are present when Clients submit notification
   requests to the IPP Printer as when they submit an IPP/1.1 print job
   request.  The same mechanisms used by IPP/1.1 can therefore be used

   by the client notification submission.  Operations that require
   authentication can use the HTTP authentication.  Operations that
   require privacy can use the HTTP/TLS privacy.

   The notification access control model should be similar to the IPP
   access control model.  Creating a notification subscription is
   associated with a user.  Only the creator or an operator can cancel
   the subscription.  The system may limit the listing of items to items
   owned by the user.  Some subscriptions (e.g., those that have a
   lifetime longer than a job) can be done only by privileged users
   (operators and/or administrators), if that is the authorization
   policy.

   The standard security concerns (delivery to the right user, privacy
   of content, tamper-proof content) apply to the notification delivery.
   IPP should use the security mechanism of the delivery method used.
   Some delivery mechanisms are more secure than others.  Therefore,
   sensitive notifications should use the delivery method that has the
   strongest security.

   The Human-Consumable Notification must be localized to the natural
   language and charset that Notification Subscriber specifies within
   the choice of natural languages and charsets that the IPP Printer
   supports.

   The Machine-Consumable Notification data uses the "application/ipp"
   MIME media type.  It contains attributes whose text values are
   required to be in the natural language and charset that the
   Notification Subscriber specifies within the choice of natural
   languages and charsets that the IPP Printer supports.  See [<a href="rfc2566.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2566</a>].

   The base set of IPP documents includes the following:

      Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol [<a href="rfc2567.html" title='"Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol"'>RFC2567</a>]
      Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the
        Internet Printing Protocol [<a href="rfc2568.html" title='"Rationale for the Structure of the Model and Protocol for the Internet Printing Protocol"'>RFC2568</a>]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport [<a href="rfc2910.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport"'>RFC2910</a>]
      Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer's Guide [<a href="rfc3196.html">RFC3196</a>]
      Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols [<a href="rfc2569.html" title='"Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols"'>RFC2569</a>]

   "Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol" takes a broad look
   at distributed printing functionality, and it enumerates real-life
   scenarios that help clarify the features that need to be included in
   a printing protocol for the Internet.  It identifies requirements for
   three types of users: end users, operators, and administrators.  It
   calls out a subset of end-user requirements that are satisfied in
   IPP/1.0 [<a href="rfc2566.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2566</a>], [<a href="rfc2565.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.0: Encoding and Transport"'>RFC2565</a>].  A few OPTIONAL operator operations
   have been added to IPP/1.1 [<a href="rfc2911.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"'>RFC2911</a>], [<a href="rfc2910.html" title='"Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport"'>RFC2910</a>].

   "Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the Internet
   Printing Protocol" describes IPP from a high-level view, defines a
   roadmap for the various documents that form the suite of IPP
   specification documents, and gives background and rationale for the
   IETF IPP working group's major decisions.

   "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics" describes a
   simplified model with abstract objects, their attributes, and their
   operations.  The model introduces a Printer and a Job.  The Job
   supports multiple documents per Job.  The model document also
   addresses security, internationalization, and directory issues.

   "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport" is a formal
   mapping of the abstract operations and attributes defined in the
   model document onto HTTP/1.1 [<a href="rfc2616.html">RFC2616</a>].  It also defines the encoding
   rules for a new Internet MIME media type called "application/ipp".
   This document also defines the rules for transporting over HTTP a
   message body whose Content-Type is "application/ipp".  This document
   defines the "ipp" scheme for identifying IPP printers and jobs.

   "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer's Guide" gives insight
   and advice to implementers of IPP clients and IPP objects.  It is
   intended to help them understand IPP/1.1 and some of the
   considerations that may assist them in the design of their client
   and/or IPP object implementations.  For example, a typical order of
   processing requests is given, including error checking.  Motivation
   for some of the specification decisions is also included.

   "Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols" gives some advice to
   implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer Daemon )
   implementations.
