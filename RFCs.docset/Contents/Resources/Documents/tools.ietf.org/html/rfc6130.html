<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document describes a neighborhood discovery protocol (NHDP) for
   a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) [<a href="rfc2501.html" title='"Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET): Routing Protocol Performance Issues and Evaluation Considerations"'>RFC2501</a>].  This protocol uses a
   local exchange of HELLO messages so that each router can determine
   the presence of, and connectivity to, its 1-hop and symmetric 2-hop
   neighbors.  Messages are defined and sent in packets according to the
   specification [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>].

   1-hop neighborhood information is recorded for use by MANET routing
   protocols to determine direct (1-hop) connectivity to neighboring
   routers. 2-hop symmetric neighborhood information is recorded so as
   to enable MANET routing protocols to employ flooding reduction
   techniques, e.g., to select reduced relay sets for efficient network-
   wide traffic dissemination.

   1-hop and symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information is recorded in the
   form of Information Bases.  These are available for use by other
   protocols, such as MANET routing protocols, that require information
   regarding the local network connectivity.  This protocol is designed
   to maintain the information in these Information Bases even in the
   presence of a dynamic network topology and wireless communication
   channel characteristics.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6130.html">RFC 6130</a>                       MANET-NHDP                     April 2011</span>


   This protocol makes no assumptions about the underlying link layer,
   other than support of local broadcast or multicast for communication
   to 1-hop neighbor routers.  Link-layer information may be used if
   available and applicable.

   This protocol is based on the neighborhood discovery process
   contained in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) Protocol
   [<a href="rfc3626.html" title='"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)"'>RFC3626</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Motivation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Motivation</span>

   MANETs differ from more traditional wired and infrastructure-based
   wireless networks due to their envisioned applicability over more
   challenging communication channels (e.g., wireless, lossy, broadcast
   channels with moderate and shared bandwidth, hidden and exposed
   terminals, and interference from other network devices and the
   environment) and in more challenging topological conditions (e.g.,
   rapid and unpredictable mobility, dynamic and non-predetermined
   network membership).

   Due to the properties of wireless transmissions, communication
   between two neighboring routers may not be bi-directional; even if
   router A is able to receive packets from router B, the converse is
   not guaranteed to be true.  Furthermore, because of the localized
   nature of wireless broadcast communication, neighboring routers
   within the same communications channel may have different sets of
   neighbors.  That is, when using the same communication channel, even
   if router A is able to exchange packets with router B, and router B
   is able to exchange packets with router C, this does not guarantee
   that router A and router C can exchange packets directly.

   Each router in a MANET may use more than one communication channel.
   In particular, between the same pair of routers, more than one
   distinct communication channel may exist, each with different
   properties.  This may, for example, be the case where MANET routers
   are equipped with multiple distinct wireless interfaces, operating at
   different frequencies.

   For use by MANET routing protocols, as well as for establishing a
   router's neighbors, a router may also need to determine whether each
   communication channel with that neighbor is bi-directional.

   The set of neighbor routers of a given MANET router may be
   continuously changing, often due to router mobility or a changing
   physical environment in which the MANET is located.  There is
   typically no information from lower layers that would enable an IP
   routing protocol to detect and, as appropriate, react to such
   changes.  Such changes can often take place on a short timescale,

   such as of the order of seconds, requiring MANET routing protocols to
   act rapidly to ensure suitable convergence properties.

   MANET routing protocols, for example [<a href="rfc3626.html" title='"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)"'>RFC3626</a>] and [<a href="rfc5449.html" title='"OSPF Multipoint Relay (MPR) Extension for Ad Hoc Networks"'>RFC5449</a>], often
   employ relay set reductions in order to conserve network capacity
   when maintaining network-wide topological information, with
   calculation of these reduced relay sets employing up to two hop
   information.

   The neighborhood discovery protocol specified in this document
   provides continued tracking of neighborhood changes, link bi-
   directionality, and local topological information up to two hops.
   Combined, this allows a MANET routing protocol access to information
   describing link establishment/disappearance and provides the
   necessary topological information for reduced relay set selection and
   other purposes.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   All terms introduced in [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>], including "packet", "message",
   "Address Block", "TLV Block", "TLV", "address", "address prefix", and
   "address object" are to be interpreted as described therein.

   Additionally, this document uses the following terminology:

   Network Address:
      An address plus an associated prefix length.  This may be an
      address with an associated maximum prefix length or an address
      prefix including a prefix length.  A network address thus
      represents a range of addresses.

   Router:
      A MANET router that implements this neighborhood discovery
      protocol.

   Interface:
      A router's attachment to a communications medium.  An interface is
      assigned one or more addresses.

   MANET interface:
      An interface participating in a MANET and using this neighborhood
      discovery protocol.  A router may have several MANET interfaces.

   Furthermore, this document uses the following notational conventions:

   X contains y, or y is contained in X
      An unordered list membership operator.  X is an unordered list and
      y is an element.  "X contains y" or "y is contained in X" returns
      true if the unordered list X includes the element y, and returns
      false otherwise.

   X contains Y, or Y is contained in X
      An unordered list inclusion operator.  X and Y are both unordered
      lists.  "X contains Y" or "Y is contained in X" returns true if
      the unordered list X contains all elements y which are contained
      in Y, and returns false otherwise.

   A overlaps B
      If A and B are network addresses, and the range of addresses
      represented by A and the range of addresses represented by B both
      contain at least one common address.  (This is only possible if
      one range is a sub-range of the other.)

   a := b
      An assignment operator, whereby the left side (a) is assigned the
      value of the right side (b). a and b may be values, network
      addresses, or unordered lists (they must be of the same type).

   c = d
      A comparison operator, returning true if the value of the left
      side (c) is equal to the value of the right side (d). c and d may
      be values, network addresses, or unordered lists (they must be of
      the same type).  If c and d are unordered lists, then they are
      considered to be equal if c contains d and d contains c (i.e.,
      they contain the same set of elements, regardless of the order in
      which they are recorded in the lists).  If c and d are network
      addresses, they are considered equal only if both addresses and
      prefix lengths are equal (i.e., they represent the same).

   e != f
      A comparison operator, returning not (e = f), i.e., returning true
      where (e = f) would have returned false, and returning false where
      (e = f) would have returned true.

   This protocol:

   o  Is applicable to networks, especially wireless networks, in which
      unknown neighbors can be reached by local broadcast or multicast
      packets.

   o  Is designed to work in networks with a dynamic topology, and in
      which messages may be lost, such as due to collisions in wireless
      networks.

   o  Supports routers that each have one or more participating MANET
      interfaces.  The set of a router's interfaces may change over
      time.  Each interface may have one or more associated network
      addresses, and these may also be dynamically changing.

   o  Provides each router with current local topology information up to
      two hops away, and makes this local topology information available
      to MANET routing protocols in Information Bases.

   o  Uses the packet and message formats specified in [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>].  This
      includes the definition of a HELLO Message Type, used for
      signaling local topology information.

   o  Allows "external" and "internal" extensibility as enabled by
      [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>].

   o  May interact with, and be extended by, other protocols, such as
      MANET routing protocols, see <a href="#section-16">Section 16</a>.

   o  Can use relevant link-layer information if it is available.

   The objective of this protocol is, for each router:

   o  To identify 1-hop neighbors and symmetric 1-hop neighbors of this
      router.

   o  To find the interface network addresses of the router's symmetric
      2-hop neighbors.

   o  To record this information in Information Bases and thus make this
      information available to other protocols that use this
      neighborhood discovery protocol.

   o  To be available for use by other protocols, which MAY extend the
      information in these Information Bases, including adding new Sets
      to Information Bases, new elements to protocol Tuples and new TLVs
      to be included in outgoing HELLO messages and processed when in
      incoming HELLO messages.

   These objectives are achieved using local (1-hop) signaling that:

   o  Advertises the presence of a router and its interface network
      addresses.

   o  Discovers links from neighboring routers.

   o  Performs bi-directionality checks on the discovered links.

   o  Advertises discovered links, and whether each is symmetric, to its
      1-hop neighbors, and hence discovers symmetric 2-hop neighbors.

   This specification defines, in turn:

   o  Parameters and constants used by the protocol.  Parameters used by
      this protocol may, where appropriate, be specific to a given MANET
      interface or to a MANET router.  This protocol allows all
      parameters to be changed dynamically, and to be set independently
      for each MANET router or MANET interface, as appropriate.

   In order for a router to participate in a MANET, it MUST have at
   least one, and possibly more, MANET interfaces.

   Each MANET interface:

   o  Is configured with one or more network addresses.  Each address in
      the range of addresses represented by that network address MUST
      satisfy the following properties:

      o  It MUST be unique to this router, i.e., it MUST NOT be assigned
         to any interface of any other router.

      o  If assigned to other MANET interfaces, on the same router,
         these MANET interfaces MUST be isolated, i.e., addresses may
         only be assigned to different interfaces on the same router if
         no MANET interface on another router can communicate with both.
         For example, interfaces using distinct radio "channels" MAY be
         assigned the same address.

   o  Has a set of interface parameters, defining the behavior of this
      MANET interface.  Each MANET interface MAY be individually
      parameterized.

   o  Has an Interface Information Base, recording information regarding
      links to this MANET interface and symmetric 2-hop neighbors that
      can be reached through such links.

   o  Generates and processes HELLO messages.

   In addition to a set of MANET interfaces as described above, each
   router has:

   o  A Local Information Base, containing the network addresses of the
      interfaces (MANET and non-MANET) of this router.  The contents of
      this Information Base are not changed by signaling.

   o  A Neighbor Information Base, recording information regarding
      current and recently lost 1-hop neighbors of this router.

   A router may have both MANET interfaces and non-MANET interfaces.
   Interfaces of both of these types are recorded in a router's Local
   Information Base, which is used, but not updated, by the signaling of
   this protocol.

   Each router maintains protocol state using Information Bases,
   described in the following sections.  Each Information Base consists
   of a number of Protocol Sets.  Each Protocol Set contains a number of
   Protocol Tuples.

   An implementation of this protocol MAY maintain this information in
   the indicated form, or in any other organization that offers access
   to this information.  In particular, note that it is not necessary to
   remove Protocol Tuples from Protocol Sets at the exact time
   indicated, only to behave as if the Protocol Tuples were removed at
   that time.

   Information in the Local Information Base is defined locally and
   included in HELLO messages.  Information in the Interface Information
   Base and the Neighbor Information Base is determined from received
   HELLO messages; some of this information may also be included in
   transmitted HELLO messages.  Such information has a limited duration
   in which it is considered valid.  This duration is determined from
   the VALIDITY_TIME TLV in the HELLO message in which the information
   is received, which in turn is set by the router that originated the
   HELLO message, using its corresponding interface parameter
   H_HOLD_TIME.

   <a href="#appendix-E">Appendix E</a> illustrates the relationship between message reception,
   included VALIDITY_TIME TLVs, and the duration for which information
   received in a HELLO message is considered valid.  <a href="#appendix-F">Appendix F</a>
   illustrates some example topologies and how they correspond to
   information in the Information Bases.

   Each router maintains a Local Information Base, which contains the
   router's local configuration information, specifically:

   o  The Local Interface Set, which consists of Local Interface Tuples,
      each of which represents an interface (MANET or non-MANET) of the
      router.

   o  The Removed Interface Address Set, which consists of Removed
      Interface Address Tuples, each of which records a recently used
      network address of an interface (MANET or non-MANET) of the
      router.

   The Local Interface Set is used for generating HELLO messages,
   specifically for determining which interface network addresses are to
   be included and identified as local interfaces.  The Removed
   Interface Address Set is used to avoid incorrectly recording a
   formerly used network address as a symmetric 2-hop neighbor's network
   address.

   The Local Information Base is used for generating signaling, but is
   not itself updated by signaling specified in this document.  Updates
   to the Local Information Base are due to changes of the router
   configuration, and may be allowed to trigger signaling.

   Each router maintains, for each of its MANET interfaces, an Interface
   Information Base, which contains 1-hop neighborhood and symmetric
   2-hop neighborhood information collected from this MANET interface,
   specifically:

   o  A Link Set, which records information about current and recently
      lost links between this MANET interface and MANET interfaces of
      1-hop neighbors.  The Link Set consists of Link Tuples, each of
      which contains information about a single link.  Link quality
      information (see <a href="#section-14">Section 14</a>), when used, is recorded in Link
      Tuples.

   o  A 2-Hop Set, which records the existence of symmetric links
      between symmetric 1-hop neighbors of this MANET interface and
      other routers (symmetric 2-hop neighbors).  The 2-Hop Set consists
      of 2-Hop Tuples, each of which records a network address of a
      symmetric 2-hop neighbor, and all network addresses of the
      corresponding symmetric 1-hop neighbor.

   The Link Set for a MANET interface is used for generating HELLO
   messages.  Specifically, the Link Set information is included to both
   allow other routers to identify symmetric links and to populate the
   2-Hop Set.  Recently lost links are recorded in the Link Set for a
   MANET interface so that they can be advertised in HELLO messages,
   accelerating their removal from relevant 1-hop neighbors' Link Sets.

   The Link Set for a MANET interface is itself updated on receiving a
   HELLO message, including recording symmetric links as indicated
   above.  The 2-Hop Set for a MANET interface is updated as indicated
   above, and is not itself used in generating HELLO messages.

   Each router maintains a Neighbor Information Base, which contains
   collected information about current and recently lost 1-hop
   neighbors, specifically:

   o  The Neighbor Set consists of Neighbor Tuples, each of which
      records all network addresses of a single 1-hop neighbor.
      Neighbor Tuples are maintained as long as there are corresponding
      Link Tuples.

   o  The Lost Neighbor Set consists of Lost Neighbor Tuples, each of
      which records a network address of a recently lost symmetric 1-hop
      neighbor.

   The Neighbor Set associates all network addresses of each 1-hop
   neighbor.  These network addresses may be included when generating a
   HELLO message, so that other symmetric 1-hop neighbors can record
   this information in a 2-Hop Set.  The Neighbor Set can be updated on
   receiving a HELLO message.

   The Lost Neighbor Set is used to determine which network addresses
   are to be included in a HELLO message as being lost (of a recently
   symmetric 1-hop neighbor).  The Lost Neighbor Set can itself be
   updated on receiving a HELLO message.

   Signaling consists of a single type of message, known as a HELLO
   message.  Each router generates HELLO messages on each of its MANET
   interfaces.  HELLO messages are generated independently on each MANET
   interface of a MANET router; the content of a given HELLO message
   depends on the MANET interface for which it has been generated.

   Each HELLO message:

   o  Identifies, as far as is required, the MANET interface for which
      it is generated and transmitted; this allows recipients of that
      HELLO message to identify that MANET interface from among those it
      may hear.

   o  Reports the network addresses of other interfaces (MANET and non-
      MANET) of the router; this allows recipients of that HELLO message
      to associate a set of network addresses with a single 1-hop
      neighbor.

   o  Includes 1-hop neighbor information from the Information Bases;
      this allows detection of local symmetric links, and symmetric
      2-hop neighbors.

   HELLO message generation, and the validity of the information
   recorded as a consequence of processing a HELLO message, is affected
   by timers and validity information included in HELLO messages through
   TLVs.  The relationship between message timers and intervals is
   illustrated in <a href="#appendix-E">Appendix E</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.1.%20%20HELLO%20Message%20Generation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.1" name="section-4.3.1">4.3.1</a>.  HELLO Message Generation</span>

   HELLO messages are generated by a router for each of its MANET
   interfaces, and MAY be sent:

   o  Proactively, at a regular interval, known as HELLO_INTERVAL.
      HELLO_INTERVAL may be fixed, or may be dynamic.  For example,
      HELLO_INTERVAL may be backed off due to congestion or network
      stability.

   o  As a response to a change in the router itself, or its 1-hop
      neighborhood, for example, on first becoming active or in response
      to a new, lost, or changed status link.

   o  In a combination of these proactive and responsive mechanisms.

   Jittering of HELLO message generation and transmission SHOULD be used
   as described in <a href="#section-11.2">Section 11.2</a>, unless the medium access control
   mechanism in use prevents any simultaneous transmissions by
   potentially interfering routers.

   HELLO messages MAY be scheduled independently for each MANET
   interface, or, interface parameters permitting, using the same
   schedule for all MANET interfaces of a router.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.2.%20%20HELLO%20Message%20Content"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3.2" name="section-4.3.2">4.3.2</a>.  HELLO Message Content</span>

   The content of a HELLO message MUST satisfy the following:

   o  A HELLO message MUST contain all of the network addresses in the
      Local Interface Set of the router on which the HELLO message is
      being generated.  This includes:

      o  At least one network address of each MANET interface of the
         router.

      o  Network addresses that include all source addresses of any IP
         datagrams sent by the router on any MANET interface.

      o  All other network addresses of the router that are to be made
         known to any other router for any reason.

   o  For each MANET interface, within every time interval equal to the
      corresponding REFRESH_INTERVAL, sent HELLO messages MUST
      collectively include all of the relevant information in the
      corresponding Link Set and the Neighbor Information Base.  Note
      that when determining whether to include information in a HELLO
      message, the sender MUST consider all times up to the latest time
      when it may send its next HELLO message on this MANET interface.

   o  For each MANET interface, within every time interval equal to the
      corresponding REFRESH_INTERVAL, sent HELLO messages MUST
      collectively include all of the relevant information in the
      corresponding Link Set and the Neighbor Information Base.

   o  When determining whether to include a given piece of neighbor
      information in a HELLO message, it is not sufficient to consider
      whether that information has been sent in the interval of length
      REFRESH_INTERVAL up to the current time.  Instead, the router MUST
      consider the interval of length REFRESH_INTERVAL that will end at
      the latest possible time at which the next HELLO message will be
      sent on this MANET interface.  (Normally, this will be
      HELLO_INTERVAL past the current time, but MAY be earlier if this
      router elects to divide its neighbor information among more than
      one HELLO message in order to reduce the size of its HELLO
      messages.)  All neighbor information MUST be sent in this
      interval, i.e., the router MUST ensure that this HELLO message
      includes all neighbor information that has not already been
      included in any HELLO messages sent since the start of this

      interval (normally, the current time - (REFRESH_INTERVAL -

   o  A HELLO message MUST include exactly one VALIDITY_TIME Message
      TLV, as specified in [<a href="rfc5497.html" title='"Representing Multi-Value Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5497</a>], that indicates the length of time
      for which the message content is to be considered valid, and is
      therefore to be included in the receiving router's Interface
      Information Base.

   o  A periodically generated HELLO message SHOULD include exactly one
      INTERVAL_TIME Message TLV, as specified in [<a href="rfc5497.html" title='"Representing Multi-Value Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5497</a>], that

   HELLO messages received by a router are used to update the Interface
   Information Base for the MANET interface over which that HELLO
   message was received, as well as the Neighbor Information Base of the
   router.  Specifically:

   o  The router ensures that there is a single Neighbor Tuple
      corresponding to the originator of that HELLO message.

   o  The router ensures that there is a Link Tuple, with appropriate
      status (heard or symmetric) and advertised duration, corresponding
      to the link between the MANET interfaces on which that HELLO
      message was sent and received.  One or more Lost Neighbor Tuples
      may be created if the HELLO message reports that the link was
      lost.

   o  If the link between the MANET interfaces on which the HELLO
      message was sent and received is symmetric, then the router
      ensures that there are the appropriate 2-Hop Tuples, with
      advertised duration.

   The processing defined in this specification handles any unexpected
   and erroneous information in a HELLO message, maintaining the
   constraints on Information Base contents specified in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

   Some links in a MANET may be marginal, e.g., due to adverse wireless
   propagation.  In order to avoid using such marginal links, a link
   quality value is recorded in each Link Tuple.  A MANET router
   considers links for which an insufficient link quality is recorded as
   lost.  Modifying the recorded link quality in a Link Tuple is

   OPTIONAL.  If link quality is not to be modified, it MUST be set to
   indicate an always usable quality link.

   Note that link quality is a "link admittance" mechanism, allowing a
   router to determine that a given link is too unstable to even
   consider for use.  It is specifically not a link metric nor is it a
   substitute for one.

   Link quality information is only used locally and is not used in
   signaling.  Routers may interoperate whether they are using the same,
   different, or no link quality information.  Link quality information
   is thus not equivalent to a link metric.

   Link quality information is defined in this specification as a
   normalized, dimensionless value in the interval zero to one,
   inclusive, where the greater the value, the better the link quality.

   set of interface parameter values.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.1.%20%20Message%20Intervals"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.1" name="section-5.3.1">5.3.1</a>.  Message Intervals</span>

   HELLO messages serve two principal functions:

   o  To advertise network addresses of this router's interface to its
      1-hop neighbors.  The frequency of these advertisements is
      regulated by the interface parameters HELLO_INTERVAL and
      HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL.

   o  To advertise this router's knowledge of each of its 1-hop
      neighbors.  The frequency of the advertisement of each such
      neighbor is regulated by the interface parameter REFRESH_INTERVAL.

   Specifically, these parameters are as follows:

   HELLO_INTERVAL:
      The maximum time between the transmission of two successive HELLO
      messages on this MANET interface.  If using periodic transmission
      of HELLO messages, these SHOULD be at a separation of
      HELLO_INTERVAL, possibly modified by jitter as specified in
      [<a href="rfc5148.html" title='"Jitter Considerations in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5148</a>].

   HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL:
      The minimum interval between transmission of two successive HELLO
      messages on this MANET interface.  (This minimum interval MAY be
      modified by jitter, as defined in [<a href="rfc5148.html" title='"Jitter Considerations in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5148</a>].)

   REFRESH_INTERVAL:
      The maximum interval between advertisements, in a HELLO message on
      this MANET interface, of each 1-hop neighbor network address and
      its status.  In all intervals of length REFRESH_INTERVAL, a router
      MUST include each 1-hop neighbor network address and its status in
      at least one HELLO message on this MANET interface.  (This may be
      in the same or in different HELLO messages.)

   REFRESH_INTERVAL thus represents the frequency at which a piece of
   information, as received in HELLO messages, can be expected to be
   refreshed.  Thus, the REFRESH_INTERVAL is used as a basis for
   determining when such information expires in receiving routers (see
   <a href="#section-5.3.2">Section 5.3.2</a>).  HELLO_INTERVAL represents the frequency of HELLO
   message emissions.  Logically, HELLO_INTERVAL cannot be greater than
   the REFRESH_INTERVAL; otherwise, information cannot be refreshed in a
   timely manner.

   HELLO messages can, however, be sent with a higher frequency.  A
   possible use for sending HELLO messages at such a higher frequency
   includes sending partial HELLO messages (e.g., accommodating
   constraints on packet sizes from the underlying medium) refreshing
   only part of the information in each HELLO message.  Another use is
   for a router to send "empty HELLO messages", advertising its own
   presence frequently in smaller HELLO messages (e.g., in case HELLO
   message exchange success rates are used for link quality estimation,
   or to enable rapid detection by new routers in the neighborhood) in
   between HELLO messages refreshing neighbor information in other
   routers.

   The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL &gt; 0

   o  HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL &gt;= 0

   o  HELLO_INTERVAL &gt;= HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL

   o  REFRESH_INTERVAL &gt;= HELLO_INTERVAL

   o  If an INTERVAL_TIME Message TLV as defined in [<a href="rfc5497.html" title='"Representing Multi-Value Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5497</a>] is
      included in a HELLO message, then HELLO_INTERVAL MUST be
      representable as described in [<a href="rfc5497.html" title='"Representing Multi-Value Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5497</a>].

   If REFRESH_INTERVAL &gt; HELLO_INTERVAL, then a router may distribute
   its neighbor advertisements between HELLO messages in any manner,
   subject to the constraints above.

   In the absence of any changes to the local neighborhood, a router
   will send a HELLO message on a MANET interface after an (possibly
   jittered) interval of length HELLO_INTERVAL.  For a router to employ
   this protocol in a purely responsive manner on a MANET interface,
   i.e., for the router to only send HELLO messages on that MANET
   interface as a response to external events, HELLO_INTERVAL (and hence
   also REFRESH_INTERVAL) SHOULD be set sufficiently large, i.e., such
   that a responsive HELLO message is always expected with a shorter
   period than this value.

   If a router has more than one MANET interface, then, even if the
   router configures different values of HELLO_INTERVAL on each MANET
   interface, the router SHOULD configure the same value of
   HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL on all MANET interfaces on which responsive HELLO
   messages may be sent.  (This ensures that changes observed on one
   MANET interface are reported on other MANET interfaces, so that 1-hop
   neighbors connected to the latter can maintain up-to-date 2-hop
   neighborhood information.)

   The following interface parameters manage the validity time of link
   information:

   L_HOLD_TIME:
      The period of advertisement, on this MANET interface, of former
      1-hop neighbor network addresses as lost in HELLO messages,
      allowing recipients of these HELLO messages to accelerate removal
      of this information from their Link Sets.  L_HOLD_TIME MAY be set
      to zero, if accelerated information removal is not required.

   H_HOLD_TIME:
      Used as the Value in the VALIDITY_TIME Message TLV included in all
      HELLO messages on this MANET interface.  It is then used by each
      router receiving such a HELLO message to indicate the validity of
      the information taken from that HELLO message and recorded in the
      receiving router's Information Bases.

   Note that as each item of neighbor information is included in HELLO
   messages within an interval of length REFRESH_INTERVAL, constraints
   on H_HOLD_TIME are based on REFRESH_INTERVAL, not on HELLO_INTERVAL.

   The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:

   o  L_HOLD_TIME &gt;= 0

   o  H_HOLD_TIME &gt;= REFRESH_INTERVAL

   o  If HELLO messages can be lost, then both parameters SHOULD be
      significantly greater than REFRESH_INTERVAL.

   o  H_HOLD_TIME MUST be representable as described in [<a href="rfc5497.html" title='"Representing Multi-Value Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5497</a>].

   The following interface parameters manage the usage of link quality
   (see <a href="#section-14">Section 14</a>):

   HYST_ACCEPT:
      The link quality threshold at or above which a link becomes
      usable, if it was not already so.

   HYST_REJECT:
      The link quality threshold below which a link becomes unusable, if
      it was not already so.

   INITIAL_QUALITY:
      The initial quality of a newly identified link.

   INITIAL_PENDING:
      If true, then a newly identified link is considered pending, and
      is not usable until the link quality has reached or exceeded the
      HYST_ACCEPT threshold.

   The following constraints apply to these interface parameters:

   o  0 &lt;= HYST_REJECT &lt;= HYST_ACCEPT &lt;= 1

   o  0 &lt;= INITIAL_QUALITY &lt;= 1.

   o  If link quality is not updated, then INITIAL_QUALITY &gt;=

   If jitter, as defined in [<a href="rfc5148.html" title='"Jitter Considerations in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5148</a>], is used, then these parameters
   are as follows:

   HP_MAXJITTER:

   The following router parameter manages the validity time of lost
   symmetric 1-hop neighbor information:

   N_HOLD_TIME:
      Used as the period during which former 1-hop neighbor network
      addresses are advertised as lost in HELLO messages, allowing
      recipients of these HELLO messages to accelerate removal of this
      information from their 2-Hop Sets.  N_HOLD_TIME MAY be set to
      zero, if accelerated information removal is not required.

   I_HOLD_TIME:
      The period for which a recently used local interface network

   If protocol parameters are changed dynamically, the constraints in
   this section apply.

   HELLO_INTERVAL

      o  If the HELLO_INTERVAL for a MANET interface increases, then the
         next HELLO message on this MANET interface MUST be generated
         according to the previous, shorter, HELLO_INTERVAL.  A number
         of subsequent HELLO messages MAY be generated according to the
         previous, shorter, HELLO_INTERVAL (but MUST include times
         according to current parameters).  This ensures that "promises"
         as to timely transmission of a future HELLO message are kept
         until these previous promises have expired.

      o  If the HELLO_INTERVAL for a MANET interface decreases, then the
         following HELLO messages on this MANET interface MUST be
         generated according to this current, shorter, HELLO_INTERVAL.

   REFRESH_INTERVAL

      o  If the REFRESH_INTERVAL for a MANET interface increases, then
         the content of subsequent HELLO messages must be organized such
         that the specification of the old value of REFRESH_INTERVAL is
         satisfied for a further period equal to the old value of
         REFRESH_INTERVAL.

      o  If the REFRESH_INTERVAL for a MANET interface decreases, then
         it MAY be necessary to reschedule HELLO message generation on
         that MANET interface, in order for the specification of
         REFRESH_INTERVAL is satisfied from the time of change.

   HYST_ACCEPT and HYST_REJECT

      o  If HYST_ACCEPT or HYST_REJECT changes, then the appropriate
         actions for link quality change, as specified in <a href="#section-14.3">Section 14.3</a>,
         MUST be taken.

   L_HOLD_TIME

      o  If L_HOLD_TIME changes, then the expiry times of all relevant
         Link Tuples MUST be changed.

   N_HOLD_TIME

      o  If N_HOLD_TIME changes, then the expiry times of all relevant
         Lost Neighbor Tuples MUST be changed.

         schedule on this MANET interface MAY be changed.

   HT_MAXJITTER

      o  If HT_MAXJITTER changes, then externally triggered HELLO
         messages on this MANET interface MAY be rescheduled.

   A router maintains a Local Information Base that records information
   about its interfaces (MANET and non-MANET).  Each interface of a
   router MUST be identified by at least one network address.  Such



<span class="grey">Clausen, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 24]</span></pre>

   network addresses MAY be specific to that interface, or MAY in some
   circumstances be used by more than one interface as specified below.

   The Local Information Base is not modified by signaling.  If a
   router's interface configuration changes, then the Local Information
   Base MUST reflect these changes.  This MAY also result in signaling
   to advertise these changes.

   It is not necessary to include all addresses of an interface in the
   Local Information Base, and hence in HELLO messages.  However, any
   address that may be the source address of an IP datagram sent from
   that interface MUST be included (and at least one address MUST be
   included).  A protocol using this specification MAY add additional
   requirements to these, e.g., that any address that may be the
   destination address of an IP datagram is also included.

   The addresses assigned to an interface are "owned" by the router, and
   MUST NOT be used by any other router as an interface address.  If an
   address has a prefix length and represents a range of addresses, this
   applies to all addresses in that range (i.e., such ranges MUST NOT
   overlap).

   The addresses assigned to different interfaces on the same router
   MUST be distinct (hence, network address ranges MUST NOT overlap)
   except that:

   o  The same address MAY be assigned to any number of non-MANET
      interfaces as well as to one (or more if the following condition
      also applies) MANET interface.

   o  The same address MAY be assigned to two (or more if each pair
      satisfies this condition) MANET interfaces if those two MANET
      interfaces cannot communicate to, from, or one to and one from any
      other MANET interface of another router.

      addresses of this interface.

      I_manet is a boolean flag, describing if this interface is a MANET
      interface.

   Local Interface Tuples are removed from the Local Interface Set only
   when the routers' interface configuration changes, subject to

   A router's Removed Interface Address Set records network addresses
   that were recently used as local interface network addresses.  If a
   router's interface network addresses are immutable, then the Removed
   Interface Address Set is always empty and MAY be omitted.  It
   consists of Removed Interface Address Tuples, one per network
   address:

      (IR_local_iface_addr, IR_time)

   where:

      IR_local_iface_addr is a recently used network address of an
      interface of this router.

      IR_time specifies when this Tuple expires and MUST be removed.

   A router maintains an Interface Information Base for each of its
   MANET interfaces.  This records information about links to that MANET
   interface and symmetric 2-hop neighbors that can be reached in two
   hops using those links as the first hop.  Each Interface Information
   Base includes a Link Set and a 2-Hop Set.

   A network address of a symmetric 2-hop neighbor can also be present
   as the network address of a 1-hop neighbor.  This allows the router
   using this network address to be immediately considered as a
   symmetric 2-hop neighbor if it fails to be a symmetric 1-hop
   neighbor.

   An element that specifies a time is considered expired if the current
   time is greater than or equal to that time.  One such element,
   present in most Tuples, indicates, when expired, that the Tuple
   itself is considered expired and MUST be removed.  Tuples that do not
   have such a time element are removed at other times as specified; for
   example, a Neighbor Tuple is removed when all corresponding Link
   Tuples have been removed.

   An interface's Link Set records links from other routers that are, or
   recently were, 1-hop neighbors.  It consists of Link Tuples, each
   representing a single link:

      (L_neighbor_iface_addr_list, L_HEARD_time, L_SYM_time,
       L_quality, L_pending, L_lost, L_time)

   where:

      L_neighbor_iface_addr_list is an unordered list of the network
      addresses of the MANET interface of the 1-hop neighbor;

      L_HEARD_time is the time up to which the MANET interface of the
      1-hop neighbor would be considered heard if not considering link
      quality;

      L_SYM_time is the time up to which the link to the 1-hop neighbor
      would be considered symmetric if not considering link quality;

      L_quality is a dimensionless number between 0 (inclusive) and 1
      (inclusive) describing the quality of a link; a greater value of
      L_quality indicating a higher quality link;

      L_pending is a boolean flag, describing if a link is considered
      pending (i.e., a candidate, but not yet established, link);

      L_lost is a boolean flag, describing if a link is considered lost
      due to low link quality;

      L_time specifies when this Tuple expires and MUST be removed.

   The status of the link, as obtained through HELLO message exchange
   and using link quality, is denoted L_status.  L_status can take the
   Values PENDING, HEARD, SYMMETRIC, and LOST.  The values LOST,
   SYMMETRIC, and HEARD are defined in <a href="#section-18.5">Section 18.5</a>.  The Value PENDING
   is never used in a HELLO message, it is only used locally by a
   router, and any Value distinct from LOST, SYMMETRIC, and HEARD may be
   used.

   L_status is defined by:

   1.  If L_pending = true, then L_status := PENDING;

   2.  otherwise, if L_lost = true, then L_status := LOST;

   An interface's 2-Hop Set records network addresses of symmetric 2-hop
   neighbors, and the symmetric links to symmetric 1-hop neighbors
   through which these symmetric 2-hop neighbors can be reached.  It
   consists of 2-Hop Tuples, each representing a single network address

   where:

      N2_neighbor_iface_addr_list is an unordered list of the network
      addresses of the MANET interface of the symmetric 1-hop neighbor
      from which this information was received;

      N2_2hop_addr is a network address of a symmetric 2-hop neighbor
      that has a symmetric link (using any MANET interface) to the
      indicated symmetric 1-hop neighbor;

      N2_time specifies when this Tuple expires and MUST be removed.

   A router's Lost Neighbor Set records network addresses of routers
   that recently were symmetric 1-hop neighbors but that are now
   advertised as lost.  It consists of Lost Neighbor Tuples, each
   representing a single such network address:

      (NL_neighbor_addr, NL_time)

   The Local Information Base MUST be updated in response to changes in

   the Interface Information Base and the Neighbor Information Base.  If
   any changes to the latter Information Bases satisfy any of the

   If an interface is removed from the router, then this MUST result in
   changes to the Local Information Base and to the Neighbor Information
   Base as follows:

   1.  Identify the Local Interface Tuple that corresponds to the
       interface to be removed.

   2.  For each network address (henceforth removed address) in the
       I_local_iface_addr_list of that Local Interface Tuple, if that
       network address is not in the I_local_iface_addr_list of any
       other Local Interface Tuple, then create a Removed Interface
       Address Tuple with:

       o  IR_local_iface_addr := removed address;

       o  IR_time := current time + I_HOLD_TIME.

   3.  Remove that Local Interface Tuple from the Local Interface Set.

   4.  If the interface to be removed is a MANET interface (i.e., with
       I_manet = true), then:

       1.  Remove the Interface Information Base for that MANET
           interface;

       2.  All Neighbor Tuples for which none of the network addresses
           in its N_neighbor_addr_list are contained in any
           L_neighbor_iface_addr_list in any remaining Link Tuple are
           removed.

   If the removed interface is the last MANET interface of the router,
   then there will be no remaining Interface Information Bases, and the
   router will no longer participate in this protocol.

   After removing the interface and making these changes, a HELLO
   message MAY be sent on all remaining MANET interfaces.

   1.  Remove any Removed Interface Address Tuple whose
       IR_local_iface_addr is the added network address.

   2.  Remove any Neighbor Tuples whose N_neighbor_addr_list contains a

   5.  Remove any 2-Hop Tuples whose N2_2hop_addr overlaps the added
       network address.

   After adding the network address and making these changes, a HELLO
   message MAY be sent on all MANET interfaces.

   These changes, other than to the appropriate I_local_iface_addr_list,
   are made in order to maintain consistency of the Information Bases.

   o  This protocol specifies one Message Type, the HELLO message.

   o  A HELLO message MAY use any combination of Message Header options
      specified in [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>].

   o  HELLO messages MUST NOT be forwarded, i.e., a &lt;msg-hop-limit&gt;, if
      present, MUST have the value 1.

   o  HELLO messages MAY be included in multi-message packets as
      specified in [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>].

   o  Received HELLO messages MUST be parsed in accordance with

      reasons, see <a href="#section-12.1">Section 12.1</a>.

   o  This protocol specifies three Address Block TLVs.  It also uses
      two Message TLVs defined in [<a href="rfc5497.html" title='"Representing Multi-Value Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5497</a>].  These five TLV Types are

   If any such network addresses have been added to these Information
   Bases since the last HELLO message was sent on this MANET interface,
   or if their status (as indicated by these TLVs and the Values they
   associate with that network address) have changed since that network
   address was last reported on this MANET interface, then that network
   address, and the indicated TLVs, SHOULD be included in the HELLO
   message.

   If the address object (see [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>]) representing a network address
   of a 1-hop neighbor is specified with more than one associated
   Address Block TLV, then these Address Block TLVs MAY be independently
   included or excluded from each HELLO message.  Each such Address
   Block TLV MUST be included associated with the address object
   representation of that network address in a HELLO message sent on
   that MANET interface in every interval of length equal to that MANET
   interface's parameter REFRESH_INTERVAL.  Address Block TLVs
   associated with the same address object included in the same HELLO

   Each form of jitter described in [<a href="rfc5148.html" title='"Jitter Considerations in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5148</a>] requires a parameter

   When HELLO message generation is delayed in order that a HELLO

   <a href="#section-12.1">Section 12.1</a> and, if so, discard the message without further

   the indicated consequences in that section MUST be applied
   immediately, unless noted otherwise.

   All message processing, including determination of whether a message

   unverifiable HELLO messages by this protocol.

   An invalid message MUST be silently discarded, without updating the

   o  "validity time" is calculated from the Message TLV with Type =
      VALIDITY_TIME of the HELLO message as specified in [<a href="rfc5497.html" title='"Representing Multi-Value Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5497</a>].
      (Note that, as specified by <a href="#section-12.1">Section 12.1</a>, there must be exactly
      one such Message TLV in the HELLO message.)  All information in
      the HELLO message used by this specification has the same validity
      time.

   o  "Receiving Address List" is the I_local_iface_addr_list
      corresponding to the MANET interface on which the HELLO message
      was received

   o  "Sending Address List" is an unordered list of network addresses
      of the MANET interface over which the HELLO message was sent,
      i.e., is an unordered list of the network addresses represented by
      address objects contained in the HELLO message with an associated
      Address Block TLV with Type = LOCAL_IF and Value = THIS_IF.  If

      to the sending address of the IP datagram in which the HELLO
      message was included.

      addresses of all the interfaces of the router that generated the
      HELLO message, i.e., is the Sending Address List, plus the network

   2.  Remove all Link Tuples whose L_neighbor_iface_addr_list is now

          addresses in the Sending Address List.

   2.  If there is more than one matching Link Tuple, then remove them
       all; apply <a href="#section-13.2">Section 13.2</a> but not <a href="#section-13.3">Section 13.3</a>.

   3.  If no matching Link Tuples remain, then create a new matching
       Link Tuple with:

   Link quality is a mechanism whereby a router MAY take considerations
   other than message exchange into account for determining when a link
   is and is not a candidate for being considered as HEARD or SYMMETRIC.
   As such, it is a "link admission" mechanism.

   Link quality information for a link is generated (e.g., through
   access to signal to noise ratio, packet loss rate, or other
   information from the link layer) and used only locally, i.e., is not
   included in signaling, and routers may interoperate whether they are
   using the same, different, or no, link quality information.  Link
   quality information is specified as a normalized, dimensionless
   figure in the interval zero to one, inclusive, a higher value
   indicating a better link quality.

   For deployments where no link quality is used, the considerations in
   <a href="#section-14.1">Section 14.1</a> apply.  For deployments where link quality is used, the
   general principles of link quality usage are described in
   <a href="#section-14.2">Section 14.2</a>.  Sections <a href="#section-14.3">14.3</a> and <a href="#section-14.4">14.4</a> detail link quality
   functioning.

   In order for a router to not employ link quality, the router MUST
   define:

   o  INITIAL_PENDING := false;

   o  INITIAL_QUALITY &gt;= HYST_REJECT (there is no reason not to define
      INITIAL_QUALITY := 1).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/14.2.%20%20Basic%20Principles%20of%20Link%20Quality"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-14.2" name="section-14.2">14.2</a>.  Basic Principles of Link Quality</span>

   To enable link quality usage, the L_quality value of a Link Tuple is
   used in conjunction with two thresholds, HYST_ACCEPT and HYST_REJECT,
   to set the flags L_pending and L_lost of that Link Tuple.  Based on
   these flags, the link status to advertise for that Link Tuple is
   determined as described in <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>.

   The use of two thresholds implements link hysteresis, whereby a link
   that has HYST_REJECT &lt;= L_quality &lt; HYST_ACCEPT may be either
   accepted or rejected (depending on which threshold it has most
   recently crossed, or, if neither, on the value of parameter
   INITIAL_PENDING).  With appropriate values of these parameters, this
   prevents overly rapid changes of link status.

   The basic principles of link quality usage are as follows:

   o  A router does not advertise a neighbor interface in any state
      until L_quality is acceptable:

      o  If INITIAL_PENDING = true, then the link is advertised when
         link L_quality &gt;= HYST_ACCEPT.

      o  Otherwise, the link is advertised when L_quality &gt;=
         HYST_REJECT.

      A link that is not yet advertised has L_pending = true.

   o  Once L_quality &gt;= HYST_ACCEPT, the router sets L_pending := false,
      indicating that the link can be advertised.

   o  A link for which L_pending = false is advertised until its
      L_quality drops below HYST_REJECT.

   o  If a link has L_pending = false and L_quality &lt; HYST_REJECT, the
      link is LOST and is advertised as such.  This link is not
      reconsidered as a candidate HEARD or SYMMETRIC link until
      L_quality &gt;= HYST_ACCEPT.

   o  A link that has an acceptable quality may be advertised as HEARD,
      SYMMETRIC or LOST according to the exchange of HELLO messages.

   In order that these principles can all hold, a router MUST NOT
   define:

   o  INITIAL_PENDING = false and INITIAL_QUALITY &lt; HYST_REJECT; OR

   o  INITIAL_PENDING = true and INITIAL_QUALITY &gt;= HYST_ACCEPT.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/14.3.%20%20When%20Link%20Quality%20Changes"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-14.3" name="section-14.3">14.3</a>.  When Link Quality Changes</span>

   If L_quality for a link changes, then the following actions MUST be
   taken:

   1.  If L_quality &gt;= HYST_ACCEPT, then the corresponding Link Tuple is
       modified by:

       1.  L_pending := false;

       2.  L_lost := false;

       3.  If L_status = HEARD or L_status = SYMMETRIC, then:

           o  L_time := max(L_time, L_HEARD_time + L_HOLD_TIME).

   2.  If L_status != PENDING, and L_quality &lt; HYST_REJECT, then the
       corresponding Link Tuple is modified by:

       1.  If L_lost = false, then:

           o  L_lost := true;

           o  L_time := min(L_time, current time + L_HOLD_TIME).

   As a result of this processing, the L_STATUS of a Link Tuple may
   change.  In this case, the processing actions corresponding to this
   change, as specified in <a href="#section-13">Section 13</a>, MUST also be taken.

   If L_quality for a link is updated based on HELLO message reception,
   or on reception of a packet including a HELLO message, then L_quality
   MUST be updated prior to the HELLO message processing described in
   <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>.  (If the receipt of the HELLO message, or the packet
   containing it, creates the Link Tuple, then the Link Tuple MUST be
   created with the appropriately updated L_quality value, rather than
   with L_quality := INITIAL_QUALITY.)

   A router MAY update link quality based on any information available
   to it.  Particular cases that MAY be used include:

   o  Information from the link layer, such as signal-to-noise ratio or
      packet acknowledgment reception and loss information.

   o  Receipt or loss of control packets.  If control packets include a
      sequential packet sequence number, as defined in [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>], then
      link quality can be updated when a control packet is received,
      whether or not it contains a HELLO message.  The link quality may
      then, for example, be based on whether the last N out of M control
      packets on the link were received, or may use a "leaky integrator"
      tracking packet reception and loss.

   o  Receipt or loss of HELLO messages.  If the maximum interval
      between HELLO messages is known (such as by inclusion in HELLO
      messages of a Message TLV with Type := INTERVAL_TIME, as defined
      in [<a href="rfc5497.html" title='"Representing Multi-Value Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5497</a>]), then the loss of HELLO messages can be determined
      without the need to receive a later HELLO message.  Note that if
      this case is combined with the previous case, then care must be
      taken to avoid "double counting" a lost HELLO message in a lost
      packet.

      allow inserting relay selection information into a HELLO message
      by way of adding a TLV to an outgoing HELLO message prior to it
      being transmitted.

   o  Through accessing an incoming HELLO message, and potentially
      discarding it prior to processing by this protocol.  This may, for
      example, allow a security protocol as suggested in <a href="#section-17">Section 17</a> to
      perform verification of HELLO message signatures and prevent
      processing of unverifiable HELLO messages by this protocol.

   o  Through accessing an incoming HELLO message after it has been
      completely processed by this protocol.  This may, in particular,
      allow a protocol that has added information, such as relay
      selection information by way of inclusion of appropriate TLVs,
      access to such information after appropriate updates have been
      recorded in the Information Bases in this protocol.

   o  Through requesting that a HELLO message be generated at a specific
      time.  In that case, HELLO message generation MUST still respect
      the constraints in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

   Address objects in HELLO messages are processed according to their
   associated Address Block TLVs.  All such address objects are to be
   processed according to this specification are associated with Address
   Block TLVs with Type of LOCAL_IF, OTHER_NEIGHB, or LINK_STATUS (and
   type extension zero).  Address objects not associated with an Address
   Block TLV of any of these Types are therefore not processed by the
   protocol described in this specification.

   A protocol, such as a MANET routing protocol, interacting with this
   protocol may need to add information to HELLO messages.  This may be
   in the form of associating TLVs (of Type other than LOCAL_IF,
   OTHER_NEIGHB, or LINK_STATUS) to address objects already included by
   this specification.

   A protocol, such as a MANET routing protocol, interacting with this
   protocol may also add information to HELLO messages by inserting
   address objects not already included by this specification.  Such
   address objects are in the following called "inserted addresses".
   These inserted addresses may added to Address Blocks already present
   by virtue of the HELLO message generation in this specification, or
   may appear in new Address Blocks.  In both cases, the following MUST
   be observed:

   o  An inserted address MUST NOT be associated with an Address Block
      TLV of Type LOCAL_IF, OTHER_NEIGHB, or LINK_STATUS.  Consequently,
      the processing in this specification will ignore such address
      objects.

   o  Each inserted address MUST be associated with an Address Block
      TLV, to be defined by the specification of the protocol inserting
      the address object.  In this way, all addresses present in a HELLO
      message are associated with an Address Block TLV defining their
      semantics.

   Informally speaking, Address Block TLVs define the semantics of
   address objects in an Address Block.  If an address object in an
   Address Block does not have any Address Block TLVs associated, that
   address object has no semantics.  Consequently, all protocols using
   the protocol defined in this specification MUST respect the
   following:

   o  An address object in an Address Block, which is not associated
      with any Address Block TLV, MUST be silently ignored; the mere
      presence of an address object without an associated Address Block
      TLV in a HELLO message MUST NOT cause any processing.

   A protocol interacting with this protocol MAY also add an originator
   address to HELLO messages, as specified in [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>].  Such an
   originator address MUST be unique to the originating router, it MAY
   be a local interface address of the router.  It SHOULD be used
   consistently, but SHOULD NOT be constrained in any other way.

   Strict adherence to these points will enable unambiguous coexistence
   of future "extensions" to HELLO messages.

   In some cases, a protocol interacting with the protocol defined in
   this specification, may need to recognize which HELLO messages to
   process and which HELLO messages to discard.  It is the
   responsibility of that protocol to ensure that such messages are
   suitably identifiable, e.g., through inclusion of a Message TLV or
   through recognizing an administrative configuration (such as address
   ranges).  Note that such a protocol interacting with this protocol
   MAY specify such interaction by recognizing an additional reason for
   discarding a message.  As suggested in <a href="#section-17">Section 17</a> this might, for
   example, be a security protocol discarding a message that does not
   carry a Message TLV containing a cryptographic signature.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/17.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-17" name="section-17">17</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The objective of this protocol is to allow each router in the network
   to acquire information describing its 1-hop neighborhood and
   symmetric 2-hop neighborhood.  This is acquired through HELLO message
   exchange between neighboring routers.  This information is made
   available through the Interface Information Bases and Neighbor
   Information Base, describing the router's 1-hop neighborhood and
   symmetric 2-hop neighborhood.



<span class="grey">Clausen, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 54]</span></pre>

   Under normal circumstances, the information recorded in these
   Information Bases is correct, i.e., corresponds to the actual network
   topology, apart from any changes that have not (yet) been tracked by
   the HELLO message exchanges.

   If a router for some reason, whether malice or malfunction, transmits
   invalid HELLO messages, incorrect information may be recorded in
   other routers' Information Bases.  This protocol specification does,
   however, prevent inconsistent information from being included in the
   Information Bases through the specified processing, which maintains
   the constraints in <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  The exact consequence of information
   inexactness depends on the use of these Information Bases, and SHOULD
   therefore be reflected in the specification of protocols that use
   information provided by this neighborhood discovery protocol.

   This section, therefore, firstly outlines the ways in which correctly
   formed, but still invalid, HELLO messages may appear, in
   <a href="#section-17.1">Section 17.1</a>.

   Injection of invalid HELLO messages into a network may be prevented
   in a number of ways.  If, for example, a network is deployed in a
   site to which access is strictly regulated, so that physical access
   and proximity to the network is prevented, then further security
   mechanisms to protect against malicious routers injecting invalid
   HELLO messages may not be required.  Similarly, if the link layer
   over which the network is formed provides appropriate
   confidentiality, authentication, and integrity, then this may, for a
   given deployment, suffice to appropriately protect against disclosure
   of information to an eavesdropper, and against a malicious router
   injecting invalid HELLO messages.  In the latter case, the link layer
   would discard frames that fail the link-layer checks, without
   attempting to deliver such frames to IP.  Finally, certain usage may
   be of a nature where disruption of service is of no consequence, or
   at least not of sufficient consequence to warrant deployment of
   additional security mechanisms.

   A further point to stress, and which follows from the discussions
   above is, that it will not be the case that "one size security fits
   all".  Different deployments may have different requirements.  For
   example, in a deployment of a low-value sensor network,
   authentication using a simple message authentication code and shared
   symmetric keys may suffice, while anything beyond that may require
   too many computational resources to be viable.  Conversely, in, for
   example, a community network, verifying not only that the originator
   of a HELLO message "has the right key" but also the precise identity
   of the originator may be required to be proved, and computational
   resources may be available to make such a requirement feasible.

   <a href="#section-17.2">Section 17.2</a>, therefore, does not specify a single "one-size-fits-
   all" mechanism, but rather details how the security suggestions in
   [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>] are considered for applicability within the context of this
   protocol, and with the purpose of aiding deployment-specific security
   mechanisms to be developed.

   A correctly formed, but still invalid, HELLO message may take any of
   the following forms.  Note that a present or absent address object in
   an Address Block, does not by itself cause a problem.  It is the
   presence, absence, or incorrectness of associated LOCAL_IF,
   LINK_STATUS, and OTHER_NEIGHB Address Block TLVs that causes
   problems.

   A router may provide false information about its own identity:

      o  The HELLO message may contain address objects with an
         associated LOCAL_IF Address Block TLV that do not correspond to
         addresses of interfaces of the router transmitting the HELLO
         message.

      o  The HELLO message may omit network addresses, or their
         associated LOCAL_IF Address Block TLV, of interfaces of the
         router transmitting the HELLO message (other than the allowed
         omission of the only local interface network address of the
         MANET interface over which the HELLO message is transmitted, if
         that is the case).

      o  The HELLO message may incorrectly specify the LOCAL_IF Address
         Block TLV Value associated with one or more local interface
         network addresses, indicating incorrectly whether they are
         associated with the MANET interface over which the HELLO
         message is transmitted.

   A router may provide false information about the identity of other
      routers:

      o  A present LINK_STATUS Address Block TLV may, incorrectly,
         identify a network address as being of a MANET interface that
         is or was heard on the MANET interface over which the HELLO
         message is transmitted.

      o  A consistently absent LINK_STATUS Address Block TLV may,
         incorrectly, fail to identify a network address as being of a
         MANET interface that is or was heard on the MANET interface
         over which the HELLO message is transmitted.

      o  A present OTHER_NEIGHB Address Block TLV may, incorrectly,
         identify a network address as being of a router that is or was
         in the sending router's symmetric 1-hop neighborhood.

      o  A consistently absent OTHER_NEIGHB Address Block TLV may,
         incorrectly, fail to identify a network address as being of a
         router that is or was in the sending router's symmetric 1-hop
         neighborhood.

      o  The Value of a LINK_STATUS Address Block TLV may incorrectly
         indicate the status (LOST, SYMMETRIC or HEARD) of the link from
         a 1-hop neighbor.

      o  The Value of an OTHER_NEIGHB Address Block TLV may incorrectly
         indicate the status (LOST or SYMMETRIC) of a symmetric 1-hop

   The security suggestions in [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>] regarding inclusion of a
   cryptographic signature in a Message TLV or a Packet TLV can be
   applied to this protocol.  Failure to verify either form of
   cryptographic signature should cause a HELLO message to be rejected
   without being processed.

   The following simplification of the suggestions for end-to-end
   authentication for integrity in [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>] may be applied to HELLO
   messages:

   o  As the Message Header fields &lt;msg-hop-count&gt; and &lt;msg-hop-limit&gt;
      are either omitted or will always have the values 0 and 1,
      respectively, an end to end cryptographic signature can be
      calculated based on the entire HELLO message, including its
      unmodified Message Header.

   The security mechanisms suggested in [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>] with respect to
   confidentiality can be directly applied to this protocol.

   The algorithm for generating HELLO messages in <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a> specifies
   which 1-hop neighbor network addresses may be included in the Address
   Blocks, and with which associated Address Block TLVs.  These Address
   Block TLVs may have Type = LINK_STATUS or Type = OTHER_NEIGHB, or
   both.  Address Block TLVs with Type = LINK_STATUS may have three
   possible Values (Value = HEARD, Value = SYMMETRIC, or Value = LOST),
   and Address Block TLVs of TYPE = OTHER_NEIGHB may have two possible
   Values (Value = SYMMETRIC or Value = LOST).  When both Address Block
   TLVs are associated with the same network address only certain
   combinations of these Address Block TLV Values are necessary, and are
   the only combinations generated by the algorithm in <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>.
   These combinations are indicated in Table 9.

   Cells labeled with "Yes" indicate the possible combinations that are
   generated by the algorithm in <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>.  Cells labeled with "No"
   indicate combinations not generated by the algorithm in <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>
   but that are correctly parsed and interpreted by the algorithm in
   <a href="#section-12">Section 12</a>.  The cell labeled with "No*" is actually inconsistent, it
   is handled by ignoring the Address Block TLV with Type =
   OTHER_NEIGHB, but SHOULD NOT be used.

   HELLO messages are instances of [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>] messages, and this protocol
   supports any combination of message header options and address
   encodings, enabled by [<a href="rfc5444.html" title='"Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format"'>RFC5444</a>] that convey the required information.
   As a consequence, there is no single way to represent how all HELLO
   messages look.  This appendix illustrates two HELLO message with
   similar content, the exact values included are explained in the
   following text.

   The HELLO message's four bit Message Flags (MF) field has value 7
   indicating that the message header contains hop limit, hop count, and
   message sequence number fields.  Its four bit Message Address Length
   (MAL) field has value 3, indicating addresses in the message have a
   length of four octets, here being IPv4 addresses.  The message is as
   transmitted, with a hop limit of 1 and a hop count of 0.  The overall
   message length is 45 octets.

   The message contains a Message TLV Block with content length 8 octets

   Length of 1 octet.  The Values included are time codes (as defined in
   [<a href="rfc5497.html" title='"Representing Multi-Value Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5497</a>]) representing the parameters H_HOLD_TIME and
   HELLO_INTERVAL, respectively.

   The message has a single Address Block containing 5 addresses.  The
   Address Block Flags octet (ABF) value 128 indicates an address Head
   but no address Tail, and no address prefixes.  The Head Length of 3
   octets indicates address Mid sections of one octet each (Mid 0 to Mid
   4).

   The following Address Block TLV Block (content length 14 octets)
   includes two Address Block TLVs.  The first is a LOCAL_IF Address
   Block TLV with Flags octet (ATLVF) value 80, which indicates that a
   single address, with index 0 (i.e., the address Head:Mid 0) is the
   single local interface address of this router (the one octet Value
   THIS_IF indicates that this address is of this interface).  The
   second is a LINK_STATUS Address Block TLV with Flags octet (ATLVF)
   value 52, which specifies the link status values of all reported
   neighbors in a single multivalue Address Block TLV that covers the
   addresses with indexes 1 to 4, inclusive.  The Address Block TLV
   Value Length of 4 octets indicates one octet per Value per address.
   The last four addresses thus are of neighbors, each an with
   associated link status: the first and second HEARD, the third
   SYMMETRIC, and the fourth LOST.

   This protocol specifies one Message Type, the HELLO message.  The
   maximum size of a HELLO message is proportional to the size of the
   originating router's 1-hop neighborhood.  HELLO messages MUST NOT be
   forwarded.

   A router MUST report its 1-hop neighborhood in HELLO messages on each
   of its MANET interfaces at least each REFRESH_INTERVAL.  This puts a
   lower bound on the control traffic generated by each router in the
   network employing this protocol.

   A router MUST ensure that two successive HELLO messages sent on the
   same MANET interface are separated by at least HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL.
   (If using jitter, then this may be reduced to a mean minimum value of
   HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL - HP_MAXJITTER/2.)  Thus, this puts an upper bound
   on the control traffic generated by each router in the network
   employing this protocol.

   This informative appendix illustrates the relationship between
   message timers and intervals.  (The adjustments to this timing when
   using timing jitter, as defined in [<a href="rfc5148.html" title='"Jitter Considerations in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5148</a>], are not shown.)

   Figure 1 illustrates a basic HELLO message schedule for a router, on
   a MANET interface, employing strictly periodic transmission of HELLO
   messages.  The router transmits a HELLO message each HELLO_INTERVAL.
   Each HELLO message contains all 1-hop neighbor network addresses of
   the router that are to be reported in any such HELLO message.  (The
   parameter REFRESH_INTERVAL, not shown, is in this example equal to
   the parameter HELLO_INTERVAL.)

   The router includes a VALIDITY_TIME TLV in each HELLO message,
   encoding the parameter H_HOLD_TIME, the duration for which
   information received in the HELLO message should be considered valid
   by receiving routers.  Receiving routers will, when recording the
   information received in the HELLO message, each use this for setting
   the L_HEARD_time, L_SYM_time and L_time elements of their
   corresponding Link Tuple, and the N2_time in the corresponding 2-Hop
   Tuple for each network address.  Only L_time is illustrated in
   Figure 1.

   Figure 2 illustrates a message schedule similar to Figure 1, where
   the router announces its own presence more frequently by sending
   additional HELLO messages.  HELLO messages are still sent regularly,
   at a reduced interval defined by a new value of HELLO_INTERVAL.
   However, REFRESH_INTERVAL has not been reduced.  Each 1-hop neighbor
   network address included in these HELLO messages need be advertised
   only once within each REFRESH_INTERVAL.  Consequently, the additional
   HELLO messages due to the reduced value of HELLO_INTERVAL may
   therefore be empty.  (This is not the only allowed distribution of
   1-hop neighbor network addresses, they could, for example, be sent
   alternately a, b and c, d.)

   HELLO messages may also be sent in response to events.  The minimal
   interval between two successive HELLO message transmissions by a
   router is HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL, setting an upper bound of the HELLO
   message emission rate.  Hence, for each HELLO message transmission, a
   router must wait at least HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL before the next HELLO
   message transmission.  Similarly, the maximum interval between two
   successive HELLO message transmissions is HELLO_INTERVAL, setting a
   lower bound on the message transmission rate.  Hence, for each HELLO
   message transmission, the router must ensure that the next HELLO
   message transmission must not wait more than HELLO_INTERVAL.

   Figure 3 illustrates a message schedule similar to Figure 1, but with
   HELLO messages responding to events at maximum rate, i.e., with HELLO
   messages being sent each HELLO_MIN_INTERVAL.  Note that when a HELLO
   message is sent, it is assumed that the following messages may all be
   scheduled at an interval of HELLO_INTERVAL, and hence each HELLO
   message contains all 1-hop neighbor network addresses.  In each HELLO
   message in this example, a new 1-hop neighbor network address is
   added, reflecting the changes occurring since the last HELLO message
   was sent.  HELLO messages are sent at the maximum allowed rate in
   order to signal these changes as rapidly as possible.

   There are three other timing parameters that are used by a router to
   control HELLO message generation and processing.

   Figure 9 illustrates the time, with duration L_HOLD_TIME, during
   which the appropriate network addresses of a formerly, but no longer,
   symmetric 1-hop neighbor, as connected by this MANET interface, are
   advertised as LOST using a LINK_STATUS TLV in HELLO messages on this
   MANET interface, thus allowing that 1-hop neighbor to update its Link
   Set accordingly.

   This appendix illustrates various examples of physical topologies, as
   well as how these are logically recorded by NHDP from the point of
   view of the router A.  This representation is a composite of
   information that would be contained within A's various Information
   Bases after NHDP has been running for sufficiently long time for the
   state to converge.

   Note that the examples given in this appendix are NOT exhaustive, but
   are selected to be illustrative of NHDP neighborhood representations
   of physical MANET topologies.

   The example topologies presented contain 3 physical routers A, B, and
   C.   Each of these routers has one or two distinct interfaces,
   denoted "top" and "bottom".  Each interface has one or two addresses,
   and symmetric connectivity between a pair of interfaces is
   illustrated by these being connected by a line.

   In all examples, the topology is described as it is recorded by NHDP
   in router A.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/F.1.%20%20Example%201%3A%20Standard%20Single%20Interface%20Topology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-F.1" name="appendix-F.1">F.1</a>.  Example 1: Standard Single Interface Topology</span>

   In Figure 12, each router has a single interface, each with a single
   IP address.  This is the simplest possible network, and the resulting
   representation is given to the right in Figure 12.

                 Corresponding NHDP Representation (Right)

   The Local Information Set in A contains a single Local Interface
   Tuple that has an I_local_iface_addr_list of {1}.  This value is
   denoted with a {1} on the leftmost part of the resulting
   representation.

   The Interface Information Base has only one Link Set, which
   represents the "top" interface of A, or {1}.  This Link Set's only
   Link Tuple has an L_neighbor_iface_addr_list containing {2}; this
   corresponds to the dashed line from {1} to {2} to the right in
   Figure 12.  The 2-Hop Set contains a single 2-Hop Tuple, with
   N2_neighbor_iface_addr_list being {2} and N2_2hop_addr being {3};
   this corresponds to the dashed line from {2} to {3} to the right in
   Figure 12.

   The descriptions of the following examples in this appendix will be
   derived similarly, and use the same notational conventions.

     Figure 21: Dual Addresses, with All Routers Having Two Interfaces
           (Left) and Corresponding NHDP Representation (Right)

   This example is the combination of all the preceding examples in this
   appendix.  The Local Information Set in A contains Local Information
   Tuples for each of its interfaces, and each Interface Information
   Base contains in its Link Set a representation of links {1,2}-{5,6}
   or {3,4}-{7,8}, respectively.  The Neighbor Set (in the Neighbor
   Information Base) records the existence of router B and all of its
   addresses on all its interfaces, i.e., {5,6,7,8}.

   As in Example 9, each interface address of router C is represented in
   the 2-Hop Set of each Interface Information Base as a link from
   router B to each of these addresses.  Router A does not have
   information describing which of router B's interfaces is connected to
   which interface of C, nor that the addresses {9}, {10}, {11}, and
   {12} are addresses of the same router (or that some of these, such as
   {9} and {10}, are addresses on the same interface of the router).

   In Figure 22, all routers have a single interface, except for router
   A which has two.  Each of A's two interfaces has a link with the
   single interface of router B.  All interfaces have a single address.

    Linked to the Single Interface of B (Left), and Corresponding NHDP
                          Representation (Right)

   This is similar to Example 8, except that the single address {2} also
   replaces the address {5}.  In particular, both Link Tuples (one in
   each Link Set, each in its corresponding Interface Information Base)
   have L_neighbor_iface_addr_list being {2}, the Neighbor Set (in the
   Neighbor Information Base) contains a single Neighbor Tuple with
   N_neighbor_addr_list being {2}, and both 2-Hop Tuples (one in each
   2-Hop Set, each in its corresponding Interface Information Base) have
   N2_neighbor_iface_addr_list being {2} and N2_2hop_addr being {3}.
