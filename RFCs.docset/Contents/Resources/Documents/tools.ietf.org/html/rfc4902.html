Abstract

   The Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) framework is application
   agnostic.  Application-specific adaptations extend that framework.
   Previous work has focused on HTTP and work for SMTP is in progress.
   These protocols differ fundamentally in the way data flows, and it
   turns out that existing OPES requirements and IAB considerations for
   OPES need to be reviewed with regards to how well they fit for SMTP
   adaptation.  This document analyzes aspects about the integrity of
   SMTP and mail message adaptation by OPES systems and about privacy
   and security issues when the OPES framework is adapted to SMTP.  It
   also lists requirements that must be considered when creating the
   "SMTP adaptation with OPES" document.

   The intent of this document is to capture this information before the
   current OPES working group shuts down.  This is to provide input for
   subsequent working groups or individual contributors that may pick up
   the OPES/SMTP work at a later date.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Because OPES is a protocol that is built over application layer
   transports, its security may depend on the specifics of the
   transport.  OPES designs are guided by the IAB considerations for
   OPES document [<a href="#ref-2" title='"IAB Architectural and Policy Considerations for Open Pluggable Edge Services"'>2</a>], and those considerations are revisited here in the
   context of the SMTP protocol.

   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> of the OPES SMTP use cases document [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) SMTP Use Cases"'>6</a>] maps some email and
   SMTP elements to OPES names that are used in this document.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Differences%20between%20Unidirectional%20and%20Bidirectional%20Application"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Differences between Unidirectional and Bidirectional Application</span>
<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Protocols"></a>      Protocols</span>

   The IAB listed considerations for Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES)
   in [<a href="#ref-2" title='"IAB Architectural and Policy Considerations for Open Pluggable Edge Services"'>2</a>] and OPES treatment of those considerations has been discussed
   in [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) Treatment of IAB Considerations"'>3</a>].  Both documents make use of HTTP as an example for the
   underlying protocol in OPES flows, and focus on web protocols that
   have requests and responses in the classic form (client sends a
   request to a server that replies with a response of the same protocol
   within a single protocol transaction).

   <a href="rfc3914.html">RFC 3914</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) Treatment of IAB Considerations"'>3</a>] already indicates that other protocols may not fit in
   this context, for example in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>, "Moreover, some application
   protocols may not have explicit responses...".

   When using SMTP there are still client and server applications, and
   requests and responses handled within SMTP, but email messages are
   sent by the data provider to the recipients (data consumers) without
   a previous request.  At that abstraction layer, email delivery via
   SMTP is a unidirectional process and different from the previously
   handled web protocols such as HTTP.  For example, bypass has been
   defined for OPES, so far, by the data consumer requesting an OPES
   bypass by adding information to the application protocol request; the
   OPES system can then react on the bypass request in both the
   application request and response.  For SMTP, the data consumer (email
   recipient) cannot request in-band that the OPES bypass handling of
   his/her messages.

   The IAB considerations need to be revisited and special requirements
   may be needed for OPES handling of SMTP.

   A large number of email filters are deployed at SMTP gateways today.
   In fact, all use cases listed in "OPES SMTP Use Cases" [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) SMTP Use Cases"'>6</a>] are
   already deployed, often in non-standardized ways.  This opens a
   number of integrity, privacy, and security concerns that are not

   addressed, and SMTP itself does not provide effective measures to
   detect and defend against compromised implementations.

   OPES will most likely not be able to solve these issues completely,
   but at least should be able to improve the situation to some extent.

   The SMTP specifications [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>4</a>] require that NDRs (Non-Delivery Reports)
   be sent to the originator of an undeliverable mail that has been
   accepted by an SMTP server.  But it has become common practice for
   some sorts of mail (spam, worms) to be silently dropped without
   sending an NDR, a violation of the MUST statement of SMTP (see
   Section 3.7 of [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>4</a>]).  While the user of a web protocol notices if a
   resource cannot be fetched, neither the email sender nor email
   recipient may notice that an email was not delivered.  These kind of
   issues already exist and are not introduced by OPES.

   Adding SMTP adaptations with OPES allows us to define a standardized
   way for SMTP gateway filtering, to offload filtering services to
   callout servers and address a number of the integrity, privacy, and
   security issues.  OPES offers methods to add OPES tracing information
   and to request a bypass of filtering, and by that can make email
   gateway filtering a more reliable and standardized function.  But
   OPES won't make email delivery via SMTP a reliable communication.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.5.%20%20Limitations%20of%20OPES%20in%20Regards%20to%20Fixing%20SMTP%20Issues"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.5" name="section-1.5">1.5</a>.  Limitations of OPES in Regards to Fixing SMTP Issues</span>

   The biggest concerns when adding OPES services to a network flow are
   that compromised, misconfigured, or faulty OPES systems may change
   messages in a way that the consumer can no longer read them or that
   messages are no longer delivered at all.

   Defining a standard way to mark mails that have been handled by OPES
   systems is fairly simple and does not require new techniques by SMTP
   gateways; they already today MUST leave tracing information by adding
   "Received" headers to mails.  Therefore, recipients receiving broken
   mail have a fair chance of finding the compromised OPES system by
   using the trace information.  There is still no guarantee, as the
   email may have been broken in a way that makes even the tracing
   information unreadable.  But the chance will be even better than with
   other protocols such as HTTP, because most email clients allow the
   user to display mail headers, while many browsers have no mechanism
   to show the HTTP headers that might include tracing info.

   Tracing OPES operations is an important requirement for OPES systems.
   Tracing information added to email should follow a similar syntax and
   structure to that defined for OPES/HTTP in HTTP Adaptation with Open
   Pluggable Edge Services [<a href="#ref-5" title='"HTTP Adaptation with Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES)"'>5</a>], and with the same guidelines as the SMTP
   specifications [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>4</a>] defined for the "Received" headers.  (We do not
   specify here whether "Received" headers would be used to carry the
   OPES information, or new trace headers should be defined, such as
   OPES-System and OPES-Via.)

   OPES/SMTP specifications defining tracing requirements MUST be
   compliant with the general OPES tracing requirements defined in OPES
   Entities &amp; End Points Communication [<a href="#ref-12" title='"Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) Entities and End Points Communication"'>12</a>], but MAY further restrict
   those.  For example, they might require the following: that the OPES
   processor must add tracing information for the OPES system before
   calling the first callout server; that it has to augment the tracing
   information with additional data if necessary after the message
   returns from each service it is calling; and that it must ensure that
   the tracing information has not been deleted by an OPES service
   before it forwards the SMTP message.

   Trace information can then be seen by mail recipients when the mail
   message reaches the recipient.

   Mail that cannot be delivered or that is blocked by the OPES service
   will either be rejected or cannot be delivered after it has been
   accepted by an SMTP server.  In the latter case, SMTP specifications
   [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>4</a>] require that an NDR MUST be sent to the originator; OPES further
   requires that an NDR generated due to OPES processing MUST also
   contain information about the OPES system so that the sender gets

   informed.  If an email is rejected at the SMTP protocol level due to
   OPES processing, an OPES system MUST also include trace data in the
   SMTP response so that the originator can find out why and where the
   mail was rejected.

   If a mail message was rejected or could not be delivered (and an NDR
   was sent), the originator of the message may want to bypass the OPES
   system that blocked the message.

   If the recipient of a message receives a mail with OPES trace
   information, he may want to receive a non-OPES version of the
   message.  Although there is no direct in-band request from the
   recipient back to the OPES system, the recipient can contact the
   sender and ask her to send the message again and to add a bypass
   request for the OPES system.  Not all OPES systems will be allowed to
   fulfill a bypass request according to their policy.  For example,
   malware scanners should not be bypassed.  But other OPES services are
   good candidates for bypass requests, such as language translation of
   the email message.  Translation could be bypassed after the recipient
   has noticed that the translated result does not meet his/her
   expectations and that the original message would be preferred.

   An OPES system MAY also define out-of-band methods to request a
   bypass, for example, a web interface or an email message sent to the
   server that results in the creation of a white list entry for the
   sender/recipient pair.  Examples for these out-of-band methods are
   email systems that keep a copy of the original email in a quarantine
   queue and only send the recipient a block notification, plus either a
   direct link or a digest notification, with the ability to retrieve
   the original message from quarantine.  These out-of-band methods are
   typically offered by spam filters today.

   OPES MUST implement methods to request a bypass, but there cannot be
   a guarantee that the bypass request will be approved.  The security
   needs of the receiver or the receiver's network may demand that
   certain filters must not be bypassed (such as virus scanners).  In
   general, the receiver should be able to configure a client centric
   OPES system, i.e. the receiver should be able to indicate if he/she
   wants to receive a non-OPES version if it is available.

   Bypass requests could be added to the mail message or within the SMTP
   dialog.  Bypass request data added to the mail message cannot bypass
   OPES services that operate on other SMTP dialog commands, which are
   sent before the mail message has been received (such as RCPT
   commands).

   Cryptography can be used to assure message privacy, to authenticate
   the originator of messages, and to detect message modification.
   There are standard methods for achieving some or all these
   protections for generic messages ([<a href="#ref-9" title='"MIME Security with OpenPGP"'>9</a>], [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)"'>10</a>], [<a href="#ref-11" title='"(Extensible Markup Language) XML-Signature Syntax and Processing"'>11</a>]), and these can be
   used to protect SMTP data without changing the SMTP protocol.

   The content of encrypted mail messages cannot be inspected by OPES
   systems because only the intended recipient has the information
   necessary for decryption.  The IAB and others have suggested that
   users might want to share that information with OPES systems, thus
   permitting decryption by intermediates.  For most cryptographic
   systems that are compatible with email, this would require end users
   to share their most valuable keys, in essence their "identities",
   with OPES machines.  Some key management systems, particularly those
   which have centralized administrative control of keys, might have
   trust models in which such sharing would be sensible and secure.

   After decrypting the message, an OPES box that modified the content
   would be faced with the task of re-encrypting it in order to maintain
   some semblance of "end-to-end" privacy.

   If OPES/SMTP had a way to interact with end users on a per-message
   basis, it might be possible to communicate cryptographic key
   information from individual messages to end users, have them compute
   the message encrypting key for particular message, and to send that
   back to the OPES box.  This would perhaps ameliorate the need to
   share a user's "master" message decrypting key with the OPES box.
   This kind of communication has not been defined for OPES.

   Message protection systems generally include some message integrity
   mechanisms by which a recipient can check for a message modification
   that may have occurred after the sender released the message.  This
   protection can be applied to encrypted or plaintext messages and can
   be accomplished through either symmetric or asymmetric cryptography.
   In the case of symmetric cryptography, the key sharing problem is
   exactly similar to the encryption case discussed previously.  If the
   OPES box modified the content, then the message integrity (or
   authentication) code would have to be recalculated and included with
   the modified message.





<span class="grey">Stecher                      Informational                      [Page 7]</span></pre>

   For asymmetric cryptography the situation is more complicated.  The
   message integrity is tied to the sender's public key, and although
   anyone who can get the sender's public key can also check for a
   message modification, no one but the sender can compute the sender's
   signature on a modified message.  Thus, an OPES system could not
   modify messages and have them appear to come from the purported
   sender.  The notion of sharing the sender's signing key with the OPES
   system is unpalatable because few trust models would be compatible
   with sharing digital identities across organization boundaries.
   However, if the OPES system doing the modification were under the
   control of the sender's local administration, the sharing might be
   sensible (as discussed for decryption, above).

   OPES/SMTP systems could present modified content showing the modified
   regions in a form that permits the authentication of the original
   message and authentication of the OPES modifications (assuming the
   OPES box had a digital signature identity and key).  One method for
   doing this is outlined in [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Data Integrity for Mildly Active Content"'>13</a>], but to our knowledge this method is
   not in any standard.

   There are security risks associated with sharing cryptographic keys
   that must be addressed by implementers.  Because this is not a simple
   task, it is not a requirement for OPES/SMTP.

   In addition to other documents listing requirements for OPES, the
   discussion in this document implies specific requirements for
   designing and implementing SMTP adaptations with OPES:

   o  OPES Systems MUST add tracing headers to mail messages

   o  If an email message that has been accepted by an OPES system
      cannot be delivered, the non-delivery report MUST include trace
      information of the OPES system.

   o  The OPES/SMTP specifications MUST define a bypass request option
      that can be included in mail messages.

   o  The OPES/SMTP specifications MUST define a bypass request option
      as an extension for SMTP dialogs.

   This section lists the IAB considerations for OPES [<a href="#ref-2" title='"IAB Architectural and Policy Considerations for Open Pluggable Edge Services"'>2</a>] and summarizes
   how OPES/SMTP addresses them.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20IAB%20Consideration%20%282.1%29%20One-Party%20Consent"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  IAB Consideration (2.1) One-Party Consent</span>

   The IAB recommends that all OPES services be explicitly authorized by
   one of the application-layer end-hosts (that is, either the data
   consumer application or the data provider application).  For OPES/
   SMTP, this means consent of either the email message sender or the
   recipient.

   The application agnostic architecture of OPES [<a href="#ref-7" title='"An Architecture for Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES)"'>7</a>] requires that "OPES
   processors MUST be consented to by either the data consumer or data
   provider application" (OPES processor is the email gateway for OPES/
   SMTP).  This cannot prevent the consent-less introduction of OPES
   processors by noncompliant OPES entities.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20IAB%20Consideration%20%282.2%29%20IP-Layer%20Communications"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  IAB Consideration (2.2) IP-Layer Communications</span>

   The IAB recommends that OPES processors must be explicitly addressed
   at the IP layer by the end user (data consumer application).

   This requirement has been addressed by the architecture requirements
   in Section 2.1 of [<a href="#ref-7" title='"An Architecture for Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES)"'>7</a>] and has been further clarified in <a href="#section-2.2">Section 2.2</a>
   of [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) Treatment of IAB Considerations"'>3</a>].

   intermediaries that are deemed inappropriate by the content provider"
   [<a href="#ref-2" title='"IAB Architectural and Policy Considerations for Open Pluggable Edge Services"'>2</a>].

   For OPES/SMTP this translates into assistance for the email message
   sender to detect and respond to recipient-centric actions that are
   deemed inappropriate by the sender.

   This has been addressed in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> and by the second tracing
   requirements in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  As discussed in <a href="#section-1.3">Section 1.3</a>, OPES/SMTP
   cannot fix cases where NDRs are not sent or get blocked before
   reaching the sender of the original message.

   This is addressed in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a> and by the first tracing requirement
   in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.  It must be noted that some email systems do not make
   the email headers available to the end user, although the headers
   belong to the payload that is transferred via SMTP.  Building an OPES
   architecture with those email systems should be avoided or requires
   that the tracing information be made available to the end users in a
   different way.

   retrieving this "non-OPES" version from the content provider" [<a href="#ref-2" title='"IAB Architectural and Policy Considerations for Open Pluggable Edge Services"'>2</a>].

   For OPES/SMTP, this has been discussed in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> and is

   While "most application layer addressing revolves around URIs"
   (section 8 of [<a href="#ref-2" title='"IAB Architectural and Policy Considerations for Open Pluggable Edge Services"'>2</a>]), SMTP uses email addresses, for which the
   considerations only apply to some degree.

   The SMTP use cases document [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) SMTP Use Cases"'>6</a>] includes a use case for Mail
   Rerouting and Address Rewriting.  Alias and email list address
   resolution are standard functions of an email gateway described in
   [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Simple Mail Transfer Protocol"'>4</a>].

   Translating the reference validity consideration regarding inter- and
   intra-document reference validity to SMTP, OPES services mapping
   internal to external email addresses MUST ensure the proper mapping
   of addresses in all affected email headers.
