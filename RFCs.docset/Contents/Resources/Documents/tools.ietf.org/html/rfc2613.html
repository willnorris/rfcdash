   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   - An overall architecture, described in <a href="rfc2571.html">RFC 2571</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>1</a>].

   - Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
     16, <a href="rfc1155.html">RFC 1155</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP-based Internets"'>2</a>], STD 16, <a href="rfc1212.html">RFC 1212</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Concise MIB Definitions"'>3</a>] and <a href="rfc1215.html">RFC 1215</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"A Convention for Defining Traps for use with the SNMP"'>4</a>]. The second
     version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC 2578</a> [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)"'>5</a>], <a href="rfc2579.html">RFC</a>
     <a href="rfc2579.html">2579</a> [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Textual Conventions for SMIv2"'>6</a>] and <a href="rfc2580.html">RFC 2580</a> [<a href="#ref-7" title='"Conformance Statements for SMIv2"'>7</a>].

   - Message protocols for transferring management information. The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>8</a>]. A second version of the SNMP
     message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
     protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in <a href="rfc1901.html">RFC 1901</a> [<a href="#ref-9" title='"Introduction to Community-based SNMPv2"'>9</a>] and <a href="rfc1906.html">RFC</a>
     <a href="rfc1906.html">1906</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>10</a>].  The third version of the message protocol is called
     SNMPv3 and described in <a href="rfc1906.html">RFC 1906</a> [<a href="#ref-10" title='"Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>10</a>], <a href="rfc2572.html">RFC 2572</a> [<a href="#ref-11" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>11</a>] and <a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a>
     [<a href="#ref-12" title='"User-based Security Model for Version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>12</a>].

   - Protocol operations for accessing management information. The first
     set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described
     in STD 15, <a href="rfc1157.html">RFC 1157</a> [<a href="#ref-8" title='"Simple Network Management Protocol"'>8</a>]. A second set of protocol operations and
     associated PDU formats is described in <a href="rfc1905.html">RFC 1905</a> [<a href="#ref-13" title='"Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2)"'>13</a>].

   - A set of fundamental applications described in <a href="rfc2573.html">RFC 2573</a> [<a href="#ref-14" title='"SNMP Applications"'>14</a>] and
     the view-based access control mechanism described in <a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="#ref-15" title='"View-based Access Control Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>15</a>].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED","MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-24" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>24</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Overview"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Overview</span>

   This document continues the architecture created in the RMON MIB [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base"'>17</a>]
   by providing RMON analysis for switched networks (SMON).

   Remote network monitoring devices, often called monitors or probes,
   are instruments that exist for the purpose of managing a network.
   Often these remote probes are stand-alone devices and devote
   significant internal resources for the sole purpose of managing a
   network.  An organization may employ many of these devices, one per
   network segment, to manage its internet. In addition, these devices
   may be used for a network management service provider to access a
   client network, often geographically remote.

   The objects defined in this document are intended as an interface
   between an RMON agent and an RMON management application and are not
   intended for direct manipulation by humans.  While some users may
   tolerate the direct display of some of these objects, few will
   tolerate the complexity of manually manipulating objects to
   accomplish row creation.  These functions should be handled by the
   management application.

   o Offline Operation

     There are sometimes conditions when a management station will not
     be in constant contact with its remote monitoring devices.  This is
     sometimes by design in an attempt to lower communications costs





<span class="grey">Waterman, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2613.html">RFC 2613</a>                        SMON MIB                       June 1999</span>


     (especially when communicating over a WAN or dialup link), or by
     accident as network failures affect the communications between the
     management station and the probe.

     For this reason, this MIB allows a probe to be configured to
     perform diagnostics and to collect statistics continuously, even
     when communication with the management station may not be possible
     or efficient.  The probe may then attempt to notify the management
     station when an exceptional condition occurs.  Thus, even in
     circumstances where communication between management station and
     probe is not continuous, fault, performance, and configuration
     information may be continuously accumulated and communicated to the
     management station conveniently and efficiently.

   o Proactive Monitoring

     Given the resources available on the monitor, it is potentially
     helpful for it continuously to run diagnostics and to log network
     performance.  The monitor is always available at the onset of any
     failure.  It can notify the management station of the failure and
     can store historical statistical information about the failure.
     This historical information can be played back by the management
     station in an attempt to perform further diagnosis into the cause
     of the problem.

   o Problem Detection and Reporting

     The monitor can be configured to recognize conditions, most notably
     error conditions, and continuously to check for them.  When one of
     these conditions occurs, the event may be logged, and management
     stations may be notified in a number of ways.

   o Value Added Data

     Because a remote monitoring device represents a network resource
     dedicated exclusively to network management functions, and because
     it is located directly on the monitored portion of the network, the
     remote network monitoring device has the opportunity to add
     significant value to the data it collects.  For instance, by
     highlighting those hosts on the network that generate the most
     traffic or errors, the probe can give the management station
     precisely the information it needs to solve a class of problems.

   o Multiple Managers

     An organization may have multiple management stations for different
     units of the organization, for different functions (e.g.
     engineering and operations), and in an attempt to provide disaster

     recovery.  Because environments with multiple management stations
     are common, the remote network monitoring device has to deal with
     more than one management station, potentially using its resources
     concurrently.

   This document addresses issues related to applying "Remote
   Technology" to Switch Networks. Switches today differ from standard
   shared media protocols:

   1)   Data is not, in general, broadcast.  This MAY be caused by the
        switch architecture  or by the connection-oriented nature of the
        data. This means, therefore, that monitoring non-broadcast
        traffic needs to be considered.

   2)   Monitoring the multiple entry and exit points from a switching
        device requires a vast amount of resources - memory and CPU, and
        aggregation of the data in logical packets of information,
        determined by the application needs.

   3)   Switching incorporates logical segmentation such as Virtual LANs
        (VLANs).

   4)   Switching incorporates packet prioritization.

   5)   Data across the switch fabric can be in the form of cells. Like
        RMON, SMON is only concerned with the monitoring of packets.

   Differences such as these make monitoring difficult.  The current
   RMON and RMON 2 standards do not provide for things that are unique
   to switches or switched environments.

   In order to overcome the limitations of the existing standards, new
   monitoring mechanisms have been implemented by vendors of switching
   equipment. All these monitoring strategies are currently proprietary
   in nature.

   This document provides the framework to include different switching
   strategies and allow for monitoring operations consistent with the
   RMON framework. This MIB is limited to monitoring and control
   operations aimed at providing monitoring data for RMON probes.

   The following mechanisms are used by SMON devices, for the purpose of
   monitoring switched networks.

   The RMON MIB standard [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base"'>17</a>] defines data source objects which point to
   MIB-II interfaces, identified by instances of ifIndex objects.

   The SMON MIB extends this concept and allows for other types of
   objects to be defined as data sources for RMON and/or SMON data.
   Three forms of dataSources are described:

      ifIndex.&lt;I&gt;

         Traditional RMON dataSources. Called 'port-based' for
         ifType.&lt;I&gt; not equal to 'propVirtual(53)'. &lt;I&gt; is the ifIndex
         value (see [<a href="#ref-22" title='" The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>22</a>]).

      smonVlanDataSource.&lt;V&gt;

         A dataSource of this form refers to a 'Packet-based VLAN' and
         is called a 'VLAN-based' dataSource. &lt;V&gt; is the VLAN ID as
         defined by the IEEE 802.1Q standard [<a href="#ref-19" title='"Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Common specifications - Part 3: Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges: Revision (Incorporating IEEE P802.1p: Traffic Class Expediting and Dynamic Multicast Filtering)"'>19</a>]. The value is between
         1 and 4094 inclusive, and it represents an 802.1Q VLAN-ID with
         global scope within a given bridged domain, as defined by [<a href="#ref-19" title='"Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Common specifications - Part 3: Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges: Revision (Incorporating IEEE P802.1p: Traffic Class Expediting and Dynamic Multicast Filtering)"'>19</a>].

      entPhysicalEntry.&lt;N&gt;

         A dataSource of this form refers to a physical entity within
         the agent and is called an 'entity-based' dataSource. &lt;N&gt; is
         the value of the entPhysicalIndex in the entPhysicalTable (see
         [<a href="#ref-18" title='"Entity MIB"'>18</a>]).

   In addition to these new dataSource types, SMON introduces a new
   group called dataSourceCapsTable to aid an NMS in discovering
   dataSource identity and attributes.

   The extended data source mechanism supported by the SMON MIB allows
   for the use of external collection points, similar to the one defined
   and supported by the RMON and RMON 2 MIBs, as well as internal
   collection points (e.g. propVirtual ifTable entry, entPhysicalEntry).
   The latter reflects either data sources which MAY be the result of
   aggregation (e.g. switch-wide) or internal channels of physical
   entities, which have the capability of being monitored by an SMON
   probe.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.2%20Copy%20Port"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.2" name="section-2.3.2">2.3.2</a> Copy Port</span>

   In order to make the switching devices support RMON statistics, many
   vendors have implemented a port copy feature, allowing traffic to be
   replicated from switch port to switch port. Several levels of
   configuration are possible:

      1) 1 source port to 1 destination port
      2) N source ports to 1 destination port
      3) N source ports to M destination ports

   The SMON standard presents a standard MIB interface which allows for
   the control of this function.

   Note that this function can apply to devices that have no other SMON
   or RMON functionality than  copy port. The agent of such a device
   would support only the portCopyCaps and the portCopyConfig MIB
   groups, out of the whole SMON MIB.  Switch vendors are encouraged to
   implement this subset of the SMON MIB, as it would allow for standard
   port copy configuration from the same NMS application that does RMON
   or SMON.

   Port copy may cause congestion problems on the SMON device. This
   situation is more likely occur when copying from a port of higher
   speed to a port of lower speed or copy from multiple port to a single
   port.

   Particular implementations MAY chose to build protection mechanisms
   that would prevent creation of new port copy links when the capacity
   of the destination port is exceeded. The MIB allows for
   implementations to (if supported) instrument a destination drop count
   on port copy to provide NMS applications a sense of the quality of
   data presented at the destination port.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.3%20VLAN%20Monitoring"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3.3" name="section-2.3.3">2.3.3</a> VLAN Monitoring</span>

   VLAN monitoring can be accomplished by using a VLAN-based dataSource
   and/or by configuring smonVlanIdStats and/or smonPrioStats
   collections.  These functions allow VLAN-ID or user priority
   distributions per dataSource. VLAN monitoring provides a high-level
   view of total VLAN usages and relative non-unicast traffic usage as
   well as a profile of VLAN priority as defined in the 3-bit
   user_priority field.

   NOTE: priority statistics reflect what was parsed from the packet,
   not what priority, if any, was necessarily granted by the switch.

   The Remote Monitoring MIB (RMON) [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base"'>17</a>] provides several management
   functions that MAY be directly or indirectly applicable to switched
   networks.

   The port copy mechanisms defined by the SMON MIB allow for the
   destination ports to become a data source for any RMON statistics.
   However, an NMS application SHOULD check whether it is in the device
   capability (portCopyCap) to filter errors from a source to a
   destination port and whether this capability is enabled, in order to
   provide a correct interpretation of the copied port traffic.

   RMON host and matrix group statistics entries MAY be aggregated by
   use of the extended dataSource capability defined in SMON. RMON 2
   groups are similarly extended through the use of SMON's dataSource
   definition.

   RMON also defines a simple thresholding monitoring mechanism, event-
   logging and event-notification for any MIB instance; SMON utilizes
   the alarms and events groups from RMON without modification.  These
   groups SHOULD be implemented on SMON devices if a simple thresholding
   mechanism is desired.

   The RMON 2 usrHistory group (user-defined history collection) SHOULD
   be implemented by an SMON device if a history collection mechanism is
   desired for smonStats entries.

   The SMON MIB utilizes the propVirtual(53) ifType defined in the
   Interfaces Group MIB [<a href="#ref-22" title='" The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>22</a>] to provide SMON and RMON with new
   dataSources such as VLANs and internal monitoring points. NMS
   applications SHOULD consult the SMON dataSource capabilities group
   (dataSourceCap) for a description of these virtual interfaces.

   The SMON MIB does not mandate Entity MIB [<a href="#ref-18" title='"Entity MIB"'>18</a>] support, but allows for
   physical entities, as defined by this MIB to be defined as SMON data
   sources. For such cases, the support for the entPhysicalTable is
   required.

   One of the important indicators for measuring the effectiveness of a
   switching device is the ratio between the number of forwarded frames
   and the number of dropped frames at the switch port.

   It is out of the scope of this MIB to provide instrumentation
   information relative to switching devices. However, such indication
   may be part of other MIB modules.

   For instance the Bridge MIB [<a href="#ref-23" title='"Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges"'>23</a>] provides such MIB objects, for the
   802.1 bridges (dot1dTpPortInFrames, dot1dTpPortInDiscards) and

   information.

   The SMON MIB provides simple statistics per VLAN and priority levels.
   Those two categories of statistics are important to managers of
   switched networks.  Interoperability for those features is ensured by
   the use of the IEEE 802.1 p/Q standards ([<a href="#ref-19" title='"Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Common specifications - Part 3: Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges: Revision (Incorporating IEEE P802.1p: Traffic Class Expediting and Dynamic Multicast Filtering)"'>19</a>], [<a href="#ref-20" title='"IEEE Standards for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks: Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks"'>20</a>]) defined by the
   IEEE 802.1 WG. Interoperability from the SMON MIB point of view is
   ensured by referencing the IEEE definition of VLANs and priority
   levels for the SMON statistics.

   The smonVlanStats MIB group includes the control and statistics
   objects related to 802.1Q VLANs. Specific statistics per 802.1Q
   virtual LAN are supported. The group provides a high level view of
   total VLAN usage, and relative non-unicast traffic usage.

   It is an implementation-specific matter as to how the agent
   determines the proper default-VLAN for untagged or priority-tagged
   frames.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3%20smonPrioStats"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a> smonPrioStats</span>

   The smonPrioStatsTable provides a distribution based on the
   user_priority field in the VLAN header.

   Note that this table merely reports priority as encoded in VLAN
   headers, not the priority (if any) given the frame for actual
   switching purposes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.4%20dataSourceCaps"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.4" name="section-3.4">3.4</a> dataSourceCaps</span>

   The dataSourceCaps MIB group identifies all supported data sources on
   an SMON device. An NMS MAY use this table to discover the RMON and
   Copy Port attributes of each data source.

   Upon restart of the agent, the dataSourceTable, ifTable and
   entPhysicalTable are initialized for the available data sources. The
   agent MAY modify these tables as data sources become known or are
   removed (e.g. hot swap of interfaces, chassis cards or the discovery
   of VLAN usage). It is understood that dataSources representing VLANs
   may not always be instantiated immediately upon restart, but rather
   as VLAN usage is detected by the agent.  The agent SHOULD attempt to
   create dataSource and interface entries for all dataSources as soon
   as possible.

   For each dataSourceCapsEntry representing a VLAN or entPhysicalEntry,
   the agent MUST create an associated ifEntry with a ifType value of
   associated dataSourceCapsIfIndex object.

   The rationale of the above derives from the fact that according to
   [<a href="#ref-16" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base Version 2 using SMIv2"'>16</a>] and [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base"'>17</a>] an RMON dataSource MUST be associated with an ifEntry.
   Specifically, the dataSourceCapsTable allows for an agent to map
   Entity MIB physical entities (e.g., switch backplanes) and entire
   VLANs to ifEntries with ifType "propVirtual(53)". This ifEntry values
   will be used as the actual values in RMON control table dataSource
   objects.  This allows for physical entities and VLANs to be treated
   as RMON data sources, and RMON functions to be applied to this type

   control of the port copy functionality in a device.

   The standard does not place a limit on the mode in which this copy
   function may be used:

   Mode 1 --  1:1 Copy

      Single dataSource copied to a single destination dataSource.
      Agent MAY limit configuration based on ifTypes, ifSpeeds, half-
      duplex/full-duplex, or agent resources.  In this mode the single
      instance of the portCopyDestDropEvents object refers to dropped
      frames on the portCopyDest interface.

   Mode 2 --  N:1 Copy

      Multiple dataSources copied to a single destination dataSource.
      Agent MAY limit configuration based on ifTypes, ifSpeeds, half-
      duplex/full-duplex, portCopyDest over-subscription, or agent
      resources.  In this mode all N instances of the
      portCopyDestDropEvents object SHOULD contain the same value, and
      refer to dropped frames on the portCopyDest interface.

   Mode 3 --  N:M Copy

      Multiple dataSources copied to multiple destination dataSources.
      Agent MAY limit configuration based on ifTypes, ifSpeeds, half-
      duplex/full-duplex, portCopyDest over-subscription, or agent
      resources.  Since portCopyDestDropEvents is kept per destination
      port, all instances of the portCopyDestDropEvents object
      associated with (indexed by) a given portCopyDest SHOULD have the
      same value (i.e. replicated or aliased for each instance
      associated with a given portCopyDest).

   The rows do not have an OwnerString, since multiple rows MAY be part
   of the same portCopy operation. The agent is expected to activate or
   deactivate entries one at a time, based on the rowStatus for the
   given row.  This can lead to unpredictable results in Modes 2 and 3
   in applications utilizing the portCopy target traffic, if multiple
   PDUs are used to fully configure the operation.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that an entire portCopy operation be configured in one SetRequest PDU
   if possible.

   The portCopyDest object MAY NOT reference an interface associated
   with a packet-based VLAN (smonVlanDataSource.&lt;V&gt;), but this
   dataSource type MAY be used as a portCopySource.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Control%20of%20Remote%20Network%20Monitoring%20Devices"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Control of Remote Network Monitoring Devices</span>

   Due to the complex nature of the available functions in these
   devices, the functions often need user configuration.  In many cases,
   the function requires parameters to be set up for a data collection
   operation.  The operation can proceed only after these parameters are
   fully set up.

   Many functional groups in this MIB have one or more tables in which
   to set up control parameters, and one or more data tables in which to
   place the results of the operation.  The control tables are typically
   read/write in nature, while the data tables are typically read-only.
   Because the parameters in the control table often describe resulting
   data in the data table, many of the parameters can be modified only
   when the control entry is not active.  Thus, the method for modifying
   these parameters is to de-activate the entry, perform the SNMP Set
   operations to modify the entry, and then re-activate the entry.
   Deleting the control entry causes the deletion of any associated data
   entries, which also gives a convenient method for reclaiming the
   resources used by the associated data.

   Some objects in this MIB provide a mechanism to execute an action on
   the remote monitoring device.  These objects MAY execute an action as
   a result of a change in the state of the object.  For those objects
   in this MIB, a request to set an object to the same value as it
   currently holds would thus cause no action to occur.

   To facilitate control by multiple managers, resources have to be
   shared among the managers.  These resources are typically the memory
   and computation resources that a function requires.

   The control mechanisms defined and used in this MIB are the same as
   those defined in the RMON MIB [<a href="#ref-17" title='"Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base"'>17</a>], for control functionality and
   interaction with multiple managers.

        these are static attributes, which SHOULD NOT be adjusted
        because of current resources or configuration.

      - countErrFrames(0)
          The agent sets this bit for the dataSource if errored frames
          received on this dataSource can actually be monitored by the
          agent The agent clears this bit if any errored frames are
          not visible to the RMON data collector.

      - countAllGoodFrames(1)
          The agent sets this bit for the dataSource if all good
          frames received on this dataSource can actually be monitored
          by the agent. The agent clears this bit if any good frames
          are not visible for RMON collection, e.g., the dataSource is
          a non-promiscuous interface or an internal switch interface
          which may not receive frames which were switched in hardware
          or dropped by the bridge forwarding function.

      - countAnyRmonTables(2)
          The agent sets this bit if this dataSource can actually be
          used in any of the implemented RMON tables, resources
          notwithstanding. The agent clears this bit if this
          dataSourceCapsEntry is present simply to identify a
          dataSource that may only be used as portCopySource and/or a
          portCopyDest, but not the source of an actual RMON data
          collection.

      - babyGiantsCountAsGood(3)
          The agent sets this bit if it can distinguish, for counting
          purposes, between true giant frames and frames that exceed
          Ethernet maximum frame size 1518 due to VLAN tagging ('baby
          giants'). Specifically, this BIT means that frames up to
          1522 octets are counted as good.

          Agents not capable of detecting 'baby giants' will clear
          this bit and will view all frames less than or equal to 1518
          octets as 'good frames' and all frames larger than 1518
          octets as 'bad frames' for the purpose of counting in the
          smonVlanIdStats and smonPrioStats tables.

          Agents capable of detecting 'baby giants' SHALL consider
          them as 'good frames' for the purpose of counting in the
          smonVlanIdStats and smonPrioStats tables."

        " Port Copy provides the ability to copy all frames from a
         specified source to specified destination within a switch.
         Source and destinations MUST be ifEntries, as defined by [<a href="#ref-22" title='" The Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2"'>22</a>].
         One to one, one to many, many to one and many to many source to
         destination relationships may be configured.

         Applicable counters on the destination will increment for all
         packets transiting the port, be it by normal bridging/switching
         or due to packet copy.
         Note that this table manages no RMON data collection by itself,
         and an agent may possibly implement no RMON objects except
         objects related to the port copy operation defined by the
         portCopyCompliance conformance macro. That allows for a switch
         with no other embedded RMON capability to perform port copy
         operations to a destination port at which a different external
         RMON probe is connected.

         One to one, many to one and one to many source to destination
         relationships may be configured.

         Each row that exists in this table defines such a
         relationship. By disabling a row in this table the port copy
         relationship no longer exists.

         The number of entries and the types of port copies (1-1,
         many-1, 1-many) are implementation specific and could
         possibly be dynamic due to changing resource availability.

         In order to configure a source to destination portCopy
         relationship, both source and destination interfaces MUST be
         present as an ifEntry in the ifTable and their respective
         ifAdminStatus and ifOperStatus values MUST be equal to
         'up(1)'. If the value of any of those two objects changes
         after the portCopyEntry is activated, portCopyStatus will
         transition to 'notReady(3)'.

         The capability of an interface to be source or destination of
         a port copy operation is described by the 'copySourcePort(0)'
         and 'copyDestPort(1)' bits in dataSourceCopyCaps. Those bits
         SHOULD be appropriately set by the agent, in order to allow
         for a portCopyEntry to be created.

         Applicable counters on the destination will increment for all

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.



<span class="grey">Waterman, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 41]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2613.html">RFC 2613</a>                        SMON MIB                       June 1999</span>


   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information. These are:

       smonCapabilities
       dataSourceCapsTable
       portCopyTable

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model <a href="rfc2574.html">RFC 2574</a> [<a href="#ref-12" title='"User-based Security Model for Version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>12</a>] and the View-based
   Access Control Model <a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a> [<a href="#ref-15" title='"View-based Access Control Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>15</a>] is RECOMMENDED.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
