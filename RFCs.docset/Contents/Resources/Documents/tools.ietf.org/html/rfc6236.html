Abstract

   This document proposes a new generic session setup attribute to make
   it possible to negotiate different image attributes such as image
   size.  A possible use case is to make it possible for a low-end hand-
   held terminal to display video without the need to rescale the image,
   something that may consume large amounts of memory and processing
   power.  The document also helps to maintain an optimal bitrate for
   video as only the image size that is desired by the receiver is
   transmitted.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document proposes a new SDP attribute to make it possible to
   negotiate different image attributes, such as image size.  The term
   image size is defined here, as it may differ from the physical screen
   size of, for instance, a hand-held terminal.  As an example, it may
   be beneficial to display a video image on a part of the physical
   screen and leave space on the screen for other features such as menus
   and other info.

   Allowing negotiation of the image size provides a number of benefits:

   o  Less image distortion: Rescaling of images introduces additional
      distortion, something that can be avoided (at least on the
      receiver side) if the image size can be negotiated.

   o  Reduced receiver complexity: Image rescaling can be quite
      computation intensive.  For low-end devices, this can be a
      problem.

   o  Optimal quality for the given bitrate: The sender does not need to
      encode an entire CIF (352x288) image if only an image size of
      288x256 is displayed on the receiver screen.

   o  Memory requirement: The receiver device will know the size of the
      image and can then allocate memory accordingly.

   o  Optimal aspect ratio: The indication of the supported image sizes
      and aspect ratio allows the receiver to select the most
      appropriate combination based on its rescaling capabilities and
      the desired rendering.  For example, if a sender proposes three
      resolutions in its SDP offer (100x200, 200x100, and 100x100) with
      sar=1.0 (1:1) etc., then the receiver can select the option that
      fits the receiver screen best.

   In cases where rescaling is not implemented (for example, rescaling
   is not mandatory to implement in H.264 [<a href="#ref-H.264" title='"Advanced video coding for generic audiovisual services"'>H.264</a>]), the indication of
   the image attributes may still provide an optimal use of bandwidth
   because the attribute will give the encoder a better indication about
   what image size is preferred anyway and will thus help to avoid
   wasting bandwidth by encoding with an unnecessarily large resolution.

   For implementers that are considering rescaling issues, it is worth
   noting that there are several benefits to doing it on the sender
   side:

   o  Rescaling on the sender/encoder side is likely to be easier to do
      as the camera-related software/hardware already contains the

      necessary functionality for zooming/cropping/trimming/sharpening
      the video signal.  Moreover, rescaling is generally done in RGB or
      YUV domains and should not depend on the codecs used.

   o  The encoder may be able to encode in a number of formats but may
      not know which format to choose as, without the image attribute,
      it does not know the receiver's performance or preference.

   o  The quality drop due to digital domain rescaling using
      interpolation is likely to be lower if it is done before the video
      encoding rather than after the decoding especially when low
      bitrate video coding is used.

   o  If low-complexity rescaling operations such as simple cropping
      must be performed, the benefit with having this functionality on
      the sender side is that it is then possible to present a miniature
      "what you send" image on the display to help the user to frame the
      image correctly.

   Several of the existing standards ([<a href="#ref-H.263" title='"Video coding for low bit rate communication"'>H.263</a>], [<a href="#ref-H.264" title='"Advanced video coding for generic audiovisual services"'>H.264</a>], and [<a href="#ref-MPEG-4" title='"Information technology - Coding of audio-visual objects - Part 2: Visual"'>MPEG-4</a>])
   have support for different resolutions at different framerates.  The
   purpose of this document is to provide for a generic mechanism, which
   is targeted mainly at the negotiation of the image size.  However, to
   make it more general, the attribute is named 'imageattr'.

   This document is limited to point-to-point unicast communication
   scenarios.  The attribute may be used in centralized conferencing
   scenarios as well but due to the abundance of configuration options,
   it may then be difficult to come up with a configuration that fits
   all parties.

   The design of the image attribute is based on the following
   requirements, which are listed only for informational purposes:

   REQ-1:  Support the indication of one or more set(s) of image
      attributes that the SDP endpoint wishes to receive or send.  Each
      image attribute set must include a specific image size.

   REQ-2:  Support setup/negotiation of image attributes, meaning that
      each side in the Offer/Answer should be able to negotiate the
      image attributes it prefers to send and receive.

   REQ-3:  Interoperate with codec-specific parameters such as sprop-
      parameter-sets in [<a href="#ref-H.264" title='"Advanced video coding for generic audiovisual services"'>H.264</a>] or config in [<a href="#ref-MPEG-4" title='"Information technology - Coding of audio-visual objects - Part 2: Visual"'>MPEG-4</a>].

   REQ-4:  Make the attribute generic with as few codec specific
      details/tricks as possible in order to be codec agnostic.

   Besides the above mentioned requirements, the requirement below may

   This section defines the SDP image attribute 'imageattr', which can
   be used in an SDP Offer/Answer exchange to indicate various image
   attribute parameters.  In this document, we define the following
   image attribute parameters: image resolution, sample aspect ratio
   (sar), allowed range in picture aspect ratio (par) and the preference
   of a given parameter set over another (q).  The attribute is
   extensible and guidelines for defining additional parameters are
   provided in <a href="#section-3.2.10">Section 3.2.10</a>.

   In this section, the syntax of the 'imageattr' attribute is
   described.  The 'imageattr' attribute is a media-level attribute.
   The section is split up in two parts: the first gives an overall view
   of the syntax, and the second describes how the syntax is used.

   The following rules apply for the parameters.

   Payload type number (PT):  The image attribute is bound to a specific
      codec by means of the payload type number.  A wild card (*) can be
      specified for the payload type number to indicate that it applies
      to all payload types in the media description.  Several image
      attributes can be defined, for instance for different video codec
      alternatives.  This however requires that the payload type numbers
      differ.  Note that the attribute is associated to the codec(s),
      for instance an SDP offer may specify payload type number 101
      while the answer may specify 102, this may make it troublesome to

      specify a payload type number with the 'imageattr' attribute.  See
      <a href="#section-3.2.2">Section 3.2.2</a> for a discussion and recommendation how this is
      solved.

   Preference (q):  The preference for each set is 0.5 by default;
      setting the optional q parameter to another value makes it
      possible to set different preferences for the sets.  A higher
      value gives a higher preference for the given set.

   sar:  The sar (storage aspect ratio) parameter specifies the sample
      aspect ratio associated to the given range of x and y values.  The
      sar parameter is defined as dx/dy where dx and dy are the physical
      size of the pixels.  Square pixels gives a sar=1.0.  The parameter
      sar MAY be expressed as a range or as a single value.

      If this parameter is not present, a default sar value of 1.0 is
      assumed.

      The interpretation of sar differs between the send and the receive
      directions.

      *  In the send direction, sar defines a specific sample aspect
         ratio associated to a given x and y image size (range).

      *  In the recv direction, sar expresses that the receiver of the
         given medium prefers to receive a given x and y resolution with
         a given sample aspect ratio.

      See <a href="#section-3.2.5">Section 3.2.5</a> for a more detailed discussion.

      The sar parameter will likely not solve all the issues that are
      related to different sample aspect ratios, but it can help to
      solve them and reduce aspect ratio distortion.

      The response MUST NOT include a sar parameter if there is no
      acceptable value given.  The reason for this is that if the
      response includes a sar parameter it is interpreted as "sar
      parameter accepted", while removal of the sar parameter is treated
      as "sar parameter not accepted".  For this reason, it is safer to
      remove an unacceptable sar parameter altogether.

   par:  The par (width/height = x/y ratio) parameter indicates a range
      of allowed ratios between x and y physical size (picture aspect
      ratio).  This is used to limit the number of x and y image size
      combinations; par is given as

       par=[ratio_min-ratio_max]

   where ratio_min and ratio_max are the min and max allowed picture
   aspect ratios.

   If sar and the sample aspect ratio that the receiver actually uses in
   the display are the same (or close), the relation between the x and y
   pixel resolution and the physical size of the image is
   straightforward.  If however sar differs from the sample aspect ratio
   of the receiver display, this must be taken into consideration when
   the x and y pixel resolution alternatives are sorted out.  See
   <a href="#section-4.2.4">Section 4.2.4</a> for an example of this.

   In accordance with [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>], offer/answer exchange of the image
   attribute is as follows.

   o  Offerer sending the offer:

      *  The offerer must be able to support the image attributes that
         it offers, unless the offerer has expressed a wild card (*) in
         the attribute list.

      *  It is recommended that a device that sees no reason to use the
         image attribute includes the attribute with wild cards (*) in
         the attribute lists anyway for the send and recv directions.
         An example of this looks like:

          a=imageattr:97 send * recv *

   This gives the answerer the possibility of expressing its
   preferences.  The use of wild cards introduces a risk that the
   message size can increase in an uncontrolled way.  To reduce this
   risk, these wild cards SHOULD only be replaced by an as small set as
   possible.

   o  Answerer receiving the offer and sending the answer:

      *  The answerer may choose to keep the image attribute but is not
         required to do so.

      *  The answerer may, for its receive and send direction, include
         one or more entries that it can support from the set of entries
         proposed in the offer.

      *  The answerer may also, for its receive and send direction,
         replace the entries with a complete new set of entries
         different from the original proposed by the offerer.  The

         implementor of this feature should however be aware that this
         may cause extra offer/answer exchanges.

      *  The answerer may also remove its send direction completely if
         it is deemed that it cannot support any of the proposed
         entries.

      *  The answerer should not include an image attribute in the
         answer if it was not present in the offer.

   o  Offerer receiving the answer:

      *  If the image attribute is not included in the SDP answer the
         offerer SHOULD continue to process the answer as if this
         mechanism had not been offered.

      *  If the image attribute is included in the SDP answer but none
         of the entries are usable or acceptable, the offerer MUST
         resort to other methods to determine the appropriate image
         size.  In this case, the offerer must also issue a new offer/
         answer without the image attribute to avoid misunderstandings
         between the offerer and answerer.  This will avoid the risk of
         infinite negotiations.

   When the initial offer does not contain the 'imageattr' attribute,
   the rules in <a href="#section-3.1.1.2">Section 3.1.1.2</a> require the attribute to be absent in
   the answer.  The reasons for this are:

   o  The offerer of the initial SDP is not likely to understand the
      image attribute if it did not include it in the offer, bearing in
      mind that <a href="#section-3.1.1">Section 3.1.1</a> recommends that the offerer provide the
      attribute with wild carded parameters if it has no preference.

   o  Inclusion of the image attribute in the answer may come in
      conflict with the rules in <a href="#section-3.1.1.2">Section 3.1.1.2</a>, especially the rules
      that apply to "offerer receiving the answer".

   For the above reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that a device that sees no
   reason to use the image attribute includes the attribute with wild
   cards (*) in the attribute lists anyway for the send and recv
   directions.

   If the image attribute in the offer specifies payload type number 99,
   this attribute will then have no meaning in the answerers receive
   direction as the m-line specifies media payload type number 100.

   There are a few ways to solve this.

   1.  Use a wild card "*" as the payload type number in the image
       attribute in the offer SDP.  The answer SDP also uses the wild
       card.  The drawback with this approach is that this attribute
       then applies to all payload type numbers in the media
       description.

   2.  Specify a wild card "*" as the payload type number in the image
       attribute in the answer SDP.  The offer SDP may contain a defined
       payload type number in the image attribute but the answer SDP
       replaces this with a wild card.  The drawback here is similar to
       what is listed above.

   3.  The image attribute is split in two parts in the SDP answer.  For
       example the offer SDP (only the parts of interest in this
       discussion) looks like:

           m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 99
           a=imageattr:99 send ... recv ...

   The answer SDP looks like:

           m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 100
           a=imageattr:99 send ...
           a=imageattr:100 recv ...

   This alternative does not pose any drawbacks.  Moreover, it allows
   specification of different image attributes if more than one payload
   type is specified in the offer SDP.

   Of the alternatives listed above, the last one MUST be used as it is
   the most safe.  The other alternatives MUST NOT be used.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.3.%20%20Asymmetry"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.3" name="section-3.2.3">3.2.3</a>.  Asymmetry</span>

   While the image attribute supports asymmetry, there are some
   limitations.  One important limitation is that the codec being used
   can only support up to a given maximum resolution for a given profile
   level.

   As an example, H.264 [<a href="#ref-H.264" title='"Advanced video coding for generic audiovisual services"'>H.264</a>] with profile level 1.2 does not support
   higher resolution than 352x288 (CIF).  The offer/answer rules imply
   that the same profile level must be used in both directions.  This
   means that in an asymmetric scenario where Alice wants an image size
   of 580x360 and Bob wants 150x120, profile level 2.2 is needed in both
   directions even though profile level 1 would have been sufficient in
   one direction.

   Currently, the only solution to this problem is to specify two
   unidirectional media descriptions.  Note however that the asymmetry
   issue for the H.264 codec is solved by means of the level-asymmetry-
   allowed parameter in [<a href="rfc6184.html" title='"RTP Payload Format for H.264 Video"'>RFC6184</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.4.%20%20sendonly%20and%20recvonly"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2.4" name="section-3.2.4">3.2.4</a>.  sendonly and recvonly</span>

   If the directional attributes a=sendonly or a=recvonly are given for
   a medium, there is of course no need to specify the image attribute
   for both directions.  Therefore, one of the directions in the
   attribute may be omitted.  However, it may be good to do the image
   attribute negotiation in both directions in case the session is
   updated for media in both directions at a later stage.

   The relationship between the sar parameter and the x and y pixel
   resolution deserves some extra discussion.  Consider the offer from
   Alice to Bob (we set the recv direction aside for the moment):

       a=imageattr:97 send [x=720,y=576,sar=1.1]

   If the receiver display has square pixels, the 720x576 image would
   need to be rescaled to for example 792x576 or 720x524 to ensure a
   correct image aspect ratio.  This in practice means that rescaling
   would need to be performed on the receiver side, something that is
   contrary to the spirit of this document.

   To avoid this problem Alice may specify a range of values for the sar
   parameter like:

       a=imageattr:97 send [x=720,y=576,sar=[0.91,1.0,1.09,1.45]]

   Meaning that Alice can encode with any of the mentioned sample aspect
   ratios, leaving Bob to decide which one he prefers.

   The image attribute can be used within the SDP Capability Negotiation
   [<a href="rfc5939.html" title='"Session Description Protocol (SDP) Capability Negotiation"'>RFC5939</a>] framework and its use is then specified using the "a=acap"
   parameter.  An example is

       a=acap:1 imageattr:97 send [x=720,y=576,sar=[0.91,1.0,1.09,1.45]]

   For use with SDP Media Capability Negotiation extension
   [<a href="#ref-SDPMedCapNeg" title='"SDP Media Mapabilities Negotiation"'>SDPMedCapNeg</a>], where it is no longer possible to specify payload
   type numbers, it is possible to use the parameter substitution rule,
   an example of this is

      ...
      a=mcap:1 video H264/90000
      a=acap:1 imageattr:%1% send [x=720,y=576,sar=[0.91,1.0,1.09,1.45]]
      ...

   where %1% maps to media capability number 1.

   It is also possible to use the a=mscap attribute like in the example
   below.

       ...
       a=mcap:1 video H264/90000
       a=mscap:1 imageattr send [x=720,y=576,sar=[0.91,1.0,1.09,1.45]]

   As the SDP for most codecs already specifies some kind of indication
   of, for example, the image size, at session setup, measures must be
   taken to avoid conflicts between the image attribute and this already
   existing information.

   The following subsections describe the most well known codecs and how
   they define image-size related information.  <a href="#section-3.2.7.4">Section 3.2.7.4</a> outlines
   a few possible solutions, but this document does not make a
   recommendation for any of them.

   H.263 defines (on the fmtp line) a list of image sizes and their
   maximum frame rates (profiles) that the offerer can receive.  The
   answerer is not allowed to modify this list and must reject a payload
   type that contains an unsupported profile.  The CUSTOM profile may be
   used for image size negotiation but support for asymmetry requires
   the specification of two unidirectional media descriptions using the
   sendonly/recvonly attributes.

   The payload format for H.264 [<a href="#ref-H.264" title='"Advanced video coding for generic audiovisual services"'>H.264</a>] is described in [<a href="rfc6184.html" title='"RTP Payload Format for H.264 Video"'>RFC6184</a>].

   H.264 defines information related to image size in the fmtp line by
   means of sprop-parameter-sets.  According to the specification,
   several sprop-parameter-sets may be defined for one payload type.
   The sprop-parameter-sets describe the image size (+ more) that the
   offerer sends in the stream and need not be complete.  This means
   that sprop-parameter-sets does not represent any negotiation and the
   answer is not allowed to change the sprop-parameter-sets.

   This configuration may be changed later inband if for instance image
   sizes need to be changed or added.

   MPEG-4 defines a config parameter on the fmtp line, which is a

   and the answer is not allowed to change the parameter.

   It is not possible to change the configuration using inband

   The subsections above clearly indicate that this kind of information

   There are a number of possible solutions, listed below without any
   preference:






<span class="grey">Johansson &amp; Jung             Standards Track                   [Page 14]</span></pre>

   o  Ignore payload format parameters: This may not work well in the
      presence of bad channel conditions especially in the beginning of
      a session.  Moreover, this is not a good option for MPEG-4.

   o  Second session-wide offer/answer round: In the second offer/
      answer, the parameters specific to codec payload format are
      defined based on the outcome of the 'imageattr' negotiation.  The
      drawback with this is that setup of the entire session (including
      audio) may be delayed considerably, especially as the 'imageattr'
      negotiation can already itself cost up to two offer/answer rounds.
      Also, the conflict between the 'imageattr' negotiation and the
      parameters specific to payload format is still present after the
      first offer/answer round and a fuzzy/buggy implementation may
      start media before the second offer/answer is completed with
      unwanted results.

   o  Second session-wide offer/answer round only for video: This is
      similar to the alternative above with the exception that setup
      time for audio is not increased; moreover, the port number for
      video is set to 0 during the first offer answer round to avoid the
      flow of media.

      This has the effect that video will blend in some time after the
      audio is started (up to 2 seconds delay).  This alternative is
      likely the most clean-cut and failsafe.  The drawback is, as the
      port number in the first offer is always zero, the media startup
      will always be delayed even though it would in fact have been
      possible to start media after the first offer/answer round.

      Note that according to [<a href="rfc3264.html" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC3264</a>], a port number of zero means that
      the whole media line is rejected, meaning that a new offer for the
      same port number should be treated as a completely new stream and
      not as an update.  The safest way to solve this problem is to use
      preconditions; this is however outside the scope of this document.

   A very likely scenario is that a user switches to another phone
   during a video telephony call or plugs a cellphone into an external
   monitor.  In both cases, it is very likely that a renegotiation is
   initiated using the SIP-REFER [<a href="rfc3515.html" title='"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Refer Method"'>RFC3515</a>] or SIP-UPDATE [<a href="rfc3311.html" title='"The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) UPDATE Method"'>RFC3311</a>]
   methods.  It is RECOMMENDED to negotiate the image size during this
   renegotiation.

   As the image attribute is a media-level attribute, its use with
   layered codecs causes some concern.  If the layers are transported in
   different RTP streams, the layers are specified on different media
   descriptions, and the relation is specified using the grouping
   framework [<a href="rfc5888.html" title='"The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework"'>RFC5888</a>] and the depend attribute [<a href="rfc5583.html" title='"Signaling Media Decoding Dependency in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)"'>RFC5583</a>].  As it is not
   possible to specify only one image attribute for several media
   descriptions the solution is either to specify the same image
   attribute for each media description, or to only specify the image
   attribute for the base layer.

   The image attribute allows for the addition of parameters in the
   future.  To make backwards adaptation possible, an entity that
   processes the attribute MUST ignore any unknown parameters in the
   offer and MUST NOT include them in the answer it generates.  Addition
   of future parameters that are not understood by the receiving
   endpoint may lead to ambiguities if mutual dependencies between
   parameters exist; therefore, addition of parameters must be done with
   great care.

   Assume that Alice wishes to set up a session with Bob and that Alice
   takes the first initiative.  The syntactical white-space delimiters
   (1*WSP) and double-quotes are removed to make reading easier.

   In the offer, Alice provides information for both the send and
   receive (recv) directions.  For the send direction, Alice provides a
   list that the answerer can select from.  For the receive direction,
   Alice may either specify a desired image size range right away or a *
   to instruct Bob to reply with a list of image sizes that Bob can
   support for sending.  Using the overall high level syntax the image
   attribute may then look like

       a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv attr-list

   or

       a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv *

   In the first alternative, the recv direction may be a full list of
   desired image size formats.  It may however (and most likely) just be
   a list with one alternative for the preferred x and y resolution.

   If Bob supports an x and y resolution in at least one of the X and Y
   ranges given in the send attr-list and in the recv attr-list of the
   offer, the answer from Bob will look like:

       a=imageattr:PT send attr-list recv attr-list

   and the offer/answer negotiation is done.  Note that the attr-list
   will likely be pruned in the answer.  While it may contain many
   different alternatives in the offer, it may in the end contain just
   one or two alternatives.

   If Bob does not support any x and y resolution in one of the provided
   send or recv ranges given in the send attr-list or in the recv attr-
   list, the corresponding part is removed completely.  For instance, if
   Bob doesn't support any of the offered alternatives in the recv attr-
   list in the offer, the answer from Bob would look like:

       a=imageattr:PT recv attr-list

   This section gives a few detailed examples.  It is assumed where
   needed that Alice initiates a session with Bob.

   Two image resolution alternatives are offered with 800x640 with

   It is also indicated that Alice wishes to display video with a
   resolution of 330x250 on her display.

    a=imageattr:97 send [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1,q=0.6] [x=480,y=320] \
                   recv [x=330,y=250]

   In case Bob accepts the "recv [x=330,y=250]", the answer may look
   like

    a=imageattr:97 recv [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \
                   send [x=330,y=250]

   indicating that the receiver (Bob) wishes the encoder (on Alice's
   side) to compensate for a sample aspect ratio of 1.1 (11:10) and
   desires an image size on its screen of 800x640.

   There is however a possibility that "recv [x=330,y=250]" is not
   supported.  If the case, Bob may completely remove this part or
   replace it with a list of supported image sizes.

    a=imageattr:97 recv [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \
                   send [x=[320:16:640],y=[240:16:480],par=[1.2-1.3]]

   Alice can then select a valid image size that is closest to the one
   that was originally desired (336x256) and performs a second offer/
   answer.

    a=imageattr:97 send [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \
                   recv [x=336,y=256]

   Bob replies with:

    a=imageattr:97 recv [x=800,y=640,sar=1.1] \

   Two image resolution sets are offered with the first having a higher

    a=imageattr:97 \
      send [x=[480:16:800],y=[320:16:640],par=[1.2-1.3],q=0.6] \
           [x=[176:8:208],y=[144:8:176],par=[1.2-1.3]] \
      recv *

   The x-axis resolution can take the values 480 to 800 in 16 pixels
   steps and 176 to 208 in 8 pixels steps.  The par parameter limits the
   set of possible x and y screen resolution combinations such that
   800x640 (ratio=1.25) is a valid combination while 720x608
   (ratio=1.18) or 800x608 (ratio=1.31) are invalid combinations.

   For the recv direction (Bob-&gt;Alice), Bob is requested to provide a
   list of supported image sizes.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.3.%20%20Example%203"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.3" name="section-4.2.3">4.2.3</a>.  Example 3</span>

   In this example, more of the SDP offer is shown.  A complicating
   factor is that the answerer changes the media payload type number in
   the offer/answer exchange.

    m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 99
    a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000
    a=fmtp:99 packetization-mode=0;profile-level-id=42e011; \
      sprop-parameter-sets=Z0LgC5ZUCg/I,aM4BrFSAa
    a=imageattr:99 \
      send [x=176,y=144] [x=224,y=176] [x=272,y=224] [x=320,y=240] \
      recv [x=176,y=144] [x=224,y=176] [x=272,y=224,q=0.6] [x=320,y=240]

   In the send direction, sprop-parameter-sets is defined for a
   resolution of 320x240, which is the largest image size offered in the
   send direction.  This means that if 320x240 is selected, no
   additional offer/answer is necessary.  In the receive direction, four
   alternative image sizes are offered with 272x224 being the preferred
   choice.

   The answer may look like:

    m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 100
    a=rtpmap:100 H264/90000
    a=fmtp:100 packetization-mode=0;profile-level-id=42e011; \
      sprop-parameter-sets=Z0LgC5ZUCg/I,aM4BrFSAa
    a=imageattr:99 send [x=320,y=240]
    a=imageattr:100 recv [x=320,y=240]

   indicating (in this example) that the image size is 320x240 in both
   directions.  Although the offerer preferred 272x224 for the receive
   direction, the answerer might not be able to offer 272x224 or not
   allow encoding and decoding of video of different image sizes
   simultaneously.  The answerer sets new sprop-parameter-sets,
   constructed for both send and receive directions at the restricted
   conditions and image size of 320x240.

   Note also that, because the payload type number is changed by the
   answerer, the image attribute is also split in two parts according to
   the recommendation in <a href="#section-3.2.2">Section 3.2.2</a>.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.4.%20%20Example%204"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.4" name="section-4.2.4">4.2.4</a>.  Example 4</span>

   This example illustrates in more detail how compensation for
   different sample aspect ratios can be negotiated with the image
   attribute.

   We set up a session between Alice and Bob; Alice is the offerer of
   the session.  The offer (from Alice) contains the image attribute
   below:

     a=imageattr:97 \
       send [x=400:16:800],y=[320:16:640],sar=[1.0-1.3],par=[1.2-1.3]] \
       recv [x=800,y=600,sar=1.1]

   First we consider the recv direction: The offerer (Alice) explicitly
   states that she wishes to receive the screen resolution 800x600.
   However, she also indicates that the screen on her display does not
   use square pixels; the sar value=1.1 means that Bob must (preferably)
   compensate for this.

   So, if Bob's video camera produces square pixels, and if Bob wishes
   to satisfy Alice's sar requirement, the image processing algorithm
   must rescale a 880x600 pixel image (880=800*1.1) to 800x600 pixels
   (could be done other ways).

   ... and now the send direction: Alice indicates that she can (in the
   image processing algorithms) rescale the image for sample aspect
   ratios in the range 1.0 to 1.3.  She can also provide a number of
   different image sizes (in pixels) ranging from 400x320 to 800x640.
   Bob inspects the offered sar and image sizes and responds with the
   modified image attribute.

    a=imageattr:97 \
      recv [x=464,y=384,sar=1.15] \
      send [x=800,y=600,sar=1.1]

   Alice will (in order to satisfy Bob's request) need to rescale the
   image from her video camera from 534x384 (534=464*1.15) to 464x384.

   Following the guidelines in [<a href="rfc4566.html" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>RFC4566</a>], the IANA is requested to
   register one new SDP attribute:

   Attribute name:     imageattr

   Long form name:     Image attribute

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6236.html">RFC 6236</a>                 Image Attributes in SDP                May 2011</span>


   Type of attribute:  Media-level

   Subject to charset: No

   Purpose:            This attribute defines the ability to negotiate
                       various image attributes such as image sizes.
                       The attribute contains a number of parameters
                       which can be modified in an offer/answer
                       exchange.

   Appropriate values: See <a href="rfc6236.html#section-3.1.1">Section 3.1.1 of RFC 6236</a>

   Contact name:       Authors of <a href="rfc6236.html">RFC 6236</a>

   The image attribute and especially the parameters that denote the
   image size can take on values that may cause memory or CPU exhaustion
   problems.  This may happen either as a consequence of a mistake by
   the sender of the SDP or as a result of an attack issued by a
   malicious SDP sender.  This issue is similar to the case where the
   a=fmtp line(s) may take on extreme values for the same reasons
   outlined above.

   A receiver of the SDP containing the image attribute MUST ensure that
   the parameters have values that are reasonable and that the device
   can handle the implications in terms of memory and CPU usage.
   Failure to do a sanity check on the parameters may result in memory
   or CPU exhaustion.

   In principle, for some SDPs containing the image attribute and for
   some deployments, it could be the case that simply checking the
   parameters is not sufficient to detect all potential Denial-of-
   Service (DoS) problems.  Implementers ought to consider whether there
   are any potential DoS attacks that would not be detected by simply
   checking parameters.
