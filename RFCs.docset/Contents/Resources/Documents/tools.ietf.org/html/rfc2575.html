   The Architecture for describing Internet Management Frameworks
   [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>] describes that an SNMP engine is composed of:

     1) a Dispatcher
     2) a Message Processing Subsystem,
     3) a Security Subsystem, and
     4) an Access Control Subsystem.

   Applications make use of the services of these subsystems.

   It is important to understand the SNMP architecture and its
   terminology to understand where the View-based Access Control Model
   described in this document fits into the architecture and interacts
   with other subsystems within the architecture.  The reader is
   expected to have read and understood the description and terminology
   of the SNMP architecture, as defined in [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>].

   The Access Control Subsystem of an SNMP engine has the responsibility
   for checking whether a specific type of access (read, write, notify)
   to a particular object (instance) is allowed.

   It is the purpose of this document to define a specific model of the
   Access Control Subsystem, designated the View-based Access Control
   Model. Note that this is not necessarily the only Access Control
   Model.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].





<span class="grey">Wijnen, et al.              Standards Track                     [Page 2]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a>                     VACM for SNMP                    April 1999</span>


<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.2.%20%20Access%20Control"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.2" name="section-1.2">1.2</a>.  Access Control</span>

   Access Control occurs (either implicitly or explicitly) in an SNMP
   entity when processing SNMP retrieval or modification request
   messages from an SNMP entity.  For example a Command Responder
   application applies Access Control when processing requests that it
   received from a Command Generator application.  These requests
   contain Read Class and Write Class PDUs as defined in [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>].

   Access Control also occurs in an SNMP entity when an SNMP
   notification message is generated (by a Notification Originator
   application).  These notification messages contain Notification Class
   PDUs as defined in [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>].

   The View-based Access Control Model defines a set of services that an
   application (such as a Command Responder or a Notification Originator
   application) can use for checking access rights.  It is the
   responsibility of the application to make the proper service calls
   for access checking.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.3.%20%20Local%20Configuration%20Datastore"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" name="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Local Configuration Datastore</span>

   To implement the model described in this document, an SNMP entity
   needs to retain information about access rights and policies.  This
   information is part of the SNMP engine's Local Configuration
   Datastore (LCD). See [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>] for the definition of LCD.

   In order to allow an SNMP entity's LCD to be remotely configured,
   portions of the LCD need to be accessible as managed objects.  A MIB
   module, the View-based Access Control Model Configuration MIB, which
   defines these managed object types is included in this document.

   This section contains definitions to realize the access control
   service provided by the View-based Access Control Model.

   A group is a set of zero or more &lt;securityModel, securityName&gt; tuples
   on whose behalf SNMP management objects can be accessed.  A group
   defines the access rights afforded to all securityNames which belong
   to that group. The combination of a securityModel and a securityName
   maps to at most one group.  A group is identified by a groupName.

   The Access Control module assumes that the securityName has already
   been authenticated as needed and provides no further authentication
   of its own.

   The View-based Access Control Model uses the securityModel and the
   securityName as inputs to the Access Control module when called to
   check for access rights.  It determines the groupName as a function
   of securityModel and securityName.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20securityLevel"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  securityLevel</span>

   Different access rights for members of a group can be defined for
   different levels of security, i.e., noAuthNoPriv, authNoPriv, and
   authPriv. The securityLevel identifies the level of security that
   will be assumed when checking for access rights.  See the SNMP
   Architecture document [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>] for a definition of securityLevel.

   The View-based Access Control Model requires that the securityLevel
   is passed as input to the Access Control module when called to check
   for access rights.

   An SNMP context is a collection of management information accessible
   by an SNMP entity.  An item of management information may exist in
   more than one context.  An SNMP entity potentially has access to many
   contexts.  Details about the naming of management information can be
   found in the SNMP Architecture document [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>].

   The View-based Access Control Model defines a vacmContextTable that
   lists the locally available contexts by contextName.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.%20%20MIB%20Views%20and%20View%20Families"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4" name="section-2.4">2.4</a>.  MIB Views and View Families</span>

   For security reasons, it is often valuable to be able to restrict the
   access rights of some groups to only a subset of the management
   information in the management domain.  To provide this capability,
   access to a context is via a "MIB view" which details a specific set
   of managed object types (and optionally, the specific instances of
   object types) within that context.  For example, for a given context,
   there will typically always be one MIB view which provides access to
   all management information in that context, and often there will be
   other MIB views each of which contains some subset of the
   information.  So, the access allowed for a group can be restricted in
   the desired manner by specifying its rights in terms of the
   particular (subset) MIB view it can access within each appropriate
   context.

   Since managed object types (and their instances) are identified via
   the tree-like naming structure of ISO's OBJECT IDENTIFIERs [ISO-
   ASN.1, <a href="rfc2578.html">RFC2578</a>],  it is convenient to define a MIB view as the
   combination of a set of "view subtrees", where each view subtree is a

   subtree within the managed object naming tree.  Thus, a simple MIB
   view (e.g., all managed objects within the Internet Network
   Management Framework) can be defined as a single view subtree, while
   more complicated MIB views (e.g., all information relevant to a
   particular network interface) can be represented by the union of
   multiple view subtrees.

   While any set of managed objects can be described by the union of
   some number of view subtrees, situations can arise that would require
   a very large number of view subtrees.  This could happen, for
   example, when specifying all columns in one conceptual row of a MIB
   table because they would appear in separate subtrees, one per column,
   each with a very similar format.  Because the formats are similar,
   the required set of subtrees can easily be aggregated into one
   structure.  This structure is named a family of view subtrees after
   the set of subtrees that it conceptually represents.  A family of
   view subtrees can either be included or excluded from a MIB view.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.1.%20%20View%20Subtree"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4.1" name="section-2.4.1">2.4.1</a>.  View Subtree</span>

   A view subtree is the set of all MIB object instances which have a
   common ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER prefix to their names.  A view subtree
   is identified by the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value which is the longest
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER prefix common to all (potential) MIB object
   instances in that subtree.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.4.2.%20%20ViewTreeFamily"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.4.2" name="section-2.4.2">2.4.2</a>.  ViewTreeFamily</span>

   A family of view subtrees is a pairing of an OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
   (called the family name) together with a bit string value (called the
   family mask).  The family mask indicates which sub-identifiers of the
   associated family name are significant to the family's definition.

   For each possible managed object instance, that instance belongs to a
   particular ViewTreeFamily if both of the following conditions are
   true:

   - the OBJECT IDENTIFIER name of the managed object instance
     contains at least as many sub-identifiers as does the family name,
     and

   - each sub-identifier in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER name of the managed
     object instance matches the corresponding sub-identifier of the
     family name whenever the corresponding bit of the associated family
     mask is non-zero.

   When the configured value of the family mask is all ones, the view
   subtree family is identical to the single view subtree identified by
   the family name.

   When the configured value of the family mask is shorter than required
   to perform the above test, its value is implicitly extended with
   ones.  Consequently, a view subtree family having a family mask of
   zero length always corresponds to a single view subtree.

   The View-based Access Control Model determines the access rights of a
   group, representing zero or more securityNames which have the same
   access rights.  For a particular context, identified by contextName,
   to which a group, identified by groupName, has access using a
   particular securityModel and securityLevel, that group's access
   rights are given by a read-view, a write-view and a notify-view.

   The read-view represents the set of object instances authorized for
   the group when reading objects.  Reading objects occurs when
   processing a retrieval operation (when handling Read Class PDUs).

   The write-view represents the set of object instances authorized for
   the group when writing objects.  Writing objects occurs when
   processing a write operation (when handling Write Class PDUs).

   The notify-view represents the set of object instances authorized for
   the group when sending objects in a notification, such as when
   sending a notification (when sending Notification Class PDUs).

   module that implements the View-based Access Control Model when

   The abstract data elements are:

     statusInformation - one of the following:
        accessAllowed  - a MIB view was found and access is granted.
        notInView      - a MIB view was found but access is denied.

                         the relevant entry in the vacmAccessTable).
        noSuchView     - no MIB view found because no view has been

                         vacmContextTable for specified contextName.
        noGroupName    - no MIB view found because no entry has been
                         configured in the vacmSecurityToGroupTable
                         for the specified combination of
                         securityModel and securityName.
        noAccessEntry  - no MIB view found because no entry has been
                         configured in the vacmAccessTable for the
                         specified combination of contextName,
                         groupName (from vacmSecurityToGroupTable),
                         securityModel and securityLevel.
        otherError     - failure, an undefined error occurred.
     securityModel - Security Model under which access is requested.
     securityName  - the principal on whose behalf access is requested.
     securityLevel - Level of Security under which access is requested.
     viewType      - view to be checked (read, write or notify).
     contextName   - context in which access is requested.
     variableName  - object instance to which access is requested.

 How the decision for isAccessAllowed is made.

 1) Inputs to the isAccessAllowed service are:

    (a)       securityModel    -- Security Model in use
    (b)       securityName     -- principal who wants to access
    (c)       securityLevel    -- Level of Security

    (f)       variableName     -- OID for the managed object
                               -- this is made up of:

                                  - object-instance (n)

 2) The partial "who" (1), represented by the securityModel (a) and
    the securityName (b), are used as the indices (a,b) into the
    vacmSecurityToGroupTable to find a single entry that produces a
    group, represented by groupName (x).

 3) The "where" (2), represented by the contextName (e), the "who",
    represented by the groupName (x) from the previous step, and the
    "how" (3), represented by securityModel (a) and securityLevel (c),
    are used as indices (e,x,a,c) into the vacmAccessTable to find a
    single entry that contains three MIB views.

 4) The "why" (4), represented by the viewType (d), is used to select
    the proper MIB view, represented by a viewName (y), from the
    vacmAccessEntry selected in the previous step. This viewName (y) is
    an index into the vacmViewTreeFamilyTable and selects the set of
    entries that define the variableNames which are included in or
    excluded from the MIB view identified by the viewName (y).

 5) The "what" (5) type of management data and "which" (6) particular
    instance, represented by the variableName (f), is then checked to be
    in the MIB view or not, e.g., the yes/no decision (z).

   This section describes the procedure followed by an Access Control
   module that implements the View-based Access Control Model whenever
   it receives an isAccessAllowed request.

   1) The vacmContextTable is consulted for information about
      the SNMP context identified by the contextName.  If information
      about this SNMP context is absent from the table, then an
      errorIndication (noSuchContext) is returned to the calling module.

   2) The vacmSecurityToGroupTable is consulted for mapping the
      securityModel and securityName to a groupName.  If the information
      about this combination is absent from the table, then an
      errorIndication (noGroupName) is returned to the calling module.

   3) The vacmAccessTable is consulted for information about the
      groupName, contextName, securityModel and securityLevel.  If
      information about this combination is absent from the table, then
      an errorIndication (noAccessEntry) is returned to the calling
      module.

   4) a) If the viewType is "read", then the read view is used for
         checking access rights.

      b) If the viewType is "write", then the write view is used for
         checking access rights.

      c) If the viewType is "notify", then the notify view is used
         for checking access rights.

      If the view to be used is the empty view (zero length viewName)
      then an errorIndication (noSuchView) is returned to the calling
      module.

   5) a) If there is no view configured for the specified viewType,
         then an errorIndication (noSuchView) is returned to the calling
         module.

      b) If the specified variableName (object instance) is not in the
         MIB view (see DESCRIPTION clause for vacmViewTreeFamilyTable in
         <a href="#section-4">section 4</a>), then an errorIndication (notInView) is returned to

         Otherwise,

      c) The specified variableName is in the MIB view.
         A statusInformation of success (accessAllowed) is returned to
         the calling module.

vacmContextTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX       SEQUENCE OF VacmContextEntry
    MAX-ACCESS   not-accessible
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION "The table of locally available contexts.

                 This table provides information to SNMP Command
                 Generator applications so that they can properly
                 configure the vacmAccessTable to control access to
                 all contexts at the SNMP entity.

                 This table may change dynamically if the SNMP entity
                 allows that contexts are added/deleted dynamically
                 (for instance when its configuration changes). Such
                 changes would happen only if the management
                 instrumentation at that SNMP entity recognizes more
                 (or fewer) contexts.

                 The presence of entries in this table and of entries
                 in the vacmAccessTable are independent.  That is, a
                 context identified by an entry in this table is not
                 necessarily referenced by any entries in the
                 vacmAccessTable; and the context(s) referenced by an
                 entry in the vacmAccessTable does not necessarily
                 currently exist and thus need not be identified by an
                 entry in this table.

                 This table must be made accessible via the default
                 context so that Command Responder applications have
                 a standard way of retrieving the information.

                 This table is read-only. It cannot be configured via
                 SNMP.

    SYNTAX       SEQUENCE OF VacmAccessEntry
    MAX-ACCESS   not-accessible
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION "The table of access rights for groups.

                 Each entry is indexed by a groupName, a contextPrefix,
                 a securityModel and a securityLevel.  To determine
                 whether access is allowed, one entry from this table
                 needs to be selected and the proper viewName from that
                 entry must be used for access control checking.

                 To select the proper entry, follow these steps:

                 1) the set of possible matches is formed by the
                    intersection of the following sets of entries:
                      the set of entries with identical vacmGroupName
                      the union of these two sets:
                       - the set with identical vacmAccessContextPrefix
                       - the set of entries with vacmAccessContextMatch
                         value of 'prefix' and matching

                         value of 'any'
                      intersected with the set of entries with
                      vacmAccessSecurityLevel value less than or equal
                      to the requested securityLevel

                 2) if this set has only one member, we're done
                    otherwise, it comes down to deciding how to weight
                    the preferences between ContextPrefixes,
                    SecurityModels, and SecurityLevels as follows:
                    a) if the subset of entries with securityModel
                       matching the securityModel in the message is
                       not empty, then discard the rest.
                    b) if the subset of entries with
                       vacmAccessContextPrefix matching the contextName
                       in the message is not empty,
                       then discard the rest
                    c) discard all entries with ContextPrefixes shorter
                       than the longest one remaining in the set
                    d) select the entry with the highest securityLevel

                 Please note that for securityLevel noAuthNoPriv, all
                 groups are really equivalent since the assumption that
                 the securityName has been authenticated does not hold.

                 use of the Set operation in creating or modifying
                 views.

                 When creating a new view or altering an existing
                 view, it is important to understand the potential
                 interactions with other uses of the view.  The

                 the view to be created should be determined to be
                 unique by the SNMP Command Generator application by
                 consulting the vacmViewTreeFamilyTable.  Finally,
                 the named view may be created (Set), including the
                 advisory lock.
                 If another SNMP Command Generator application has
                 altered the views in the meantime, then the spin
                 lock's value will have changed, and so this creation
                 will fail because it will specify the wrong value for
                 the spin lock.

                 Since this is an advisory lock, the use of this lock
                 is not enforced.

vacmViewTreeFamilyTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX       SEQUENCE OF VacmViewTreeFamilyEntry
    MAX-ACCESS   not-accessible
    STATUS       current
    DESCRIPTION "Locally held information about families of subtrees
                 within MIB views.

                 Each MIB view is defined by two sets of view subtrees:
                   - the included view subtrees, and
                   - the excluded view subtrees.
                 Every such view subtree, both the included and the
                 excluded ones, is defined in this table.

                 To determine if a particular object instance is in
                 a particular MIB view, compare the object instance's
                 OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each of the MIB view's active
                 entries in this table.  If none match, then the
                 object instance is not in the MIB view.  If one or
                 more match, then the object instance is included in,
                 or excluded from, the MIB view according to the
                 value of vacmViewTreeFamilyType in the entry whose
                 value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree has the most
                 sub-identifiers.  If multiple entries match and have
                 the same number of sub-identifiers (when wildcarding
                 is specified with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask),
                 then the lexicographically greatest instance of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilyType determines the inclusion or
                 exclusion.

                 An object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X matches an
                 active entry in this table when the number of
                 sub-identifiers in X is at least as many as in the
                 value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree for the entry,
                 and each sub-identifier in the value of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree matches its corresponding
                 sub-identifier in X.  Two sub-identifiers match
                 either if the corresponding bit of the value of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilyMask for the entry is zero (the
                 'wild card' value), or if they are equal.

                 A 'family' of subtrees is the set of subtrees defined
                 by a particular combination of values of
                 vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask.
                 In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in the
                 vacmViewTreeFamilyMask, the family of subtrees reduces
                 to a single subtree.

                 DESCRIPTION clause of vacmViewSpinLock.

                 first the 'excluded' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are
                 created and then the 'included' entries.

                 When deleting MIB views, it is strongly advised that
                 first the 'included' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are
                 deleted and then the 'excluded' entries.

                 support instance-level granularity, then an

   This document is meant for use in the SNMP architecture.  The View-
   based Access Control Model described in this document checks access
   rights to management information based on:

   - contextName, representing a set of management information at the
     managed system where the Access Control module is running.
   - groupName, representing a set of zero or more securityNames.
     The combination of a securityModel and a securityName is mapped
     into a group in the View-based Access Control Model.
   - securityModel under which access is requested.
   - securityLevel under which access is requested.
   - operation performed on the management information.
   - MIB views for read, write or notify access.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc2575.html">RFC 2575</a>                     VACM for SNMP                    April 1999</span>


   When the User-based Access Control module is called for checking
   access rights, it is assumed that the calling module has ensured the
   authentication and privacy aspects as specified by the securityLevel
   that is being passed.

   When creating entries in or deleting entries from the
   vacmViewTreeFamilyTable it is important to do such in the sequence as
   recommended in the DESCRIPTION clause of the vacmViewTreeFamilyTable
   definition. Otherwise unwanted access may be granted while changing
   the entries in the table.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.2.%20%20Defining%20Groups"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.2" name="section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Defining Groups</span>

   The groupNames are used to give access to a group of zero or more
   securityNames.  Within the View-Based Access Control Model, a
   groupName is considered to exist if that groupName is listed in the
   vacmSecurityToGroupTable.

   By mapping the combination of a securityModel and securityName into a
   groupName, an SNMP Command Generator application can add/delete
   securityNames to/from a group, if proper access is allowed.

   Further it is important to realize that the grouping of
   &lt;securityModel, securityName&gt; tuples in the vacmSecurityToGroupTable
   does not take securityLevel into account. It is therefore important
   that the security administrator uses the securityLevel index in the
   vacmAccessTable to separate noAuthNoPriv from authPriv and/or
   authNoPriv access.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.3.%20%20Conformance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.3" name="section-7.3">7.3</a>.  Conformance</span>

   For an implementation of the View-based Access Control Model to be
   conformant, it MUST implement the SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB according
   to the vacmMIBCompliance.  It also SHOULD implement the initial
   configuration, described in <a href="#appendix-A">appendix A</a>.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.4.%20%20Access%20to%20the%20SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7.4" name="section-7.4">7.4</a>.  Access to the SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB</span>

   The objects in this MIB control the access to all MIB data that is
   accessible via the SNMP engine and they may be considered sensitive
   in many environments.  It is important to closely control (both read
   and write) access to these to these MIB objects by using
   appropriately configured Access Control models (for example the
   View-based Access Control Model as specified in this document).

APPENDIX A - Installation

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.1.%20%20Installation%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" name="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Installation Parameters</span>

   During installation, an authoritative SNMP engine which supports this
   View-based Access Control Model SHOULD be configured with several
   initial parameters.  These include for the View-based Access Control
   Model:

1) A security configuration

   The choice of security configuration determines if initial
   configuration is implemented and if so how.  One of three possible
   choices is selected:

        - initial-minimum-security-configuration
        - initial-semi-security-configuration
        - initial-no-access-configuration

   In the case of a initial-no-access-configuration, there is no initial
   configuration, and so the following steps are irrelevant.

2) A default context

   One entry in the vacmContextTable with a contextName of "" (the empty
   string), representing the default context.  Note that this table gets
   created automatically if a default context exists.

     vacmContextName                  ""

3) An initial group

   One entry in the vacmSecurityToGroupTable to allow access to group
   "initial".

     vacmSecurityModel                3 (USM)
     vacmSecurityName                 "initial"
     vacmGroupName                    "initial"
     vacmSecurityToGroupStorageType   anyValidStorageType
     vacmSecurityToGroupStatus        active

4) Initial access rights

   Three entries in the vacmAccessTable as follows:

   - read-notify access for securityModel USM, securityLevel
     "noAuthNoPriv" on behalf of securityNames that belong to the group
     "initial" to the &lt;restricted&gt; MIB view in the default context with
     contextName "".

   - read-write-notify access for securityModel USM, securityLevel
     "authNoPriv" on behalf of securityNames that belong to the group
     "initial" to the &lt;internet&gt; MIB view in the default context with
     contextName "".

   - if privacy is supported,
     read-write-notify access for securityModel USM, securityLevel
     "authPriv" on behalf of securityNames that belong to the group
     "initial" to the &lt;internet&gt; MIB view in the default context with
     contextName "".

   That translates into the following entries in the vacmAccessTable.

   - One entry to be used for unauthenticated access (noAuthNoPriv):

     vacmGroupName                    "initial"
     vacmAccessContextPrefix          ""
     vacmAccessSecurityModel          3 (USM)
     vacmAccessSecurityLevel          noAuthNoPriv
     vacmAccessContextMatch           exact
     vacmAccessReadViewName           "restricted"
     vacmAccessWriteViewName          ""
     vacmAccessNotifyViewName         "restricted"
     vacmAccessStorageType            anyValidStorageType
     vacmAccessStatus                 active

   - One entry to be used for authenticated access (authNoPriv)
     with optional privacy (authPriv):

     vacmGroupName                    "initial"
     vacmAccessContextPrefix          ""
     vacmAccessSecurityModel          3 (USM)
     vacmAccessSecurityLevel          authNoPriv
     vacmAccessContextMatch           exact
     vacmAccessReadViewName           "internet"
     vacmAccessWriteViewName          "internet"
     vacmAccessNotifyViewName         "internet"
     vacmAccessStorageType            anyValidStorageType
     vacmAccessStatus                 active

5) Two MIB views, of which the second one depends on the security
   configuration.

   -  One view, the &lt;internet&gt; view, for authenticated access:

      -  the &lt;internet&gt; MIB view is the following subtree:
             "internet"  (subtree 1.3.6.1)

   -  A second view, the &lt;restricted&gt; view, for unauthenticated
      access.  This view is configured according to the selected
      security configuration:

      -  For the initial-no-access-configuration there is no default
         initial configuration, so no MIB views are pre-scribed.

      -  For the initial-semi-secure-configuration:

         the &lt;restricted&gt; MIB view is the union of these subtrees:
         (a) "system"       (subtree 1.3.6.1.2.1.1)      [<a href="rfc1907.html">RFC1907</a>]
         (b) "snmp"         (subtree 1.3.6.1.2.1.11)     [<a href="rfc1907.html">RFC1907</a>]
         (c) "snmpEngine"   (subtree 1.3.6.1.6.3.10.2.1) [<a href="rfc2571.html" title='"An Architecture for describing SNMP Management Frameworks"'>RFC2571</a>]
         (d) "snmpMPDStats" (subtree 1.3.6.1.6.3.11.2.1) [<a href="rfc2572.html" title='"Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)"'>RFC2572</a>]
         (e) "usmStats"     (subtree 1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.1) [<a href="rfc2574.html" title='"User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)"'>RFC2574</a>]

      -  For the initial-minimum-secure-configuration:

         the &lt;restricted&gt; MIB view is the following subtree.
             "internet"  (subtree 1.3.6.1)

   This translates into the following "internet" entry in the
   vacmViewTreeFamilyTable:

                                minimum-secure      semi-secure
                                ----------------    ---------------

  vacmViewTreeFamilyMask        ""                  ""
  vacmViewTreeFamilyType        1 (included)        1 (included)
  vacmViewTreeFamilyStorageType anyValidStorageType anyValidStorageType
  vacmViewTreeFamilyStatus      active              active
