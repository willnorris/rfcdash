Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document standardizes five new media types -- text/xml,
   application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity, application/xml-
   external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd -- for use in
   exchanging network entities that are related to the Extensible Markup
   Language (XML).  This document also standardizes a convention (using
   the suffix '+xml') for naming media types outside of these five types
   when those media types represent XML MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions) entities.  XML MIME entities are currently exchanged via
   the HyperText Transfer Protocol on the World Wide Web, are an
   integral part of the WebDAV protocol for remote web authoring, and
   are expected to have utility in many domains.

   Major differences from <a href="rfc2376.html">RFC 2376</a> are (1) the addition of text/xml-
   external-parsed-entity, application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and
   application/xml-dtd, (2) the '+xml' suffix convention (which also
   updates the <a href="rfc2048.html">RFC 2048</a> registration process), and (3) the discussion of
   "utf-16le" and "utf-16be".

   The World Wide Web Consortium has issued Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)[<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"'>XML</a>].  To enable the exchange of XML
   network entities, this document standardizes five new media types --
   text/xml, application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity,
   application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd -- as
   well as a naming convention for identifying XML-based MIME media
   types.

   XML entities are currently exchanged on the World Wide Web, and XML
   is also used for property values and parameter marshalling by the
   WebDAV[RFC2518] protocol for remote web authoring.  Thus, there is a
   need for a media type to properly label the exchange of XML network
   entities.

   Although XML is a subset of the Standard Generalized Markup Language
   (SGML) ISO 8879[SGML], which has been assigned the media types
   text/sgml and application/sgml, there are several reasons why use of
   text/sgml or application/sgml to label XML is inappropriate.  First,
   there exist many applications that can process XML, but that cannot
   process SGML, due to SGML's larger feature set.  Second, SGML
   applications cannot always process XML entities, because XML uses
   features of recent technical corrigenda to SGML.  Third, the
   definition of text/sgml and application/sgml in [<a href="rfc1874.html" title='"SGML Media Types"'>RFC1874</a>] includes
   parameters for SGML bit combination transformation format (SGML-
   bctf), and SGML boot attribute (SGML-boot).  Since XML does not use
   these parameters, it would be ambiguous if such parameters were given
   for an XML MIME entity.  For these reasons, the best approach for
   labeling XML network entities is to provide new media types for XML.

   Since XML is an integral part of the WebDAV Distributed Authoring
   Protocol, and since World Wide Web Consortium Recommendations have
   conventionally been assigned IETF tree media types, and since similar
   media types (HTML, SGML) have been assigned IETF tree media types,
   the XML media types also belong in the IETF media types tree.

   Similarly, XML will be used as a foundation for other media types,
   including types in every branch of the IETF media types tree.  To
   facilitate the processing of such types, media types based on XML,
   but that are not identified using text/xml or application/xml, SHOULD
   be named using a suffix of '+xml' as described in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.  This
   will allow XML-based tools -- browsers, editors, search engines, and
   other processors -- to work with all XML-based media types.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20Notational%20Conventions"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>. Notational Conventions</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   As defined in [<a href="rfc2781.html" title='"UTF-16, an encoding of ISO 10646"'>RFC2781</a>], the three charsets "utf-16", "utf-16le", and
   "utf-16be" are used to label UTF-16 text.  In this document, "the
   UTF-16 family" refers to those three charsets.  By contrast, the
   phrases "utf-16" or UTF-16 in this document refer specifically to the
   single charset "utf-16".

   As sometimes happens between two communities, both MIME and XML have
   defined the term entity, with different meanings.  <a href="rfc2045.html#section-2.4">Section 2.4 of
   [RFC2045]</a> says:

      "The term 'entity' refers specifically to the MIME-defined header
      fields and contents of either a message or one of the parts in the
      body of a multipart entity."

   Section 4 of [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"'>XML</a>] says:

      "An XML document may consist of one or many storage units" called
      entities that "have content" and are normally "identified by
      name".

   In this document, "XML MIME entity" is defined as the latter (an XML
   entity) encapsulated in the former (a MIME entity).

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20XML%20Media%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>. XML Media Types</span>

   This document standardizes five media types related to XML MIME
   entities: text/xml, application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity,
   application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd.
   Registration information for these media types is described in the
   sections below.

   Within the XML specification, XML MIME entities can be classified
   into four types.  In the XML terminology, they are called "document
   entities", "external DTD subsets", "external parsed entities", and
   "external parameter entities".  The media types text/xml and
   application/xml MAY be used for "document entities", while text/xml-
   external-parsed-entity or application/xml-external-parsed-entity
   SHOULD be used for "external parsed entities".  The media type
   application/xml-dtd SHOULD be used for "external DTD subsets" or
   "external parameter entities".  application/xml and text/xml MUST NOT
   be used for "external parameter entities" or "external DTD subsets",
   and MUST NOT be used for "external parsed entities" unless they are
   also well-formed "document entities" and are referenced as such.
   Note that [<a href="rfc2376.html" title='"XML Media Types"'>RFC2376</a>] (which this document obsoletes) allowed such
   usage, although in practice it is likely to have been rare.

   Neither external DTD subsets nor external parameter entities parse as
   XML documents, and while some XML document entities may be used as
   external parsed entities and vice versa, there are many cases where
   the two are not interchangeable.  XML also has unparsed entities,
   internal parsed entities, and internal parameter entities, but they
   are not XML MIME entities.

   If an XML document -- that is, the unprocessed, source XML document
   -- is readable by casual users, text/xml is preferable to
   application/xml.  MIME user agents (and web user agents) that do not
   have explicit support for text/xml will treat it as text/plain, for
   example, by displaying the XML MIME entity as plain text.
   Application/xml is preferable when the XML MIME entity is unreadable
   by casual users.  Similarly, text/xml-external-parsed-entity is

   preferable when an external parsed entity is readable by casual
   users, but application/xml-external-parsed-entity is preferable when
   a plain text display is inappropriate.

      NOTE: Users are in general not used to text containing tags such
      as &lt;price&gt;, and often find such tags quite disorienting or
      annoying.  If one is not sure, the conservative principle would
      suggest using application/* instead of text/* so as not to put
      information in front of users that they will quite likely not
      understand.

   The top-level media type "text" has some restrictions on MIME
   entities and they are described in [<a href="rfc2045.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies"'>RFC2045</a>] and [<a href="rfc2046.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>RFC2046</a>].  In
   particular, the UTF-16 family, UCS-4, and UTF-32 are not allowed
   (except over HTTP[RFC2616], which uses a MIME-like mechanism).  Thus,
   if an XML document or external parsed entity is encoded in such
   character encoding schemes, it cannot be labeled as text/xml or
   text/xml-external-parsed-entity (except for HTTP).

   Text/xml and application/xml behave differently when the charset
   parameter is not explicitly specified.  If the default charset (i.e.,
   US-ASCII) for text/xml is inconvenient for some reason (e.g., bad web
   servers), application/xml provides an alternative (see "Optional
   parameters" of application/xml registration in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>).  The
   same rules apply to the distinction between text/xml-external-
   parsed-entity and application/xml-external-parsed-entity.

   XML provides a general framework for defining sequences of structured
   data.  In some cases, it may be desirable to define new media types
   that use XML but define a specific application of XML, perhaps due to
   domain-specific security considerations or runtime information.
   Furthermore, such media types may allow UTF-8 or UTF-16 only and
   prohibit other charsets.  This document does not prohibit such media
   types and in fact expects them to proliferate.  However, developers
   of such media types are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use this document as
   a basis for their registration.  In particular, the charset parameter
   SHOULD be used in the same manner, as described in <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>, in
   order to enhance interoperability.

   An XML document labeled as text/xml or application/xml might contain
   namespace declarations, stylesheet-linking processing instructions
   (PIs), schema information, or other declarations that might be used
   to suggest how the document is to be processed.  For example, a
   document might have the XHTML namespace and a reference to a CSS
   stylesheet.  Such a document might be handled by applications that
   would use this information to dispatch the document for appropriate
   processing.

   MIME media type name: text

   MIME subtype name: xml

   Mandatory parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset

      Although listed as an optional parameter, the use of the charset
      parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, since this information can be
      used by XML processors to determine authoritatively the character
      encoding of the XML MIME entity.  The charset parameter can also
      be used to provide protocol-specific operations, such as charset-
      based content negotiation in HTTP.  "utf-8" [<a href="rfc2279.html" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>RFC2279</a>] is the
      recommended value, representing the UTF-8 charset.  UTF-8 is
      supported by all conforming processors of [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"'>XML</a>].

      If the XML MIME entity is transmitted via HTTP, which uses a
      MIME-like mechanism that is exempt from the restrictions on the
      text top-level type (see <a href="rfc2616.html#section-19.4.1">section 19.4.1 of [RFC2616]</a>), "utf-16"
      [<a href="rfc2781.html" title='"UTF-16, an encoding of ISO 10646"'>RFC2781</a>]) is also recommended.  UTF-16 is supported by all
      conforming processors of [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"'>XML</a>].  Since the handling of CR, LF and
      NUL for text types in most MIME applications would cause undesired
      transformations of individual octets in UTF-16 multi-octet
      characters, gateways from HTTP to these MIME applications MUST
      transform the XML MIME entity from text/xml; charset="utf-16" to
      application/xml; charset="utf-16".

      Conformant with [<a href="rfc2046.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types"'>RFC2046</a>], if a text/xml entity is received with
      the charset parameter omitted, MIME processors and XML processors
      MUST use the default charset value of "us-ascii"[<a href="#ref-ASCII" title='"US-ASCII. Coded Character Set -- 7-Bit American Standard Code for Information Interchange"'>ASCII</a>].  In cases
      where the XML MIME entity is transmitted via HTTP, the default
      charset value is still "us-ascii".  (Note: There is an
      inconsistency between this specification and HTTP/1.1, which uses
      ISO-8859-1[ISO8859] as the default for a historical reason.  Since
      XML is a new format, a new default should be chosen for better
      I18N.  US-ASCII was chosen, since it is the intersection of UTF-8
      and ISO-8859-1 and since it is already used by MIME.)

      There are several reasons that the charset parameter is
      authoritative.  First, some MIME processing engines do transcoding
      of MIME bodies of the top-level media type "text" without
      reference to any of the internal content.  Thus, it is possible
      that some agent might change text/xml; charset="iso-2022-jp" to
      text/xml; charset="utf-8" without modifying the encoding
      declaration of an XML document.  Second, text/xml must be



<span class="grey">Murata, et al.              Standards Track                     [Page 7]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc3023.html">RFC 3023</a>                    XML Media Types                 January 2001</span>


      compatible with text/plain, since MIME agents that do not
      understand text/xml will fallback to handling it as text/plain.
      If the charset parameter for text/xml were not authoritative, such
      fallback would cause data corruption.  Third, recent web servers
      have been improved so that users can specify the charset
      parameter.  Fourth, [<a href="rfc2130.html" title='"The Report of the IAB Character Set Workshop held 29 February - 1 March, 1996"'>RFC2130</a>] specifies that the recommended
      specification scheme is the "charset" parameter.

      Since the charset parameter is authoritative, the charset is not
      always declared within an XML encoding declaration.  Thus, special
      care is needed when the recipient strips the MIME header and
      provides persistent storage of the received XML MIME entity (e.g.,
      in a file system).  Unless the charset is UTF-8 or UTF-16, the
      recipient SHOULD also persistently store information about the
      charset, perhaps by embedding a correct XML encoding declaration
      within the XML MIME entity.

   Encoding considerations: This media type MAY be encoded as
      appropriate for the charset and the capabilities of the underlying
      MIME transport.  For 7-bit transports, data in UTF-8 MUST be
      encoded in quoted-printable or base64.  For 8-bit clean transport
      (e.g., 8BITMIME[RFC1652] ESMTP or NNTP[RFC0977]), UTF-8 does not
      need to be encoded.  Over HTTP[RFC2616], no content-transfer-
      encoding is necessary and UTF-16 may also be used.

   Security considerations: See <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

   Interoperability considerations: XML has proven to be interoperable
      across WebDAV clients and servers, and for import and export from
      multiple XML authoring tools.  For maximum interoperability,
      validating processors are recommended.  Although non-validating
      processors may be more efficient, they are not required to handle
      all features of XML.  For further information, see sub-<a href="#section-2.9">section 2.9</a>
      "Standalone Document Declaration" and <a href="#section-5">section 5</a> "Conformance" of
      [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"'>XML</a>].

   Published specification: Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second
      Edition)[<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"'>XML</a>].

   Applications which use this media type: XML is device-, platform-,
      and vendor-neutral and is supported by a wide range of Web user
      agents, WebDAV[RFC2518] clients and servers, as well as XML
      authoring tools.

      the XML MIME entity.  The charset parameter can also be used to
      provide protocol-specific operations, such as charset-based
      content negotiation in HTTP.

      "utf-8" [<a href="rfc2279.html" title='"UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646"'>RFC2279</a>] and "utf-16" [<a href="rfc2781.html" title='"UTF-16, an encoding of ISO 10646"'>RFC2781</a>] are the recommended
      values, representing the UTF-8 and UTF-16 charsets, respectively.
      These charsets are preferred since they are supported by all
      conforming processors of [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"'>XML</a>].

      If an application/xml entity is received where the charset
      parameter is omitted, no information is being provided about the
      charset by the MIME Content-Type header.  Conforming XML
      processors MUST follow the requirements in section 4.3.3 of [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"'>XML</a>]
      that directly address this contingency.  However, MIME processors
      that are not XML processors SHOULD NOT assume a default charset if
      the charset parameter is omitted from an application/xml entity.

      There are several reasons that the charset parameter is
      authoritative.  First, recent web servers have been improved so
      that users can specify the charset parameter.  Second, [<a href="rfc2130.html" title='"The Report of the IAB Character Set Workshop held 29 February - 1 March, 1996"'>RFC2130</a>]
      specifies that the recommended specification scheme is the
      "charset" parameter.

      On the other hand, it has been argued that the charset parameter
      should be omitted and the mechanism described in <a href="#appendix-F">Appendix F</a> of
      [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"'>XML</a>] (which is non-normative) should be solely relied on.  This
      approach would allow users to avoid configuration of the charset
      parameter; an XML document stored in a file is likely to contain a
      correct encoding declaration or BOM (if necessary), since the
      operating system does not typically provide charset information
      for files.  If users would like to rely on the encoding
      declaration or BOM and to hide charset information from protocols,
      they may determine not to use the parameter.

      Since the charset parameter is authoritative, the charset is not
      always declared within an XML encoding declaration.  Thus, special
      care is needed when the recipient strips the MIME header and
      provides persistent storage of the received XML MIME entity (e.g.,
      in a file system).  Unless the charset is UTF-8 or UTF-16, the
      recipient SHOULD also persistently store information about the
      charset, perhaps by embedding a correct XML encoding declaration
      within the XML MIME entity.

      appropriate for the charset and the capabilities of the underlying
      MIME transport.  For 7-bit transports, data in either UTF-8 or
      UTF-16 MUST be encoded in quoted-printable or base64.  For 8-bit

The Byte Order Mark (BOM) and Conversions to/from the UTF-16 Charset</span>

   Section 4.3.3 of [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"'>XML</a>] specifies that XML MIME entities in the
   charset "utf-16" MUST begin with a byte order mark (BOM), which is a
   hexadecimal octet sequence 0xFE 0xFF (or 0xFF 0xFE, depending on
   endian).  The XML Recommendation further states that the BOM is an
   encoding signature, and is not part of either the markup or the
   character data of the XML document.

   Due to the presence of the BOM, applications that convert XML from
   "utf-16" to a non-Unicode encoding MUST strip the BOM before
   conversion.  Similarly, when converting from another encoding into
   "utf-16", the BOM MUST be added after conversion is complete.

   In addition to the charset "utf-16", [<a href="rfc2781.html" title='"UTF-16, an encoding of ISO 10646"'>RFC2781</a>] introduces "utf-16le"
   (little endian) and "utf-16be" (big endian) as well.  The BOM is
   prohibited for these charsets.  When an XML MIME entity is encoded in
   "utf-16le" or "utf-16be", it MUST NOT begin with the BOM but SHOULD
   contain an encoding declaration.  Conversion from "utf-16" to "utf-
   16be" or "utf-16le" and conversion in the other direction MUST strip
   or add the BOM, respectively.

   embedding the base URI in XML MIME entities.  However, a Proposed

   define such a mechanism for text/xml, application/xml, text/xml-

   This document recommends the use of a naming convention (a suffix of
   '+xml') for identifying XML-based MIME media types, whatever their
   particular content may represent.  This allows the use of generic XML
   processors and technologies on a wide variety of different XML
   document types at a minimum cost, using existing frameworks for media
   type registration.

   Although the use of a suffix was not considered as part of the
   original MIME architecture, this choice is considered to provide the
   most functionality with the least potential for interoperability
   problems or lack of future extensibility.  The alternatives to the '
   +xml' suffix and the reason for its selection are described in
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

   As XML development continues, new XML document types are appearing
   rapidly.  Many of these XML document types would benefit from the
   identification possibilities of a more specific MIME media type than
   text/xml or application/xml can provide, and it is likely that many
   new media types for XML-based document types will be registered in
   the near and ongoing future.

   While the benefits of specific MIME types for particular types of XML
   documents are significant, all XML documents share common structures
   and syntax that make possible common processing.

   Some areas where 'generic' processing is useful include:

   o  Browsing - An XML browser can display any XML document with a
      provided [<a href="#ref-CSS" title='"Cascading Style Sheets, level 2 (CSS2) Specification"'>CSS</a>] or [<a href="#ref-XSLT" title='"XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0"'>XSLT</a>] style sheet, whatever the vocabulary of
      that document.

   o  Editing - Any XML editor can read, modify, and save any XML
      document.

   o  Fragment identification - XPointers (work in progress) can work
      with any XML document, whatever vocabulary it uses and whether or
      not it uses XPointer for its own fragment identification.

   o  Hypertext linking - XLink (work in progress) hypertext linking is
      designed to connect any XML documents, regardless of vocabulary.

   o  Searching - XML-oriented search engines, web crawlers, agents, and
      query tools should be able to read XML documents and extract the
      names and content of elements and attributes even if the tools are
      ignorant of the particular vocabulary used for elements and
      attributes.

   o  Storage - XML-oriented storage systems, which keep XML documents
      internally in a parsed form, should similarly be able to process,
      store, and recreate any XML document.

   o  Well-formedness and validity checking - An XML processor can
      confirm that any XML document is well-formed and that it is valid
      (i.e., conforms to its declared DTD or Schema).

   When a new media type is introduced for an XML-based format, the name
   of the media type SHOULD end with '+xml'.  This convention will allow
   applications that can process XML generically to detect that the MIME
   entity is supposed to be an XML document, verify this assumption by
   invoking some XML processor, and then process the XML document
   accordingly.  Applications may match for types that represent XML
   MIME entities by comparing the subtype to the pattern '*/*+xml'.  (Of
   course, 4 of the 5 media types defined in this document -- text/xml,
   application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity, and
   application/xml-external-parsed-entity -- also represent XML MIME
   entities while not conforming to the '*/*+xml' pattern.)

      NOTE: <a href="#section-14.1">Section 14.1</a> of HTTP[RFC2616] does not support Accept
      headers of the form "Accept: */*+xml" and so this header MUST NOT
      be used in this way.  Instead, content negotiation[RFC2703] could
      potentially be used if an XML-based MIME type were needed.

   XML generic processing is not always appropriate for XML-based media
   types.  For example, authors of some such media types may wish that
   the types remain entirely opaque except to applications that are
   specifically designed to deal with that media type.  By NOT following
   the naming convention '+xml', such media types can avoid XML-generic
   processing.  Since generic processing will be useful in many cases,
   however -- including in some situations that are difficult to predict
   ahead of time -- those registering media types SHOULD use the '+xml'
   convention unless they have a particularly compelling reason not to.

   The registration process for these media types is described in
   [<a href="rfc2048.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures"'>RFC2048</a>].  The registrar for the IETF tree will encourage new XML-
   based media type registrations in the IETF tree to follow this
   guideline.  Registrars for other trees SHOULD follow this convention

   in order to ensure maximum interoperability of their XML-based
   documents.  Similarly, media subtypes that do not represent XML MIME
   entities MUST NOT be allowed to register with a '+xml' suffix.

   Registrations for new XML-based media types under the top-level type
   "text" SHOULD, in specifying the charset parameter and encoding
   considerations, define them as: "Same as [charset parameter /
   encoding considerations] of text/xml as specified in <a href="rfc3023.html">RFC 3023</a>."

   Registrations for new XML-based media types under top-level types

   The use of the charset parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, since this
   information can be used by XML processors to determine
   authoritatively the charset of the XML MIME entity.

   These registrations SHOULD specify that the XML-based media type
   being registered has all of the security considerations described in

   type.

   The examples below give the value of the MIME Content-type header and
   the XML declaration (which includes the encoding declaration) inside
   the XML MIME entity.  For UTF-16 examples, the Byte Order Mark
   character is denoted as "{BOM}", and the XML declaration is assumed
   to come at the beginning of the XML MIME entity, immediately
   following the BOM.  Note that other MIME headers may be present, and
   the XML MIME entity may contain other data in addition to the XML
   declaration; the examples focus on the Content-type header and the
   encoding declaration for clarity.

   &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;

   This is the recommended charset value for use with text/xml.  Since
   the charset parameter is provided, MIME and XML processors MUST treat
   the enclosed entity as UTF-8 encoded.

   If sent using a 7-bit transport (e.g., SMTP[RFC0821]), the XML MIME
   entity MUST use a content-transfer-encoding of either quoted-
   printable or base64.  For an 8-bit clean transport (e.g., 8BITMIME
   ESMTP or NNTP), or a binary clean transport (e.g., HTTP), no
   content-transfer-encoding is necessary.

   or

   {BOM}&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;

   This is possible only when the XML MIME entity is transmitted via
   HTTP, which uses a MIME-like mechanism and is a binary-clean
   protocol, hence does not perform CR and LF transformations and allows
   NUL octets.  As described in [<a href="rfc2781.html" title='"UTF-16, an encoding of ISO 10646"'>RFC2781</a>], the UTF-16 family MUST NOT be
   used with media types under the top-level type "text" except over
   HTTP (see <a href="rfc2616.html#section-19.4.1">section 19.4.1 of [RFC2616]</a> for details).

   Since HTTP is binary clean, no content-transfer-encoding is
   necessary.

   Omitting the charset parameter is NOT RECOMMENDED for text/xml.  For

   XML, as a subset of SGML, has all of the same security considerations
   as specified in [<a href="rfc1874.html" title='"SGML Media Types"'>RFC1874</a>], and likely more, due to its expected
   ubiquitous deployment.

   To paraphrase <a href="rfc1874.html#section-3">section 3 of RFC 1874</a>, XML MIME entities contain
   information to be parsed and processed by the recipient's XML system.
   These entities may contain and such systems may permit explicit
   system level commands to be executed while processing the data.  To
   the extent that an XML system will execute arbitrary command strings,
   recipients of XML MIME entities may be a risk.  In general, it may be
   possible to specify commands that perform unauthorized file
   operations or make changes to the display processor's environment
   that affect subsequent operations.

   In general, any information stored outside of the direct control of
   the user -- including CSS style sheets, XSL transformations, entity
   declarations, and DTDs -- can be a source of insecurity, by either
   obvious or subtle means.  For example, a tiny "whiteout attack"
   modification made to a "master" style sheet could make words in
   critical locations disappear in user documents, without directly

   modifying the user document or the stylesheet it references.  Thus,
   the security of any XML document is vitally dependent on all of the
   documents recursively referenced by that document.

   The entity lists and DTDs for XHTML 1.0[XHTML], for instance, are
   likely to be a commonly used set of information.  Many developers
   will use and trust them, few of whom will know much about the level
   of security on the W3C's servers, or on any similarly trusted
   repository.

   The simplest attack involves adding declarations that break
   validation.  Adding extraneous declarations to a list of character
   entities can effectively "break the contract" used by documents.  A
   tiny change that produces a fatal error in a DTD could halt XML
   processing on a large scale.  Extraneous declarations are fairly
   obvious, but more sophisticated tricks, like changing attributes from
   being optional to required, can be difficult to track down.  Perhaps
   the most dangerous option available to crackers is redefining default
   values for attributes: e.g., if developers have relied on defaulted
   attributes for security, a relatively small change might expose
   enormous quantities of information.

   Apart from the structural possibilities, another option, "entity
   spoofing," can be used to insert text into documents, vandalizing and
   perhaps conveying an unintended message.  Because XML 1.0 permits
   multiple entity declarations, and the first declaration takes
   precedence, it's possible to insert malicious content where an entity
   is used, such as by inserting the full text of Winnie the Pooh in
   every occurrence of &amp;mdash;.

   Use of the digital signatures work currently underway by the xmldsig
   working group may eventually ameliorate the dangers of referencing
   external documents not under one's own control.

   Use of XML is expected to be varied, and widespread.  XML is under
   scrutiny by a wide range of communities for use as a common syntax
   for community-specific metadata.  For example, the Dublin
   Core[RFC2413] group is using XML for document metadata, and a new
   effort has begun that is considering use of XML for medical
   information.  Other groups view XML as a mechanism for marshalling
   parameters for remote procedure calls.  More uses of XML will
   undoubtedly arise.

   Security considerations will vary by domain of use.  For example, XML
   medical records will have much more stringent privacy and security
   considerations than XML library metadata.  Similarly, use of XML as a
   parameter marshalling syntax necessitates a case by case security
   review.

   XML may also have some of the same security concerns as plain text.
   Like plain text, XML can contain escape sequences that, when
   displayed, have the potential to change the display processor
   environment in ways that adversely affect subsequent operations.
   Possible effects include, but are not limited to, locking the
   keyboard, changing display parameters so subsequent displayed text is
   unreadable, or even changing display parameters to deliberately
   obscure or distort subsequent displayed material so that its meaning
   is lost or altered.  Display processors SHOULD either filter such
   material from displayed text or else make sure to reset all important
   settings after a given display operation is complete.

   Some terminal devices have keys whose output, when pressed, can be
   changed by sending the display processor a character sequence.  If
   this is possible the display of a text object containing such
   character sequences could reprogram keys to perform some illicit or
   dangerous action when the key is subsequently pressed by the user.
   In some cases not only can keys be programmed, they can be triggered
   remotely, making it possible for a text display operation to directly
   perform some unwanted action.  As such, the ability to program keys
   SHOULD be blocked either by filtering or by disabling the ability to
   program keys entirely.

   Note that it is also possible to construct XML documents that make
   use of what XML terms "entity references" (using the XML meaning of
   the term "entity" as described in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>), to construct repeated
   expansions of text.  Recursive expansions are prohibited by [<a href="#ref-XML" title='"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition)"'>XML</a>] and
   XML processors are required to detect them.  However, even non-
   recursive expansions may cause problems with the finite computing
   resources of computers, if they are performed many times.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Appendix%20A.%20Why%20Use%20the%20%27%2Bxml%27%20Suffix%20for%20XML-Based%20MIME%20Types%3F"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" name="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>. Why Use the '+xml' Suffix for XML-Based MIME Types?</span>

   Although the use of a suffix was not considered as part of the
   original MIME architecture, this choice is considered to provide the
   most functionality with the least potential for interoperability
   problems or lack of future extensibility.  The alternatives to the
   '+xml' suffix and the reason for its selection are described below.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.1%20Why%20not%20just%20use%20text%2Fxml%20or%20application%2Fxml%20and%20let%20the%20XML"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" name="appendix-A.1">A.1</a> Why not just use text/xml or application/xml and let the XML</span>
    processor dispatch to the correct application based on the
    referenced DTD?

   text/xml and application/xml remain useful in many situations,
   especially for document-oriented applications that involve combining
   XML with a stylesheet in order to present the data.  However, XML is
   also used to define entirely new data types, and an XML-based format
   such as image/svg+xml fits the definition of a MIME media type
   exactly as well as image/png[PNG] does.  (Note that image/svg+xml is
   not yet registered.) Although extra functionality is available for
   MIME processors that are also XML processors, XML-based media types
   -- even when treated as opaque, non-XML media types -- are just as
   useful as any other media type and should be treated as such.

   Since MIME dispatchers work off of the MIME type, use of text/xml or
   application/xml to label discrete media types will hinder correct
   dispatching and general interoperability.  Finally, many XML
   documents use neither DTDs nor namespaces, yet are perfectly legal
   XML.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.2%20Why%20not%20create%20a%20new%20subtree%20%28e.g.%2C%20image%2Fxml.svg%29%20to%20represent%20XML"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.2" name="appendix-A.2">A.2</a> Why not create a new subtree (e.g., image/xml.svg) to represent XML</span>
    MIME types?

   The subtree under which a media type is registered -- IETF, vendor
   (*/vnd.*), or personal (*/prs.*); see [<a href="rfc2048.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures"'>RFC2048</a>] for details -- is
   completely orthogonal from whether the media type uses XML syntax or
   not.  The suffix approach allows XML document types to be identified
   within any subtree.  The vendor subtree, for example, is likely to
   include a large number of XML-based document types.  By using a
   suffix, rather than setting up a separate subtree, those types may
   remain in the same location in the tree of MIME types that they would
   have occupied had they not been based on XML.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.3%20Why%20not%20create%20a%20new%20top-level%20MIME%20type%20for%20XML-based%20media%20types%3F"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.3" name="appendix-A.3">A.3</a> Why not create a new top-level MIME type for XML-based media types?</span>

   The top-level MIME type (e.g., model/*[<a href="rfc2077.html" title='"The Model Primary Content Type for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"'>RFC2077</a>]) determines what kind
   of content the type is, not what syntax it uses.  For example, agents
   using image/* to signal acceptance of any image format should
   certainly be given access to media type image/svg+xml, which is in

   all respects a standard image subtype.  It just happens to use XML to
   describe its syntax.  The two aspects of the media type are
   completely orthogonal.

   XML-based data types will most likely be registered in ALL top-level

   include application/mathml+xml[MathML] and image/svg+xml[SVG].

    determine whether it is XML?

   Rather than explicitly labeling XML-based media types, the processor
   could look inside each type and see whether or not it is XML.  The
   processor could also cache a list of XML-based media types.

   Although this method might work acceptably for some mail
   applications, it would fail completely in many other uses of MIME.
   For instance, an XML-based web crawler would have no way of
   determining whether a file is XML except to fetch it and check.  The
   same issue applies in some IMAP4[RFC2060] mail applications, where
   the client first fetches the MIME type as part of the message
   structure and then decides whether to fetch the MIME entity.
   Requiring these fetches just to determine whether the MIME type is
   XML could have significant bandwidth and latency disadvantages in
   many situations.

   Sniffing XML also isn't as simple as it might seem.  DOCTYPE
   declarations aren't required, and they can appear fairly deep into a
   document under certain unpreventable circumstances.  (E.g., the XML
   declaration, comments, and processing instructions can occupy space
   before the DOCTYPE declaration.) Even sniffing the DOCTYPE isn't
   completely reliable, thanks to a variety of issues involving default
   values for namespaces within external DTDs and overrides inside the
   internal DTD.  Finally, the variety in potential character encodings
   (something XML provides tools to deal with), also makes reliable
   sniffing less likely.

   always XML.  Parameters, as they have been defined in the MIME
   architecture, are never invariant across all instantiations of a
   media type.

   More practically, very few if any MIME dispatchers and other MIME
   agents support dispatching off of a parameter.  While MIME agents on
   the receiving side will need to be updated in either case to support
   (or fall back to) generic XML processing, it has been suggested that
   it is easier to implement this functionality when acting off of the
   media type rather than a parameter.  More important, sending agents
   require no update to properly tag an image as "image/svg+xml", but
   few if any sending agents currently support always tagging certain
   content types with a parameter.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.6%20How%20about%20labeling%20with%20parameters%20in%20the%20other%20direction%20%28e.g.%2C"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.6" name="appendix-A.6">A.6</a> How about labeling with parameters in the other direction (e.g.,</span>
    application/xml; Content-Feature=iotp)?

   This proposal fails under the simplest case, of a user with neither
   knowledge of XML nor an XML-capable MIME dispatcher.  In that case,
   the user's MIME dispatcher is likely to dispatch the content to an
   XML processing application when the correct default behavior should
   be to dispatch the content to the application responsible for the
   content type (e.g., an ecommerce engine for
   application/iotp+xml[RFC2801], once this media type is registered).

   Note that even if the user had already installed the appropriate
   application (e.g., the ecommerce engine), and that installation had
   updated the MIME registry, many operating system level MIME
   registries such as .mailcap in Unix and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT in Windows
   do not currently support dispatching off a parameter, and cannot
   easily be upgraded to do so.  And, even if the operating system were
   upgraded to support this, each MIME dispatcher would also separately
   need to be upgraded.

   This combines the problems of <a href="#appendix-A.5">Appendix A.5</a> and <a href="#appendix-A.6">Appendix A.6</a>.

   If the sender attaches an image/svg+xml file to a message and
   includes the instructions "Please copy the French text on the road
   sign", someone with an XML-aware MIME client and an XML browser but
   no support for SVG can still probably open the file and copy the
   text.  By contrast, with superclasses, the sender must add superclass
   support to her existing mailer AND the receiver must add superclass
   support to his before this transaction can work correctly.

   If the receiver comes to rely on the superclass tag being present and
   applications are deployed relying on that tag (as always seems to
   happen), then only upgraded senders will be able to interoperate with
   those receiving applications.

    or creating a new Content-Structure header to indicate XML syntax?

   This has nearly identical problems to <a href="#appendix-A.7">Appendix A.7</a>, in that it
   requires both senders and receivers to be upgraded, and few if any
   operating systems and MIME dispatchers support working off of
   anything other than the MIME type.

   This is better than <a href="#appendix-A.8">Appendix A.8</a>, in that no extra functionality
   needs to be added to a MIME registry to support dispatching of
   information other than standard content types.  However, it still
   requires both sender and receiver to be upgraded, and it will also
   fail in many cases (e.g., web hosting to an outsourced server), where
   the user can set MIME types (often through implicit mapping to file
   extensions), but has no way of adding arbitrary HTTP headers.

   When the conneg protocol is fully defined, this may potentially be a

   conneg[RFC2703] development, it is not a credible replacement for a
   MIME-based solution.

   MIME explicitly defines two levels of content type, the top-level for
   the kind of content and the second-level for the specific media type.
   [<a href="rfc2048.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures"'>RFC2048</a>] extends this in an interoperable way by using prefixes to
   specify separate trees for IETF, vendor, and personal registrations.
   This specification also extends the two-level type by using the '
   +xml' suffix.  In both cases, processors that are unaware of these
   later specifications treat them as opaque and continue to
   interoperate.  By contrast, adding a third-level type would break the
   current MIME architecture and cause numerous interoperability
   failures.

   As specified in <a href="rfc2045.html#section-5.1">Section 5.1 of [RFC2045]</a>, a tspecial can't be used:

      tspecials :=
      "(" / ")" / "&lt;" / "&gt;" / "@" /
      "," / ";" / ":" / "\" / &lt;"&gt;
      "/" / "[" / "]" / "?" / "="

   It was thought that "." would not be a good choice since it is
   already used as an additional hierarchy delimiter.  Also, "*" has a
   common wildcard meaning, and "-" and "_" are common word separators
   and easily confused.  The characters %'`#&amp; are frequently used for
   quoting or comments and so are not ideal.

   That leaves: ~!$^+{}|

   Note that "-" is used heavily in the current registry.  "$" and "_"
   are used once each.  The others are currently unused.

   It was thought that '+' expressed the semantics that a MIME type can
   be treated (for example) as both scalable vector graphics AND ALSO as
   XML; it is both simultaneously.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.13%20What%20is%20the%20semantic%20difference%20between%20application%2Ffoo%20and"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.13" name="appendix-A.13">A.13</a> What is the semantic difference between application/foo and</span>
     application/foo+xml?

   MIME processors that are unaware of XML will treat the '+xml' suffix
   as completely opaque, so it is essential that no extra semantics be
   assigned to its presence.  Therefore, application/foo and
   application/foo+xml SHOULD be treated as completely independent media
   types.  Although, for example, text/calendar+xml could be an XML
   version of text/calendar[RFC2445], it is possible that this
   (hypothetical) new media type would include new semantics as well as
   new syntax, and in any case, there would be many applications that
   support text/calendar but had not yet been upgraded to support
   text/calendar+xml.

   In the ten years that MIME has existed, XML is the first generic data
   format that has seemed to justify special treatment, so it is hoped
   that no further suffixes will be necessary.  However, if some are
   later defined, and these documents were also XML, they would need to
   specify that the '+xml' suffix is always the outermost suffix (e.g.,

   application/foo+ebml+xml not application/foo+xml+ebml).  If they were
   not XML, then they would use a regular suffix (e.g.,
   application/foo+ebml).

   You don't have to, but unless you have a good reason to explicitly
   disallow generic XML processing, you should use the suffix so as not
   to curtail the options of future users and developers.

   Whether the inventors of a media type, today, design it for dispatch
   to generic XML processing machinery (and most won't) is not the
   critical issue.  The core notion is that the knowledge that some
   media type happens to use XML syntax opens the door to unanticipated
   kinds of processing beyond those envisioned by its inventors, and on
   this basis identifying such encoding is a good and useful thing.

   Developers of new media types are often tightly focused on a
   particular type of processing that meets current needs.  But there is
   no need to rule out generic processing as well, which could make your
   media type more valuable over time.  It is believed that registering
   with the '+xml' suffix will cause no interoperability problems
   whatsoever, while it may enable significant new functionality and
   interoperability now and in the future.  So, the conservative
   approach is to include the '+xml' suffix.

   There are numerous and significant differences between this
   specification and [<a href="rfc2376.html" title='"XML Media Types"'>RFC2376</a>], which it obsoletes.  This appendix
   summarizes the major differences only.

   First, text/xml-external-parsed-entity and application/xml-external-
   parsed-entity are added as media types for external parsed entities,
   and text/xml and application/xml are now prohibited.

   Second, application/xml-dtd is added as a media type for external DTD
   subsets and external parameter entities, and text/xml and
   application/xml are now prohibited.

   Third, "utf-16le" and "utf-16be" are added.  <a href="rfc2781.html">RFC 2781</a> has introduced
   these BOM-less variations of the UTF-16 family.

   Fourth, a naming convention ('+xml') for XML-based media types has
   been added, which also updates [<a href="rfc2048.html" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures"'>RFC2048</a>] as described in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.
   By following this convention, an XML-based media type can be easily
   recognized as such.
