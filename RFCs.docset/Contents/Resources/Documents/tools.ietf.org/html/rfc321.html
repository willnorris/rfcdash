                    CBI Networking Activity at MITRE


     This RFC is in response to Tom O'Sullivan's probe for comments

on Computer Based Instruction. MITRE is currently doing some pre-

liminary work in the area,at the present time limited to use of CAI-

related network resources.

     The most expedient way for me to respond is by attaching excerpts

taken from a recent status report prepared for internal MITRE use,

intended for staff not generally familiar with the ARPANET. Comments

directed at specific items in Tom's attachment will follow in a future

RFC.

     We welcome comments on our activities and would like to partici-

pate in any CBI dialogs that take place.

                  ARPA NETWORK STUDIES AND EXPERIMENTS


<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-1.0" href="#section-1.0">1.0</a>  OBJECTIVES</span>

     MITRE/Washington became a node in the ARPA computer network in

September 1971 when a Terminal Interface Message Processor (TIP) was

installed. Since that time MITRE's use of the network has largely

been supported by IR&amp;D funds. The objectives of the IR&amp;D Network

Studies are:

     (a)  to promote the use of the network resources in an

          operational mode within MITRE to increase the computer

          capabilities available for supporting sponsor's work;

     (b)  to use the ARPANET itself as a research tool for

          conducting computer networking experiments; and

     (c)  to demonstrate the use of ARPANET resources to extend

          the capabilities of existing systems.

     Specifically, the proposed objectives are:

     (1)  to select ARPANET resources that can be used to support

          identified MITRE projects and to demonstrate how these

          resources can be used;

<span class="grey">2.0  APPROACH</span>

     The IR&amp;D Network Studies and Experiments project requires soft-

ware development on selected ARPANET Host computers and extensive

exercising of network resources. The approach taken to fulfill the

project objectives involves effort in three areas.

     Task area I is designed to build up ARPANET usage by MITRE.

Task II involves conducting data sharing experiments on the network

utilizing software being built by MITRE at several network sites.

Task III is intended to demonstrate the use of CAI-related network

resources to augment the TICCIT/CAI system.

     The specific activities involved in each task area are discussed

below.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
     That Are Possibly by Drawing on ARPANET Resources
     -------------------------------------------------

     The structure of the ARPANET is such that it is technically

possible to combine resources on the network to form a "distributed

system." A first step in this direction would be to use network

resources to augment a special-purpose system connected at one of the

nodes. The special-purpose system would serve as the vertex of the

distributed system, dynamically drawing on network resources to

perform specific functions.









<span class="grey">                                                                [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey">     The TICCIT/CAI system is a good candidate for demonstrating the</span>

feasibility of the concept of a distributed system. However, rather

than initially connecting TICCIT to the network, resources on the

network will first be used to demonstrate how they could augment the

capabilities of TICCIT

     Task III is organized as three subtasks to demonstrate that the

range of curriculum material can be extended, to demonstrate that the

TICCIT/CAI system can be supplemented with specialized CAI systems

that use AI techniques, and to demonstrate that TICCIT system resources

and capabilities can be augmented by using computing and storage

resources available on the network.

     (a)  Demonstrate that the range of curriculum
          material can be extended.

The range of curriculum material offered by the TICCIT/CAI system can

be extended by using network resources.  Two areas that were selected

for the demonstration are mathematics and computer science.

     The Culler-Fried On-Line Graphics-Oriented system available on

the IBM 360/75 at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB)

was selected for use in mathematics courses.  A collection of diverse

systems and languages will be selected to demonstrate how they can be

incorporated in a computer science curriculum.

     The following tasks are necessary for demonstrating that the

range of curriculum material can be extended:

     *  learn the use and structure of the Culler Fried system.

     *  use the Culler-Fried system over the network using an

     *  design sample courses for demonstration of the use of

        the Culler-Fried system in a mathematics curriculum.

     *  develop software to incorporate the use of the Culler-

        Fried system in the sample courses and demonstrate.

     *  prepare a sample computer science curriculum and demonstrate

        how the wide range of systems on the network can be utilized

        in a typical computer science curriculum.

     *  determine and document the technical specifications required

        for a TICCIT/CAI system interface.

     (b)  Demonstrate that the TICCIT/CAI system can be supplemented
          with specialized CAI systems that use AI techniques.

There are two network resources utilizing AI techniques that have been

applied to computer assisted instruction tasks: SCHOLAR and LOGO.

SCHOLAR is a mixed-initiative rather than a frame-oriented CAI system.

LOGO is a LISP-based programming language designed to study whether

notions and skills of formal reasoning and problem-solving can be

taught. We will investigate if these systems can be used to supple-

ment the TICCIT system and, if possible, will demonstrate their use.

     The following tasks are required:

     *  investigate the use of SCHOLAR on the TENEX system

        at BBN over the network.

     *  investigate the use of LOGO and the "turtle" over the

        network from the PDP-10 at MIT/AI and/or from TENEX at BBN.

     *  demonstrate the use of the systems over the network.

     (c)  Demonstrate that TICCIT system resources and capabilities
          can be augmented by using computing and storage resources
          available on the network.

It should be possible for the TICCIT/CAI system to substantially in-

crease its capacity by using large data storage devices on the ARPANET

for storing student records and curriculum and by using some Host

computer to run complex statistical analysis programs to analyze and

evaluate student progress and course content.

     In order to demonstrate that such a scheme is possible, the

following tasks are necessary:

     *  determine format and requirements for curriculum

        material and student records.

     *  develop a method to store and retrieve data on a

        demand basis.

     *  select a Host on the network and develop software

        for a demonstration.

     *  determine and document requirements for an interface

        with the TICCIT system.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
     That Are Possible by Drawing on ARPANET Resources
     -------------------------------------------------

     Many of the resources on the ARPANET were designed as stand

alone systems not intended for use over the network nor for facile

interfacing with other systems.  Thus we have found that more work

than initially was estimated is needed to use the selected CAI-related

systems over the network.  Therefore we plan to fulfill the goals of

each subtask by demonstrating the use of selected resources over the

network but will not attempt to interconnect the systems in any

fashion during FY1972.  A proposal to investigate the notion of a

distributed CAI system using ARPANET resources is under preparation.

     The status of our progress in using CAI-related resources over

the network is presented below.

     (a)  Demonstrate that the range of curriculum material
          can be extended.

The Culler-Fried (C-F) On-Line Graphics-Oriented system at UCSB was

selected to demonstrate its use in mathematics curriculum.  The system

has been used successfully in a variety of courses at UCSB, including

chemistry, mathematics, and economics(30,31,32,33,35).

     The Culler-Fried system's normal mode of operation is with two

keyboards and a Tektronics graphics display device. The keys on the

second keyboard are "function" keys; for example, by pressing a single

key the user can initiate complex actions such as displaying a plot

<span class="grey">of a convolution function(35). The system can also be used to provide</span>

online access to the 360/75 system to remotely control the execution

of programs. The latter service is currently available on the network

through TELNET. Access to the system was made possible by defining a

mapping from ASCII characters (sent as the "network virtual terminal")

to characters expected by the OLS. Thus it is often necessary to type

a sequence of characters on a TTY-type device to invoke the action of

a single function key. Under the current implementation, graphics

output to the network is suppressed.

     We plan to demonstrate the use of the C-F system on an IMLAC

graphics device attached to our TIP. During the first phase of our

implementation, we will not simulate the C-F function keyboard but

will enter our graphics input using the procedures defined for use

via TELNET. For output, UCSB agreed to provide a new output processor

which will no longer suppress graphics output, but will map it into

the remote graphics capabilities as provided by IMLAC (Figure 3).

Such a system was implemented in early February but due to the

character-oriented nature of the IMLAC device available to us, the

resolution was unsatisfactory. We have now defined a low-level

graphics protocol.  UCSB has agreed to send graphics output to us

using this protocol.  We have had to program new processes for the

IMLAC and are now debugging the new programs.  Due to the limited

core available on the particular IMLAC that we are using (4K 16 bit

words) which limits the size of internal display lists, we will not

<span class="grey">be able to plot very complex graphs.  However, the software being</span>

developed is general and can be moved to an IMLAC with larger core

capacity.  We currently send alphanumeric input from a TTY or 3300

and divert the graphics output to the IMLAC.

     When we can access the Culler-Fried system for graphics output

successfully via the network, we plan to modify the IMLAC programs to

permit alpha input from the IMLAC keyboard.  We also plan to investi-

gate the possibility of attaching a function keyboard to the IMLAC.

Lastly, we intend to investigate the use of TICCIT display devices

with the TIP.  A sample mathematics course will be designed to assist

in demonstration of the CAI applications of the Culler-Fried system.

We are currently studying the past uses of the system in a CAI mode.

     We have not yet investigated computer science curriculums.  We

plan to get inputs from the ACM Committee on Computer Science Educa-

tion(36,37) and to visit universities in the Washington area.  This

activity is scheduled to commence in April.

     (b)  Demonstrate that the TICCIT/CAI system can be supplemented
          with specialized CAI systems that use AI techniques.

The two network resources selected for demonstration are SCHOLAR and

LOGO.  Both systems are implemented in LISP and are currently avail-

able over the network on the TENEX system at BBN.  A version of LOGO

with a "display turtle" is available on the PDP-10 at MIT/AI, however,

they do not yet have their NCP implemented and thus are not currently

accessible over the network. There is also a version of LOGO on the

TENEX system at SRI/AI. They also are not currently connected to the

<span class="grey">network and we have not investigated their version.</span>

     We used SCHOLAR over the network in January with a data base

provided by BBN to review the knowledge of a student in the geography

of South America(38,39).

     The LOGO system at MIT/AI is perhaps the most impressive system

for use in a demonstration due to the availability of a "display

turtle". The system is currently being used remotely by the Bridge

School in Lexington, Massachusetts. We visited the school and observed

a class in session. We also attended an undergraduate class in Applied

Math at MIT that was learning turtle geometry.

     Seymour Papert of MIT expects the MIT/AI PDP-10 to be up on the

network by the middle of April(40). He has agreed to modify his system

to interface with our IMLAC via the network using the low-level graphics

protocol that we specified. He has developed many courses and games

using LOGO(41,42,43,44,45) that provide sufficient material for use

in demonstrating the system. A real turtle may be available in early

summer to run from our TIP.

     We have used the LOGO system at BBN via the network. Since the

system is continually being modified, Dr. Feurzeig agreed to put a

clean version on the RAND TENEX for our use. BBN's LOGO does not

currently have a display turtle, however, they are willing to imple-

ment one. Even without the display turtle, courseware that has been

developed for teaching mathematics provides sufficient material for

us to work from(46,47). A radio controlled turtle has been designed

built at MITRE to run from our TIP.

     (c)  Demonstrate that TICCIT system resources and capabilities
          can be augmented by using computing and storage resources
          available on the network.

Work has not begun on this subtask.  However, much of the software

developed for the data sharing experiments can be used to store and

retrieve data on a demand basis.

     We have received preliminary curriculum material from TICCIT

personnel. We expect to interact with them to determine more speci-

fically the format and requirements for curriculum material and student

records.
