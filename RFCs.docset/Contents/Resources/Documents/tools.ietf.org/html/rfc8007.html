Abstract

   This document describes the part of the Content Delivery Network
   Interconnection (CDNI) Control interface that allows a CDN to trigger
   activity in an interconnected CDN that is configured to deliver
   content on its behalf.  The upstream CDN can use this mechanism to
   request that the downstream CDN pre-position metadata or content or
   to request that it invalidate or purge metadata or content.  The
   upstream CDN can monitor the status of activity that it has triggered
   in the downstream CDN.

   This document reuses the terminology defined in [<a href="rfc6707.html" title='"Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) Problem Statement"'>RFC6707</a>] and uses
   "uCDN" and "dCDN" as shorthand for "upstream CDN" and "downstream
   CDN", respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   A CI/T Command, sent from the uCDN to the dCDN, is a request for the
   dCDN to do some work relating to data associated with content
   requests originating from the uCDN.

   There are two types of CI/T Commands: CI/T Trigger Commands and CI/T
   Cancel Commands.  The CI/T Cancel Command can be used to request
   cancellation of an earlier CI/T Trigger Command.  A CI/T Trigger
   Command is of one of the following types:

   o  preposition - used to instruct the dCDN to fetch metadata from the
      uCDN, or content from any origin including the uCDN.

   o  invalidate - used to instruct the dCDN to revalidate specific
      metadata or content before reusing it.

   o  purge - used to instruct the dCDN to delete specific metadata or
      content.

   The CI/T interface is a web service offered by the dCDN.  It allows
   CI/T Commands to be issued and allows triggered activity to be
   tracked.  The CI/T interface builds on top of HTTP/1.1 [<a href="rfc7230.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>].
   References to URL in this document relate to HTTP/HTTPS URIs, as
   defined in <a href="rfc7230.html#section-2.7">Section 2.7 of [RFC7230]</a>.

   When the dCDN accepts a CI/T Command, it creates a resource
   describing the status of the triggered activity -- a Trigger Status
   Resource.  The uCDN can poll Trigger Status Resources to monitor
   progress.

   The dCDN maintains at least one collection of Trigger Status
   Resources for each uCDN.  Each uCDN only has access to its own
   collections, the locations of which are shared when CDNI is
   established.






<span class="grey">Murray &amp; Niven-Jenkins       Standards Track                    [Page 4]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc8007.html">RFC 8007</a>                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016</span>


   To trigger activity in the dCDN, the uCDN POSTs a CI/T Command to the
   collection of Trigger Status Resources.  If the dCDN accepts the CI/T
   Command, it creates a new Trigger Status Resource and returns its
   location to the uCDN.  To monitor progress, the uCDN can GET the
   Trigger Status Resource.  To request cancellation of a CI/T Trigger
   Command, the uCDN can POST to the collection of Trigger Status
   Resources or simply delete the Trigger Status Resource.

   In addition to the collection of all Trigger Status Resources for the
   uCDN, the dCDN can maintain filtered views of that collection.  These
   filtered views are defined in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> and include collections of
   Trigger Status Resources corresponding to active and completed CI/T
   Trigger Commands.  These collections provide a mechanism for polling
   the status of multiple jobs.

   Figure 1 is an example showing the basic message flow used by the
   uCDN to trigger activity in the dCDN and for the uCDN to discover the
   status of that activity.  Only successful triggering is shown.
   Examples of the messages are given in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.

   The steps in Figure 1 are as follows:

   1.  The uCDN triggers action in the dCDN by POSTing a CI/T Command to
       a collection of Trigger Status Resources --
       "https://dcdn.example.com/triggers/uCDN".  This URL was given to
       the uCDN when the CI/T interface was established.

   2.  The dCDN authenticates the request, validates the CI/T Command,
       and, if it accepts the request, creates a new Trigger Status
       Resource.

   3.  The dCDN responds to the uCDN with an HTTP 201 response status
       and the location of the Trigger Status Resource.

   4.  The uCDN can poll, possibly repeatedly, the Trigger Status
       Resource in the dCDN.

   5.  The dCDN responds with the Trigger Status Resource, describing
       the progress or results of the CI/T Trigger Command.

   The remainder of this document describes the messages, Trigger Status
   Resources, and collections of Trigger Status Resources in more
   detail.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.1.%20%20Timing%20of%20Triggered%20Activity"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Timing of Triggered Activity</span>

   Timing of the execution of CI/T Commands is under the dCDN's control,
   including its start time and pacing of the activity in the network.

   CI/T "invalidate" and "purge" commands MUST be applied to all data
   acquired before the command was accepted by the dCDN.  The dCDN
   SHOULD NOT apply CI/T "invalidate" and "purge" commands to data
   acquired after the CI/T Command was accepted, but this may not always
   be achievable, so the uCDN cannot count on that.

   If the uCDN wishes to invalidate or purge content and then
   immediately pre-position replacement content at the same URLs, it
   SHOULD ensure that the dCDN has completed the invalidate/purge before
   initiating the pre-positioning.  Otherwise, there is a risk that the
   dCDN pre-positions the new content, then immediately invalidates or
   purges it (as a result of the two uCDN requests running in parallel).

   Because the CI/T Command timing is under the dCDN's control, the dCDN
   implementation can choose whether to apply CI/T "invalidate" and
   "purge" commands to content acquisition that has already started when
   the command is received.

   Each CI/T Command can operate on multiple metadata and content URLs.

   Multiple representations of an HTTP resource may share the same URL.
   CI/T Trigger Commands that invalidate or purge metadata or content
   apply to all resource representations with matching URLs.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.1.%20%20Multiple%20Interconnected%20CDNs"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2.1" name="section-2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.  Multiple Interconnected CDNs</span>

   In a network of interconnected CDNs, a single uCDN will originate a
   given item of metadata and associated content.  It may distribute
   that metadata and content to more than one dCDN, which may in turn
   distribute that metadata and content to CDNs located further
   downstream.

   An intermediate CDN is a dCDN that passes on CDNI Metadata and
   content to dCDNs located further downstream.

   A "diamond" configuration is one where a dCDN can acquire metadata
   and content originated in one uCDN from that uCDN itself and an
   intermediate CDN, or via more than one intermediate CDN.

   CI/T Commands originating in the single source uCDN affect metadata
   and content in all dCDNs; however, in a diamond configuration, it may
   not be possible for the dCDN to determine which uCDN it acquired
   content from.  In this case, a dCDN MUST allow each uCDN from which
   it may have acquired the content to act upon that content using CI/T
   Commands.

   In all other cases, a dCDN MUST reject CI/T Commands from a uCDN that
   attempts to act on another uCDN's content by using, for example,
   HTTP 403 ("Forbidden").

   Security considerations are discussed further in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.

   The diamond configuration may lead to inefficient interactions, but
   the interactions are otherwise harmless.  For example:

   o  When the uCDN issues an "invalidate" CI/T Command, a dCDN will
      receive that command from multiple directly connected uCDNs.  The
      dCDN may schedule multiple such commands separately, and the last
      scheduled command may affect content already revalidated following
      execution of the "invalidate" command that was scheduled first.

   o  If one of a dCDN's directly connected uCDNs loses its rights to
      distribute content, it may issue a CI/T "purge" command.  That
      purge may affect content the dCDN could retain because it's
      distributed by another directly connected uCDN.  But, that content
      can be reacquired by the dCDN from the remaining uCDN.

   o  When the uCDN originating an item of content issues a CI/T purge
      followed by a pre-position, two directly connected uCDNs will pass
      those commands to a dCDN.  That dCDN implementation need not merge
      those operations or notice the repetition, in which case the purge
      issued by one uCDN will complete before the other.  The first uCDN
      to finish its purge may then forward the "preposition" trigger,
      and content pre-positioned as a result might be affected by the
      still-running purge issued by the other uCDN.  However, the dCDN
      will reacquire that content as needed, or when it's asked to
      pre-position the content by the second uCDN.  A dCDN
      implementation could avoid this interaction by knowing which uCDN
      it acquired the content from, or it could minimize the
      consequences by recording the time at which the
      "invalidate"/"purge" command was received and not applying it to
      content acquired after that time.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.3.%20%20Trigger%20Results"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3</a>.  Trigger Results</span>

   Possible states for a Trigger Status Resource are defined in
   <a href="#section-5.2.3">Section 5.2.3</a>.

   The CI/T Trigger Command MUST NOT be reported as "complete" until all
   actions have been completed successfully.  The reasons for failure,
   and URLs or patterns affected, SHOULD be enumerated in the Trigger
   Status Resource.  For more details, see <a href="#section-4.7">Section 4.7</a>.

   If a dCDN is also acting as a uCDN in a cascade, it MUST forward CI/T
   Commands to any dCDNs that may be affected.  The CI/T Trigger Command
   MUST NOT be reported as "complete" in a CDN until it is "complete" in
   all of its dCDNs.  If a CI/T Trigger Command is reported as
   "processed" in any dCDN, intermediate CDNs MUST NOT report
   "complete"; instead, they MUST also report "processed".  A CI/T
   Command MAY be reported as "failed" as soon as it fails in a CDN or
   in any of its dCDNs.  A canceled CI/T Trigger Command MUST be
   reported as "cancelling" until it has been reported as "cancelled",
   "complete", or "failed" by all dCDNs in a cascade.

   As described in <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>, Trigger Status Resources exist in the dCDN
   to report the status of activity triggered by each uCDN.

   A collection of Trigger Status Resources is a resource that contains
   a reference to each Trigger Status Resource in that collection.

   The dCDN MUST make a collection of a uCDN's Trigger Status Resources
   available to that uCDN.  This collection includes all of the Trigger
   Status Resources created for CI/T Commands from the uCDN that have
   been accepted by the dCDN, and have not yet been deleted by the uCDN,
   or expired and removed by the dCDN (as described in <a href="#section-4.4">Section 4.4</a>).
   Trigger Status Resources belonging to a uCDN MUST NOT be visible to
   any other CDN.  The dCDN could, for example, achieve this by offering
   different collection URLs to each uCDN and by filtering the response
   based on the uCDN with which the HTTP client is associated.

   To trigger activity in a dCDN or to cancel triggered activity, the
   uCDN POSTs a CI/T Command to the dCDN's collection of the uCDN's
   Trigger Status Resources.

   In order to allow the uCDN to check the status of multiple jobs in a
   single request, the dCDN MAY also maintain collections representing
   filtered views of the collection of all Trigger Status Resources.
   These filtered collections are "optional-to-implement", but if they
   are implemented, the dCDN MUST include links to them in the
   collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  The filtered
   collections are:

   o  Pending - Trigger Status Resources for CI/T Trigger Commands that
      have been accepted but not yet acted upon.

   o  Active - Trigger Status Resources for CI/T Trigger Commands that
      are currently being processed in the dCDN.

   o  Complete - Trigger Status Resources representing activity that
      completed successfully, and "processed" CI/T Trigger Commands for
      which no further status updates will be made by the dCDN.

   o  Failed - Trigger Status Resources representing CI/T Commands that
      failed or were canceled by the uCDN.

   This section describes an interface to enable a uCDN to trigger
   activity in a dCDN.

   The CI/T interface builds on top of HTTP, so dCDNs may make use of
   any HTTP feature when implementing the CI/T interface.  For example,
   a dCDN SHOULD make use of HTTP's caching mechanisms to indicate that
   a requested response/representation has not been modified, reducing
   the uCDN's processing needed to determine whether the status of
   triggered activity has changed.

   All dCDNs implementing CI/T MUST support the HTTP GET, HEAD, POST,
   and DELETE methods as defined in [<a href="rfc7231.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content"'>RFC7231</a>].

   The only representation specified in this document is JSON [<a href="rfc7159.html" title='"The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format"'>RFC7159</a>].
   It MUST be supported by the uCDN and by the dCDN.

   The URL of the dCDN's collection of all Trigger Status Resources
   needs to be either discovered by or configured in the uCDN.  The
   mechanism for discovery of that URL is outside the scope of this
   document.

   CI/T Commands are POSTed to the dCDN's collection of all Trigger
   Status Resources.  If a CI/T Trigger Command is accepted by the dCDN,
   the dCDN creates a new Trigger Status Resource and returns its URI to
   the uCDN in an HTTP 201 response.  The triggered activity can then be
   monitored by the uCDN using that resource and the collections
   described in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.

   The URI of each Trigger Status Resource is returned to the uCDN when
   it is created, and URIs of all Trigger Status Resources are listed in
   the dCDN's collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  This means
   all Trigger Status Resources can be discovered by the uCDN, so dCDNs
   are free to assign whatever structure they desire to the URIs for
   CI/T resources.  Therefore, uCDNs MUST NOT make any assumptions
   regarding the structure of CI/T URIs or the mapping between CI/T
   objects and their associated URIs.  URIs present in the examples in
   this document are purely illustrative and are not intended to impose
   a definitive structure on CI/T interface implementations.

   To issue a CI/T Command, the uCDN makes an HTTP POST to the dCDN's
   collection of all of the uCDN's Trigger Status Resources.  The
   request body of that POST is a CI/T Command, as described in
   <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a>.

   The dCDN validates the CI/T Command.  If the command is malformed or
   the uCDN does not have sufficient access rights, the dCDN MUST either
   respond with an appropriate 4xx HTTP error code and not create a
   Trigger Status Resource or create a "failed" Trigger Status Resource
   containing an appropriate Error Description.

   When a CI/T Trigger Command is accepted, the uCDN MUST create a new
   Trigger Status Resource that will convey a specification of the CI/T
   Command and its current status.  The HTTP response to the dCDN MUST
   have status code 201 and MUST convey the URI of the Trigger Status
   Resource in the Location header field [<a href="rfc7231.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content"'>RFC7231</a>].  The HTTP response
   SHOULD include the content of the newly created Trigger Status
   Resource.  This is particularly important in cases where the CI/T
   Trigger Command has completed immediately.

   Once a Trigger Status Resource has been created, the dCDN MUST NOT
   reuse its URI, even after that Trigger Status Resource has been
   removed.

   The dCDN SHOULD track and report on the progress of CI/T Trigger
   Commands using a Trigger Status Resource (<a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a>).  If the
   dCDN is not able to do that, it MUST indicate that it has accepted
   the request but will not be providing further status updates.  To do
   this, it sets the status of the Trigger Status Resource to
   "processed".  In this case, CI/T processing should continue as for a
   "complete" request, so the Trigger Status Resource MUST be added to
   the dCDN's collection of complete Trigger Status Resources.  The dCDN
   SHOULD also provide an estimated completion time for the request by
   using the "etime" property of the Trigger Status Resource.  This will
   allow the uCDN to schedule pre-positioning after an earlier delete of
   the same URLs is expected to have finished.

   If the dCDN is able to track the execution of CI/T Commands and a
   CI/T Command is queued by the dCDN for later action, the "status"
   property of the Trigger Status Resource MUST be "pending".  Once
   processing has started, the status MUST be "active".  Finally, once
   the CI/T Command is complete, the status MUST be set to "complete" or
   "failed".

   A CI/T Trigger Command may result in no activity in the dCDN if, for
   example, it is an "invalidate" or "purge" request for data the dCDN
   has not yet acquired, or a "preposition" request for data that it has
   already acquired and that is still valid.  In this case, the status
   of the Trigger Status Resource MUST be "processed" or "complete", and
   the Trigger Status Resource MUST be added to the dCDN's collection of
   complete Trigger Status Resources.

   Once created, Trigger Status Resources can be canceled or deleted by
   the uCDN, but not modified.  The dCDN MUST reject PUT and POST
   requests from the uCDN to Trigger Status Resources by responding with
   an appropriate HTTP status code -- for example, 405 ("Method Not
   Allowed").

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.%20%20Checking%20Status"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Checking Status</span>

   The uCDN has two ways to check the progress of CI/T Commands it has
   issued to the dCDN, as described in Sections <a href="#section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a> and <a href="#section-4.2.2">4.2.2</a>.

   To allow the uCDN to check for changes in the status of a Trigger
   Status Resource or collection of Trigger Status Resources without
   refetching the whole resource or collection, the dCDN SHOULD include
   entity-tags (ETags) for the uCDN to use as cache validators, as
   defined in [<a href="rfc7232.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests"'>RFC7232</a>].

   The dCDN SHOULD use the cache control headers for responses to GETs
   for Trigger Status Resources and Collections to indicate the
   frequency at which it recommends that the uCDN should poll for
   change.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.1.%20%20Polling%20Trigger%20Status%20Resource%20Collections"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1" name="section-4.2.1">4.2.1</a>.  Polling Trigger Status Resource Collections</span>

   The uCDN can fetch the collection of its Trigger Status Resources or
   filtered views of that collection.

   This makes it possible to poll the status of all CI/T Trigger
   Commands in a single request.  If the dCDN moves a Trigger Status
   Resource from the active to the completed collection, the uCDN can
   fetch the result of that activity.

   When polling in this way, the uCDN SHOULD use HTTP ETags to monitor
   for change, rather than repeatedly fetching the whole collection.  An
   example of this is given in <a href="#section-6.2.4">Section 6.2.4</a>.

   The uCDN has a URI provided by the dCDN for each Trigger Status
   Resource it has created.  It may fetch that Trigger Status Resource
   at any time.

   This can be used to retrieve progress information and to fetch the
   result of the CI/T Command.

   When polling in this way, the uCDN SHOULD use HTTP ETags to monitor
   for change, rather than repeatedly fetching the Trigger Status
   Resource.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.3.%20%20Canceling%20Triggers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.3" name="section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Canceling Triggers</span>

   The uCDN can request cancellation of a CI/T Trigger Command by
   POSTing a CI/T Cancel Command to the collection of all Trigger Status
   Resources.

   The dCDN is required to accept and respond to the CI/T Cancel
   Command, but the actual cancellation of a CI/T Trigger Command is
   optional-to-implement.

   The dCDN MUST respond to the CI/T Cancel Command appropriately -- for
   example, with HTTP status code 200 ("OK") if the cancellation has
   been processed and the CI/T Command is inactive, 202 ("Accepted") if
   the command has been accepted but the CI/T Command remains active, or
   501 ("Not Implemented") if cancellation is not supported by the dCDN.

   If cancellation of a "pending" Trigger Status Resource is accepted by
   the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD NOT start the processing of that activity.
   Issuing a CI/T Cancel Command for a "pending" Trigger Status Resource
   does not, however, guarantee that the corresponding activity will not
   be started, because the uCDN cannot control the timing of that
   activity.  Processing could, for example, start after the POST is
   sent by the uCDN but before that request is processed by the dCDN.

   If cancellation of an "active" or "processed" Trigger Status Resource
   is accepted by the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD stop processing the CI/T
   Command.  However, as with cancellation of a "pending" CI/T Command,
   the dCDN does not guarantee this.

   If the CI/T Command cannot be stopped immediately, the status in the
   corresponding Trigger Status Resource MUST be set to "cancelling",
   and the Trigger Status Resource MUST remain in the collection of
   Trigger Status Resources for active CI/T Commands.  If processing is
   stopped before normal completion, the status value in the Trigger

   Status Resource MUST be set to "cancelled", and the Trigger Status
   Resource MUST be included in the collection of failed CI/T Trigger
   Commands.

   Cancellation of a "complete" or "failed" Trigger Status Resource
   requires no processing in the dCDN.  Its status MUST NOT be changed
   to "cancelled".

   The uCDN can delete Trigger Status Resources at any time, using the
   HTTP DELETE method.  The effect is similar to cancellation, but no
   Trigger Status Resource remains afterwards.

   Once deleted, the references to a Trigger Status Resource MUST be
   removed from all Trigger Status Resource collections.  Subsequent
   requests to GET the deleted Trigger Status Resource SHOULD be
   rejected by the dCDN with an HTTP error.

   If a "pending" Trigger Status Resource is deleted, the dCDN
   SHOULD NOT start the processing of that activity.  Deleting a
   "pending" Trigger Status Resource does not, however, guarantee that
   it has not started, because the uCDN cannot control the timing of
   that activity.  Processing may, for example, start after the DELETE
   is sent by the uCDN but before that request is processed by the dCDN.

   If an "active" or "processed" Trigger Status Resource is deleted, the
   dCDN SHOULD stop processing the CI/T Command.  However, as with
   deletion of a "pending" Trigger Status Resource, the dCDN does not
   guarantee this.

   Deletion of a "complete" or "failed" Trigger Status Resource requires
   no processing in the dCDN other than deletion of the Trigger Status
   Resource.

   The dCDN can choose to automatically delete Trigger Status Resources
   some time after they become "complete", "processed", "failed", or
   "cancelled".  In this case, the dCDN will remove the Trigger Status
   Resource and respond to subsequent requests for it with an HTTP
   error.

   RECOMMENDED that Trigger Status Resources are not automatically
   deleted by the dCDN for at least 24 hours after they become
   "complete", "processed", "failed", or "cancelled".

   To ensure that it is able to get the status of its Trigger Status
   Resources for completed and failed CI/T Commands, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the uCDN polling interval is less than the time after which
   records for completed activity will be deleted.

   Given three CDNs, A, B, and C, if CDNs B and C delegate delivery of
   CDN A's content to each other, CDN A's CI/T Commands could be passed
   between CDNs B and C in a loop.  More complex networks of CDNs could
   contain similar loops involving more hops.

   In order to prevent and detect such CI/T loops, each CDN uses a CDN
   Provider ID (PID) to uniquely identify itself.  In every CI/T Command
   it originates or cascades, each CDN MUST append an array element
   containing its CDN PID to a JSON array under an entry named
   "cdn-path".  When receiving CI/T Commands, a dCDN MUST check the
   cdn-path and reject any CI/T Command that already contains its own
   CDN PID in the cdn-path.  Transit CDNs MUST check the cdn-path and
   not cascade the CI/T Command to dCDNs that are already listed in the
   cdn-path.

   The CDN PID consists of the two characters "AS" followed by the CDN
   provider's Autonomous System number [<a href="rfc1930.html" title='"Guidelines for creation, selection, and registration of an Autonomous System (AS)"'>RFC1930</a>], then a colon (":") and
   an additional qualifier that is used to guarantee uniqueness in case
   a particular AS has multiple independent CDNs deployed -- for
   example, "AS64496:0".

   If the CDN provider has multiple ASes, the same AS number SHOULD be
   used in all messages from that CDN provider, unless there are
   multiple distinct CDNs.

   If the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface (RI) described in
   [<a href="rfc7975.html" title='"Request Routing Redirection Interface for Content Delivery Network (CDN) Interconnection"'>RFC7975</a>] is implemented by the dCDN, the CI/T interface and the RI
   SHOULD use the same CDN PID.

   A dCDN can signal rejection of a CI/T Command using HTTP status codes
   -- for example, 400 ("Bad Request") if the request is malformed, or
   403 ("Forbidden") or 404 ("Not Found") if the uCDN does not have
   permission to issue CI/T Commands or it is trying to act on another
   CDN's data.

   If any part of the CI/T Trigger Command fails, the trigger SHOULD be
   reported as "failed" once its activity is complete or if no further
   errors will be reported.  The "errors" property in the Trigger Status
   Resource will be used to enumerate which actions failed and the
   reasons for failure, and can be present while the Trigger Status
   Resource is still "pending" or "active", if the CI/T Trigger Command
   is still running for some URLs or patterns in the Trigger
   Specification.

   Once a request has been accepted, processing errors are reported in
   the Trigger Status Resource using a list of Error Descriptions.  Each
   Error Description is used to report errors against one or more of the
   URLs or patterns in the Trigger Specification.

   If a Surrogate affected by a CI/T Trigger Command is offline in the
   dCDN or the dCDN is unable to pass a CI/T Command on to any of its
   cascaded dCDNs:

   o  If the CI/T Command is abandoned by the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD
      report an error.

   o  A CI/T "invalidate" command may be reported as "complete" when
      Surrogates that may have the data are offline.  In this case,
      Surrogates MUST NOT use the affected data without first
      revalidating it when they are back online.

   o  CI/T "preposition" and "purge" commands can be reported as
      "processed" if affected caches are offline and the activity will
      complete when they return to service.

   o  Otherwise, the dCDN SHOULD keep the Trigger Status Resource in
      state "pending" or "active" until either the CI/T Command is acted
      upon or the uCDN chooses to cancel it.

   If content URLs are transformed by an intermediate CDN in a cascade,
   that intermediate CDN MUST similarly transform URLs in CI/T Commands
   it passes to its dCDN.

   When processing Trigger Specifications, CDNs MUST ignore the URL
   scheme (HTTP or HTTPS) in comparing URLs.  For example, for a CI/T
   "invalidate" or "purge" command, content MUST be invalidated or
   purged regardless of the protocol clients used to request it.

   Trigger Type is used in a Trigger Specification to describe trigger
   action.

   All trigger types MUST be registered in the IANA "CDNI CI/T Trigger
   Types" registry (see <a href="#section-7.2">Section 7.2</a>).

   A dCDN receiving a request containing a trigger type it does not
   recognize or does not support MUST reject the request by creating a
   Trigger Status Resource with a status of "failed" and the "errors"
   array containing an Error Description with error "eunsupported".

   The following trigger types are defined by this document:

   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
   | JSON String | Description                                         |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
   | preposition | A request for the dCDN to acquire metadata or       |
   |             | content.                                            |
   | invalidate  | A request for the dCDN to invalidate metadata or    |
   |             | content.  After servicing this request, the dCDN    |
   |             | will not use the specified data without first       |
   |             | revalidating it using, for example, an              |
   |             | "If-None-Match" HTTP request.  The dCDN need not    |
   |             | erase the associated data.                          |
   | purge       | A request for the dCDN to erase metadata or         |
   |             | content.  After servicing the request, the          |
   |             | specified data MUST NOT be held on the dCDN (the    |
   |             | dCDN should reacquire the metadata or content from  |
   |             | the uCDN if it needs it).                           |

   A PatternMatch consists of a string pattern to match against a URI,
   and flags describing the type of match.

   It is encoded as a JSON object with the following name/value pairs:

      Name: pattern

         Description: A pattern for URI matching.

         Value: A JSON string representing the pattern.  The pattern can
         contain the wildcards * and ?, where * matches any sequence of
         [<a href="rfc3986.html" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>] pchar or "/" characters (including the empty string)
         and ? matches exactly one [<a href="rfc3986.html" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>] pchar character.  The three
         literals $, * and ? MUST be escaped as $$, $* and $? (where $
         is the designated escape character).  All other characters are
         treated as literals.

         Mandatory: Yes.

      Name: case-sensitive

         Description: Flag indicating whether or not case-sensitive
         matching should be used.

         Value: One of the JSON values "true" (the matching is case
         sensitive) or "false" (the matching is case insensitive).

         Mandatory: No; default is case-insensitive match.

      Name: match-query-string

         Description: Flag indicating whether to include the query part
         of the URI when comparing against the pattern.

         Value: One of the JSON values "true" (the full URI, including
         the query part, should be compared against the given pattern)
         or "false" (the query part of the URI should be dropped before
         comparison with the given pattern).

   An Error Description is used to report the failure of a CI/T Command
   or failure in the activity it triggered.  It is encoded as a JSON
   object with the following name/value pairs:

      Name: error

         Value: Error Code, as defined in <a href="#section-5.2.7">Section 5.2.7</a>.

         Mandatory: Yes.

      Names: metadata.urls, content.urls, metadata.patterns,
      content.patterns

         Description: Metadata and content references copied from the
         Trigger Specification.  Only those URLs and patterns to which
         the error applies are included in each property, but those URLs
         and patterns MUST be exactly as they appear in the request; the
         dCDN MUST NOT generalize the URLs.  (For example, if the uCDN
         requests pre-positioning of URLs

         its error report to the pattern
         "https://content.example.com/*".)

         Value: A JSON array of JSON strings, where each string is
         copied from a "content.*" or "metadata.*" value in the
         corresponding Trigger Specification.

         Mandatory: At least one of these name/value pairs is mandatory
         in each Error Description object.

      Name: description

         Description: A human-readable description of the error.

         Value: A JSON string, the human-readable description.

   This type is used by the dCDN to report failures in trigger
   processing.  All Error Codes MUST be registered in the IANA "CDNI
   CI/T Error Codes" registry (see <a href="#section-7.3">Section 7.3</a>).  Unknown Error Codes
   MUST be treated as fatal errors, and the request MUST NOT be
   automatically retried without modification.

   Below is an example of a CI/T "invalidate" command -- another POST to
   the collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  This instructs the
   dCDN to revalidate the content at "https://www.example.com/a/
   index.html", as well as any metadata and content whose URLs are
   prefixed by "https://metadata.example.com/a/b/" using
   case-insensitive matching, and "https://www.example.com/a/b/" using
   case-sensitive matching, respectively.

   Once Trigger Status Resources have been created, the uCDN can check
   their status as shown in the following examples.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.2.1.%20%20Collection%20of%20All%20Triggers"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.2.1" name="section-6.2.1">6.2.1</a>.  Collection of All Triggers</span>

   The uCDN can fetch the collection of all Trigger Status Resources it
   has created that have not yet been deleted or removed as expired.
   After creation of the "preposition" and "invalidate" triggers shown
   above, this collection might look as follows:

   REQUEST:

   The filtered collections are also available to the uCDN.  Before the
   dCDN starts processing the two CI/T Trigger Commands shown above,
   both will appear in the collection of pending triggers.  For example:

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers/pending HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com
     Accept: */*

         ]
     }

   At this point, if no other Trigger Status Resources had been created,
   the other filtered views would be empty.  For example:

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers/complete HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com

   The CI/T interface provides a mechanism to allow a uCDN to generate
   requests into the dCDN and to inspect its own CI/T requests and their
   current states.  The CI/T interface does not allow access to, or
   modification of, the uCDN or dCDN metadata relating to content
   delivery or to the content itself.  It can only control the presence
   of that metadata in the dCDN, and the processing work and network
   utilization involved in ensuring that presence.

   By examining "preposition" requests to a dCDN, and correctly
   interpreting content and metadata URLs, an attacker could learn the
   uCDN's or content owner's predictions for future content popularity.
   By examining "invalidate" or "purge" requests, an attacker could
   learn about changes in the content owner's catalog.

   By injecting CI/T Commands, an attacker or a misbehaving uCDN would
   generate work in the dCDN and uCDN as they process those requests.
   So would a man-in-the-middle attacker modifying valid CI/T Commands
   generated by the uCDN.  In both cases, that would decrease the dCDN's
   caching efficiency by causing it to unnecessarily acquire or
   reacquire content metadata and/or content.

   A dCDN implementation of CI/T MUST restrict the actions of a uCDN to
   the data corresponding to that uCDN.  Failure to do so would allow
   uCDNs to detrimentally affect each other's efficiency by generating
   unnecessary acquisition or reacquisition load.

   An origin that chooses to delegate its delivery to a CDN is trusting
   that CDN to deliver content on its behalf; the interconnection of
   CDNs is an extension of that trust to dCDNs.  That trust relationship
   is a commercial arrangement, outside the scope of the CDNI protocols.
   So, while a malicious CDN could deliberately generate load on a dCDN
   using the CI/T interface, the protocol does not otherwise attempt to
   address malicious behavior between interconnected CDNs.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Protection"></a>      Protection</span>

   A CI/T implementation MUST support Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   transport for HTTP (HTTPS) as per [<a href="rfc2818.html" title='"HTTP Over TLS"'>RFC2818</a>] and [<a href="rfc7230.html" title='"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"'>RFC7230</a>].

   TLS MUST be used by the server side (dCDN) and the client side (uCDN)
   of the CI/T interface, including authentication of the remote end,
   unless alternate methods are used for ensuring the security of the
   information in the CI/T interface requests and responses (such as
   setting up an IPsec tunnel between the two CDNs or using a physically
   secured internal network between two CDNs that are owned by the same
   corporate entity).

   The use of TLS for transport of the CI/T interface allows the dCDN
   and the uCDN to authenticate each other using TLS client
   authentication and TLS server authentication.

   Once the dCDN and the uCDN have mutually authenticated each other,
   TLS allows:

   o  The dCDN and the uCDN to authorize each other (to ensure that they
      are receiving CI/T Commands from, or reporting status to, an
      authorized CDN).

   o  CDNI commands and responses to be transmitted with
      confidentiality.

   o  Protection of the integrity of CDNI commands and responses.

   When TLS is used, the general TLS usage guidance in [<a href="rfc7525.html" title='"Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)"'>RFC7525</a>] MUST be
   followed.

   The mechanisms for access control are dCDN-specific and are not
   standardized as part of this CI/T specification.

   HTTP requests that attempt to access or operate on CI/T data
   belonging to another CDN MUST be rejected using, for example,
   HTTP 403 ("Forbidden") or 404 ("Not Found").  This is intended to
   prevent unauthorized users from generating unnecessary load in dCDNs
   or uCDNs due to revalidation, reacquisition, or unnecessary
   acquisition.

   When deploying a network of interconnected CDNs, the possible
   inefficiencies related to the diamond configuration discussed in
   <a href="#section-2.2.1">Section 2.2.1</a> should be considered.

   This document does not define a specific mechanism to protect against
   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the CI/T interface.  However, CI/T
   endpoints can be protected against DoS attacks through the use of TLS
   transport and/or via mechanisms outside the scope of the CI/T
   interface, such as firewalling or the use of Virtual Private Networks
   (VPNs).

   Depending on the implementation, triggered activity may consume
   significant processing and bandwidth in the dCDN.  A malicious or
   faulty uCDN could use this to generate unnecessary load in the dCDN.
   The dCDN should consider mechanisms to avoid overload -- for example,
   by rate-limiting acceptance or processing of CI/T Commands, or by
   performing batch processing.

   The CI/T protocol does not carry any information about individual end
   users of a CDN; there are no privacy concerns for end users.

   The CI/T protocol does carry information that could be considered
   commercially sensitive by CDN operators and content owners.  The use
   of mutually authenticated TLS to establish a secure session for the
   transport of CI/T data, as discussed in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>, provides
   confidentiality while the CI/T data is in transit and prevents
   parties other than the authorized dCDN from gaining access to that
   data.  The dCDN MUST ensure that it only exposes CI/T data related to
   a uCDN to clients it has authenticated as belonging to that uCDN.

   This appendix is non-normative.

   The JSON data described in this document has been formalized using
   the CBOR Data Definition Language (CDDL) [<a href="#ref-CBOR-CDDL">CBOR-CDDL</a>] (where "CBOR"
   means "Concise Binary Object Representation"), as follows:
