Abstract

   This document describes the Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP),
   an extensible configuration protocol, and a set of requirements for
   home network devices.  HNCP is described as a profile of and
   extension to the Distributed Node Consensus Protocol (DNCP).  HNCP
   enables discovery of network borders, automated configuration of
   addresses, name resolution, service discovery, and the use of any
   routing protocol that supports routing based on both the source and
   destination address.

   The Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP) is designed to facilitate
   the sharing of state among home routers to fulfill the needs of the
   IPv6 homenet architecture [<a href="rfc7368.html" title='"IPv6 Home Networking Architecture Principles"'>RFC7368</a>], which assumes zero-configuration
   operation, multiple subnets, multiple home routers, and (potentially)
   multiple upstream service providers providing (potentially) multiple
   prefixes to the home network.  While <a href="rfc7368.html">RFC 7368</a> sets no requirements
   for IPv4 support, HNCP aims to support the dual-stack mode of
   operation, and therefore the functionality is designed with that in
   mind.  The state is shared as TLVs transported in the DNCP node state
   among the routers (and potentially advanced hosts) to enable:

   o  Autonomic discovery of network borders (<a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>) based on
      Distributed Node Consensus Protocol (DNCP) topology.

   o  Automated portioning of prefixes delegated by the service
      providers as well as assigned prefixes to both HNCP and non-HNCP
      routers (<a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>) using [<a href="rfc7695.html" title='"Distributed Prefix Assignment Algorithm"'>RFC7695</a>].  Prefixes assigned to HNCP
      routers are used to:

      *  Provide addresses to non-HNCP aware nodes (using Stateless
         Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) and DHCP).




<span class="grey">Stenberg, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7788.html">RFC 7788</a>            Home Networking Control Protocol          April 2016</span>


      *  Provide space in which HNCP nodes assign their own addresses
         (<a href="#section-6.4">Section 6.4</a>).

   o  Internal and external name resolution, as well as multi-link
      service discovery (<a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>).

   o  Other services not defined in this document that do need to share
      state among homenet nodes and do not cause rapid and constant TLV
      changes (see the following applicability section).

   HNCP is a protocol based on DNCP [<a href="rfc7787.html" title='"Distributed Node Consensus Protocol"'>RFC7787</a>] and includes a DNCP
   profile that defines transport and synchronization details for
   sharing state across nodes defined in <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>.  The rest of the
   document defines behavior of the services noted above, how the
   required TLVs are encoded (<a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>), as well as additional
   requirements on how HNCP nodes should behave (<a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Applicability"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Applicability</span>

   While HNCP does not deal with routing protocols directly (except
   potentially informing them about internal and external interfaces if
   classification specified in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a> is used), in homenet
   environments where multiple IPv6 source prefixes can be present,
   routing based on the source and destination address is necessary
   [<a href="rfc7368.html" title='"IPv6 Home Networking Architecture Principles"'>RFC7368</a>].  Ideally, the routing protocol is also zero configuration
   (e.g., no need to configure identifiers or metrics), although HNCP
   can also be used with a manually configured routing protocol.

   As HNCP uses DNCP as the actual state synchronization protocol, the
   applicability statement of DNCP applies here as well; HNCP should not
   be used for any data that changes rapidly and constantly.  If such
   data needs to be published in an HNCP network, 1) a more applicable
   protocol should be used for those portions, and 2) locators to a
   server of said protocol should be announced using HNCP instead.  An
   example for this is naming and service discovery (<a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>) for
   which HNCP only transports DNS server addresses and no actual per-
   name or per-service data of hosts.

   HNCP TLVs specified within this document, in steady state, stay
   constant, with one exception: as Delegated-Prefix TLVs
   (<a href="#section-10.2.1">Section 10.2.1</a>) do contain lifetimes, they force republishing of
   that data every time the valid or preferred lifetimes of prefixes are
   updated (significantly).  Therefore, it is desirable for ISPs to
   provide large enough valid and preferred lifetimes to avoid
   unnecessary HNCP state churn in homes, but even given non-cooperating
   ISPs, the state churn is proportional only to the number of
   externally received delegated prefixes and not to the home network
   size, and it should therefore be relatively low.

   HNCP assumes a certain level of control over host configuration
   servers (e.g., DHCP [<a href="rfc2131.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>]) on links that are managed by its
   routers.  Some HNCP functionality (such as border discovery or some
   aspects of naming) might be affected by existing DHCP servers that
   are not aware of the HNCP-managed network and thus might need to be
   reconfigured to not result in unexpected behavior.

   While HNCP routers can provide configuration to and receive
   configuration from non-HNCP routers, they are not able to traverse
   such devices based solely on the protocol as defined in this
   document, i.e., HNCP routers that are connected only by different
   interfaces of a non-HNCP router will not be part of the same HNCP
   network.

   While HNCP is designed to be used by (home) routers, it can also be
   used by advanced hosts that want to do, e.g., their own address
   assignment and routing.

   HNCP is link-layer agnostic; if a link supports IPv6 (link-local)
   multicast and unicast, HNCP will work on it.  Trickle retransmissions
   and keep-alives will handle both packet loss and non-transitive
   connectivity, ensuring eventual convergence.

                     categories mark the interface as out of or within
                     the network border; there are also a number of

   The DNCP profile for HNCP is defined as follows:

   o  HNCP uses UDP datagrams on port 8231 as a transport over link-
      local scoped IPv6, using unicast and multicast
      (FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:11 is the HNCP group address).  Received
      datagrams where either or both of the IPv6 source or destination
      addresses are not link-local scoped MUST be ignored.  Replies to
      multicast and unicast messages MUST be sent to the IPv6 source
      address and port of the original message.  Each node MUST be able
      to receive (and potentially reassemble) UDP datagrams with a
      payload of at least 4000 bytes.

   o  HNCP operates on multicast-capable interfaces only.  HNCP nodes
      MUST assign a non-zero 32-bit endpoint identifier to each
      interface for which HNCP is enabled.  The value 0 is not used in
      DNCP TLVs but has a special meaning in HNCP TLVs (see Sections <a href="#section-6.4">6.4</a>
      and 10.3).  These identifiers MUST be locally unique within the
      scope of the node, and using values equivalent to the IPv6 link-
      local scope identifiers for the given interfaces are RECOMMENDED.

   o  HNCP uses opaque 32-bit node identifiers
      (DNCP_NODE_IDENTIFIER_LENGTH = 32).  A node implementing HNCP
      SHOULD use a random node identifier.  If there is a node
      identifier collision (as specified in the Node-State TLV handling
      of <a href="rfc7787.html#section-4.4">Section 4.4 of [RFC7787]</a>), the node MUST immediately generate



<span class="grey">Stenberg, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 7]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-8" id="page-8" name="page-8"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7788.html">RFC 7788</a>            Home Networking Control Protocol          April 2016</span>


      and use a new random node identifier that is not used by any other
      node at the time, based on the current DNCP network state.

   o  HNCP nodes MUST use the leading 64 bits of the MD5 message digest
      [<a href="rfc1321.html" title='"The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm"'>RFC1321</a>] as the DNCP hash function H(x) used in building the DNCP
      hash tree.

   o  HNCP nodes MUST use DNCP's per-endpoint keep-alive extension on
      all endpoints.  The following parameters are suggested:

      *  Default keep-alive interval (DNCP_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL): 20
         seconds.

      *  Multiplier (DNCP_KEEPALIVE_MULTIPLIER): 2.1 on virtually
         lossless links works fine, as it allows for one lost keep-
         alive.  If used on a lossy link, a considerably higher
         multiplier, such as 15, should be used instead.  In that case,
         an implementation might prefer shorter keep-alive intervals on
         that link as well to ensure that the timeout (equal to
         DNCP_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL * DNCP_KEEPALIVE_MULTIPLIER) after
         which entirely lost nodes time out is low enough.

   o  HNCP nodes use the following Trickle parameters for the per-
      interface Trickle instances:

      *  k SHOULD be 1, as the timer reset when data is updated, and
         further retransmissions should handle packet loss.  Even on a
         non-transitive lossy link, the eventual per-endpoint keep-
         alives should ensure status synchronization occurs.

      *  Imin SHOULD be 200 milliseconds but MUST NOT be lower.  Note:
         earliest transmissions may occur at Imin / 2.

      *  Imax SHOULD be 7 doublings of Imin [<a href="rfc6206.html" title='"The Trickle Algorithm"'>RFC6206</a>] but MUST NOT be
         lower.

   o  HNCP unicast traffic SHOULD be secured using Datagram Transport
      Layer Security (DTLS) [<a href="rfc6347.html" title='"Datagram Transport Layer Security Version 1.2"'>RFC6347</a>] as described in DNCP if exchanged
      over unsecured links.  UDP on port 8232 is used for this purpose.
      A node implementing HNCP security MUST support the DNCP Pre-Shared
      Key (PSK) method, SHOULD support the PKI-based trust method, and
      MAY support the DNCP certificate-based trust consensus method.
      [<a href="rfc7525.html" title='"Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)"'>RFC7525</a>] provides guidance on how to securely utilize DTLS.

   o  HNCP nodes MUST ignore all Node-State TLVs received via multicast
      on a link that has DNCP security enabled in order to prevent
      spoofing of node state changes.

   Multiple versions of HNCP based on compatible DNCP profiles may be
   present in the same network when transitioning between HNCP versions,
   and for troubleshooting purposes, it might be beneficial to identify
   the HNCP agent version running.  Therefore, each node MUST include an
   HNCP-Version TLV (<a href="#section-10.1">Section 10.1</a>) indicating the currently supported
   version in its node data and MUST ignore (except for DNCP
   synchronization purposes) any TLVs that have a type greater than 32
   and that are published by nodes that didn't also publish an HNCP-
   Version TLV.

   HNCP routers may also have different capabilities regarding
   interactions with hosts, e.g., for configuration or service
   discovery.  These are indicated by M, P, H, and L values.  The
   combined "capability value" is a metric indicated by interpreting the
   bits as an integer, i.e., (M &lt;&lt; 12 | P &lt;&lt; 8 | H &lt;&lt; 4 | L).  These
   values are used to elect certain servers on a Common Link, as
   described in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>.  Nodes that are not routers MUST announce the
   value 0 for all capabilities.  Any node announcing the value 0 for a
   capability is considered to not advertise said capability and thus
   does not take part in the respective election.

   HNCP specifies the following categories that interfaces can be
   configured to be in:

   Internal category:  This declares an interface to be internal, i.e.,
      within the borders of the HNCP network.  The interface MUST
      operate as a DNCP endpoint.  Routers MUST forward traffic with
      appropriate source addresses between their internal interfaces and
      allow internal traffic to reach external networks.  All nodes MUST
      implement this category, and nodes not implementing any other
      category implicitly use it as a fixed default.

   External category:  This declares an interface to be external, i.e.,
      not within the borders of the HNCP network.  The interface MUST
      NOT operate as a DNCP endpoint.  Accessing internal resources from
      external interfaces is restricted, i.e., the use of Recommended
      Simple Security Capabilities in Customer Premises Equipments
      (CPEs) [<a href="rfc6092.html" title='"Recommended Simple Security Capabilities in Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) for Providing Residential IPv6 Internet Service"'>RFC6092</a>] is RECOMMENDED.  HNCP routers SHOULD announce
      acquired configuration information for use in the network as
      described in <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>, if the interface appears to be connected
      to an external network.  HNCP routers MUST implement this
      category.

   Leaf category:  This declares an interface used by client devices
      only.  Such an interface uses the Internal category with the
      exception that it MUST NOT operate as a DNCP endpoint.  This
      category SHOULD be supported by HNCP routers.

   Guest category:  This declares an interface used by untrusted client
      devices only.  In addition to the restrictions of the Leaf
      category, HNCP routers MUST filter traffic from and to the
      interface such that connected devices are unable to reach other
      devices inside the HNCP network or query services advertised by
      them unless explicitly allowed.  This category SHOULD be supported
      by HNCP routers.

   Ad Hoc category:  This configures an interface to use the Internal
      category, but no assumption is made about the link's transitivity.
      All other interface categories assume transitive connectivity.
      This affects the Common Link (<a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>) definition.  Support
      for this category is OPTIONAL.

   Hybrid category:  This declares an interface to use the Internal
      category while still trying to acquire (external) configuration
      information on it, e.g., by running DHCP clients.  This is useful,
      e.g., if the link is shared with a non-HNCP router under control
      and still within the borders of the same network.  Detection of
      this category automatically in addition to manual configuration is
      out of scope of this document.  Support for this category is

   Auto-detection of interface categories is possible based on
   interaction with DHCPv4 [<a href="rfc2131.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>] and DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
   (DHCPv6-PD) [<a href="rfc3633.html" title='"IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6"'>RFC3633</a>] servers on connected links.  HNCP defines
   special DHCP behavior to differentiate its internal servers from
   external ones in order to achieve this.  Therefore, all internal
   devices (including HNCP nodes) running DHCP servers on links where
   auto-detection is used by any HNCP node MUST use the following
   mechanism based on "The User Class Option for DHCP" [<a href="rfc3004.html" title='"The User Class Option for DHCP"'>RFC3004</a>] and its
   DHCPv6 counterpart [<a href="rfc3315.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)"'>RFC3315</a>]:

   o  The device MUST ignore or reject DHCP-Requests containing a DHCP
      user class consisting of the ASCII string "HOMENET".

   Not following this rule (e.g., running unmodified DHCP servers) might
   lead to false positives when auto-detection is used, i.e., HNCP nodes
   assume an interface to not be internal, even though it was intended
   to be.

   This section defines the interface classification algorithm.  It is
   suitable for both IPv4 and IPv6 (single or dual stack) and detects
   the category of an interface either automatically or based on a fixed
   configuration.  By determining the category for all interfaces, the
   network borders are implicitly defined, i.e., all interfaces not
   belonging to the External category are considered to be within the
   borders of the network; all others are not.

   The following algorithm MUST be implemented by any node implementing
   HNCP.  However, if the node does not implement auto-detection, only
   the first and last step are required.  The algorithm works as
   follows, with evaluation stopping at first match:

   1.  If a fixed category is configured for an interface, it is used.

   2.  If a delegated prefix could be acquired by running a DHCPv6
       client, it is considered external.  The DHCPv6 client MUST have
       included a DHCPv6 user class consisting of the ASCII string
       "HOMENET" in all of its requests.

   3.  If an IPv4 address could be acquired by running a DHCPv4 client
       on the interface, it is considered external.  The DHCPv4 client
       MUST have included a DHCP user class consisting of the ASCII
       string "HOMENET" in all of its requests.

   4.  The interface is considered internal.

   Note that as other HNCP nodes will ignore the client due to the User
   Class option, any server that replies is clearly external (or a
   malicious internal node).

   An HNCP router SHOULD allow setting the fixed category for each
   interface that may be connected to either an internal or external
   device (e.g., an Ethernet port that can be connected to a modem,
   another HNCP router, or a client).  Note that all fixed categories
   except internal and external cannot be auto-detected and can only be
   selected using manual configuration.

   An HNCP router using auto-detection on an interface MUST run the
   appropriately configured DHCP clients as long as the interface
   without a fixed category is active (including states where auto-
   detection considers it to be internal) and rerun the algorithm above
   to react to conditions resulting in a different interface category.
   The router SHOULD wait for a reasonable time period (5 seconds as a

   This section specifies how HNCP nodes configure host and node
   addresses.  At first, border routers share information obtained from
   service providers or local configuration by publishing one or more
   External-Connection TLVs (<a href="#section-10.2">Section 10.2</a>).  These contain other TLVs
   such as Delegated-Prefix TLVs (<a href="#section-10.2.1">Section 10.2.1</a>) that are then used for
   prefix assignment.  Finally, HNCP nodes obtain addresses either
   statelessly or using a specific stateful mechanism (<a href="#section-6.4">Section 6.4</a>).
   Hosts and non-HNCP routers are configured using SLAAC, DHCP, or
   DHCPv6-PD.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1.%20%20Common%20Link"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Common Link</span>

   HNCP uses the concept of Common Link both in autonomic address
   configuration and naming and service discovery (<a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>).  A Common
   Link refers to the set of interfaces of nodes that see each other's
   traffic and presumably also the traffic of all hosts that may use the
   nodes to, e.g., forward traffic.  Common Links are used, e.g., to
   determine where prefixes should be assigned or which peers
   participate in the election of a DHCP server.  The Common Link is
   computed separately for each local internal interface, and it always
   contains the local interface.  Additionally, if the local interface
   is not set to the Ad Hoc category (see <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>), it also contains
   the set of interfaces that are bidirectionally reachable from the
   given local interface; that is, every remote interface of a remote
   node meeting all of the following requirements:

   o  The local node publishes a Peer TLV with:

      *  Peer Node Identifier = remote node's node identifier

      *  Peer Endpoint Identifier = remote interface's endpoint
         identifier

      *  Endpoint Identifier = local interface's endpoint identifier

   o  The remote node publishes a Peer TLV with:

      *  Peer Node Identifier = local node's node identifier

      *  Peer Endpoint Identifier = local interface's endpoint
         identifier

      *  Endpoint Identifier = remote interface's endpoint identifier

   A node MUST be able to detect whether two of its local internal
   interfaces are connected, e.g., by detecting an identical remote
   interface being part of the Common Links of both local interfaces.

   Each HNCP router MAY obtain external connection information such as
   address prefixes, DNS server addresses, and DNS search paths from one
   or more sources, e.g., DHCPv6-PD [<a href="rfc3633.html" title='"IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6"'>RFC3633</a>], NETCONF [<a href="rfc6241.html" title='"Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)"'>RFC6241</a>], or
   static configuration.  Each individual external connection to be
   shared in the network is represented by one External-Connection TLV
   (<a href="#section-10.2">Section 10.2</a>).

   Announcements of individual external connections can consist of the
   following components:

   Delegated Prefixes:   Address space available for assignment to
      internal links announced using Delegated-Prefix TLVs
      (<a href="#section-10.2.1">Section 10.2.1</a>).  Some address spaces might have special
      properties that are necessary to understand in order to handle
      them (e.g., information similar to [<a href="rfc6603.html" title='"Prefix Exclude Option for DHCPv6-based Prefix Delegation"'>RFC6603</a>]).  This information
      is encoded using DHCPv6-Data TLVs (<a href="#section-10.2.2">Section 10.2.2</a>) inside the
      respective Delegated-Prefix TLVs.

   Auxiliary Information:   Information about services such as DNS or
      time synchronization regularly used by hosts in addition to
      addressing and routing information.  This information is encoded
      using DHCPv6-Data TLVs (<a href="#section-10.2.2">Section 10.2.2</a>) and DHCPv4-Data TLVs
      (<a href="#section-10.2.3">Section 10.2.3</a>).

   Whenever information about reserved parts (e.g., as specified in
   [<a href="rfc6603.html" title='"Prefix Exclude Option for DHCPv6-based Prefix Delegation"'>RFC6603</a>]) is received for a delegated prefix, the reserved parts
   MUST be advertised using Assigned-Prefix TLVs (<a href="#section-10.3">Section 10.3</a>) with the
   greatest priority (i.e., 15), as if they were assigned to a Private
   Link.

   Some connections or delegated prefixes may have a special meaning and
   are not regularly used for internal or Internet connectivity;
   instead, they may provide access to special services like VPNs,
   sensor networks, Voice over IP (VoIP), IPTV, etc.  Care must be taken
   that these prefixes are properly integrated and dealt with in the
   network, in order to avoid breaking connectivity for devices who are
   not aware of their special characteristics or to only selectively
   allow certain devices to use them.  Such prefixes are distinguished
   using Prefix-Policy TLVs (<a href="#section-10.2.1.1">Section 10.2.1.1</a>).  Their contents MAY be

   partly opaque to HNCP nodes, and their identification and usage
   depends on local policy.  However, the following general rules MUST
   be adhered to:

      Special rules apply when making address assignments for prefixes
      with Prefix-Policy TLVs with type 131, as described in
      <a href="#section-6.3.2">Section 6.3.2</a>.

      In the presence of any type 1 to 128 Prefix-Policy TLV, the prefix
      is specialized to reach destinations denoted by any such Prefix-
      Policy TLV, i.e., in absence of a type 0 Prefix-Policy TLV, it is
      not usable for general Internet connectivity.  An HNCP router MAY
      enforce this restriction with appropriate packet filter rules.

   HNCP uses the prefix assignment algorithm [<a href="rfc7695.html" title='"Distributed Prefix Assignment Algorithm"'>RFC7695</a>] in order to
   assign prefixes to HNCP internal links and uses some of the
   terminology (<a href="#section-2">Section 2</a>) defined there.  HNCP furthermore defines the
   Assigned-Prefix TLV (<a href="#section-10.3">Section 10.3</a>), which MUST be used to announce
   Published Assigned Prefixes.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.3.1.%20%20Prefix%20Assignment%20Algorithm%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.3.1" name="section-6.3.1">6.3.1</a>.  Prefix Assignment Algorithm Parameters</span>

   All HNCP nodes running the prefix assignment algorithm use the
   following values for its parameters:

   Node IDs:   HNCP node identifiers are used.  The comparison operation
      is defined as bitwise comparison.

   Set of Delegated Prefixes:   The set of prefixes encoded in
      Delegated-Prefix TLVs that are not strictly included in prefixes
      encoded in other Delegated-Prefix TLVs.  Note that Delegated-
      Prefix TLVs included in ignored External-Connection TLVs are not
      considered.  It is dynamically updated as Delegated-Prefix TLVs
      are added or removed.

   Set of Shared Links:   The set of Common Links associated with
      interfaces with the Internal, Leaf, Guest, or Ad Hoc category.  It
      is dynamically updated as interfaces are added, removed, or
      switched from one category to another.  When multiple interfaces
      are detected as belonging to the same Common Link, prefix
      assignment is disabled on all of these interfaces except one.

   Set of Private Links:   This document defines Private Links as
      representing DHCPv6-PD clients or as a mean to advertise prefixes
      included in the DHCPv6 Exclude Prefix option.  Other
      implementation-specific Private Links may be defined whenever a
      prefix needs to be assigned for a purpose that does not require a
      consensus with other HNCP nodes.

   Set of Advertised Prefixes:   The set of prefixes included in
      Assigned-Prefix TLVs advertised by other HNCP nodes (prefixes
      advertised by the local node are not in this set).  The associated
      Advertised Prefix Priority is the priority specified in the TLV.
      The associated Shared Link is determined as follows:

      *  If the Link Identifier is 0, the Advertised Prefix is not
         assigned on a Shared Link.

      *  If the other node's interface identified by the Link Identifier
         is included in one of the Common Links used for prefix
         assignment, it is considered as assigned on the given Common
         Link.

      *  Otherwise, the Advertised Prefix is not assigned on a Shared
         Link.

      Advertised Prefixes as well as their associated priorities and
      associated Shared Links MUST be updated as Assigned-Prefix TLVs
      are added, updated, or removed, and as Common Links are modified.

   ADOPT_MAX_DELAY:   The default value is 0 seconds (i.e., prefix
      adoption is done instantly).

   BACKOFF_MAX_DELAY:   The default value is 4 seconds.

   RANDOM_SET_SIZE:   The default value is 64.

   Flooding Delay:   The default value is 5 seconds.

   Default Advertised Prefix Priority:   When a new assignment is
      created or an assignment is adopted -- as specified in the prefix
      assignment algorithm routine -- the default Advertised Prefix
      Priority to be used is 2.

   Whenever the prefix assignment algorithm subroutine (<a href="rfc7695.html#section-4.1">Section 4.1 of
   [RFC7695]</a>) is run on a Common Link, and whenever a new prefix may be
   assigned (case 1 of the subroutine: no Best Assignment and no Current
   Assignment), the decision of whether the assignment of a new prefix
   is desired MUST follow these rules in order:

      If the Delegated-Prefix TLV contains a DHCPv6-Data TLV, and the
      meaning of one of the DHCP options is not understood by the HNCP
      node, the creation of a new prefix is not desired.  This rule
      applies to TLVs inside Delegated-Prefix TLVs but not to those
      inside External-Connection TLVs.

      If the remaining preferred lifetime of the prefix is 0 and there
      is another delegated prefix of the same IP version used for prefix
      assignment with a non-zero preferred lifetime, the creation of a
      new prefix is not desired.

      If the Delegated-Prefix TLV does not include a Prefix-Policy TLV
      indicating restrictive assignment (type 131) or if local policy
      exists to identify it based on, e.g., other Prefix-Policy TLV
      values and allows assignment, the creation of a new prefix is
      desired.

      Otherwise, the creation of a new prefix is not desired.

   If the considered delegated prefix is an IPv6 prefix, and whenever
   there is at least one available prefix of length 64, a prefix of
   length 64 MUST be selected unless configured otherwise.  In case no
   prefix of length 64 would be available, a longer prefix MAY be
   selected even without configuration.

   If the considered delegated prefix is an IPv4 prefix (<a href="#section-6.5">Section 6.5</a>
   details how IPv4-delegated prefixes are generated), a prefix of
   length 24 SHOULD be preferred.

   In any case, an HNCP router making an assignment MUST support a
   mechanism suitable to distribute addresses from the considered prefix
   if the link is intended to be used by clients.  In this case, a
   router assigning an IPv4 prefix MUST announce the L-capability, and a
   router assigning an IPv6 prefix with a length greater than 64 MUST
   announce the H-capability as defined in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   The prefix assignment algorithm indicates when a prefix is applied to
   the respective Common Link.  When that happens, each router connected
   to said link:

      MUST forward traffic destined to said prefix to the respective
      link.

      MUST participate in the client configuration election as described
      in <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>, if the link is intended to be used by clients.

      MAY add an address from said prefix to the respective network
      interface as described in <a href="#section-6.4">Section 6.4</a>, e.g., if it is to be used
      as source for locally originating traffic.

   When an HNCP router announcing the P-Capability (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>) receives
   a DHCPv6-PD request from a client, it SHOULD assign one prefix per
   delegated prefix in the network.  This set of assigned prefixes is
   then delegated to the client, after it has been applied as described
   in the prefix assignment algorithm.  Each DHCPv6-PD client MUST be
   considered as an independent Private Link, and delegation MUST be
   based on the same set of delegated prefixes as the one used for
   Common Link prefix assignments; however, the prefix length to be
   delegated MAY be smaller than 64.

   The assigned prefixes MUST NOT be given to DHCPv6-PD clients before
   they are applied and MUST be withdrawn whenever they are destroyed.
   As an exception to this rule, in order to shorten delays of processed
   requests, a router MAY prematurely give out a prefix that is
   advertised but not yet applied if it does so with a valid lifetime of
   not more than 30 seconds and ensures removal or correction of
   lifetimes as soon as possible.

   This section specifies how HNCP nodes reserve addresses for their own
   use.  Nodes MAY, at any time, try to reserve a new address from any
   Applied Assigned Prefix.  Each HNCP node SHOULD announce an IPv6
   address and -- if it supports IPv4 -- MUST announce an IPv4 address,
   whenever matching prefixes are assigned to at least one of its Common
   Links.  These addresses are published using Node-Address TLVs and
   used to locally reach HNCP nodes for other services.  Nodes SHOULD
   NOT create and announce more than one assignment per IP version to
   avoid cluttering the node data with redundant information unless a
   special use case requires it.

   Stateless assignment based on Semantically Opaque Interface
   Identifiers [<a href="rfc7217.html" title='"A Method for Generating Semantically Opaque Interface Identifiers with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)"'>RFC7217</a>] SHOULD be used for address assignment whenever
   possible (e.g., the prefix length is 64), otherwise (e.g., for IPv4
   if supported) the following method MUST be used instead: For any
   assigned prefix for which stateless assignment is not used, the first
   quarter of the addresses are reserved for HNCP-based address
   assignments, whereas the last three quarters are left to the DHCP
   elected router (<a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> specifies the DHCP server election
   process).  For example, if the prefix 192.0.2.0/24 is assigned and
   applied to a Common Link, addresses included in 192.0.2.0/26 are
   reserved for HNCP nodes, and the remaining addresses are reserved for
   the elected DHCPv4 server.

   HNCP nodes assign addresses to themselves and then (to ensure
   eventual lack of conflicting assignments) publish the assignments
   using the Node-Address TLV (<a href="#section-10.4">Section 10.4</a>).

   The process of obtaining addresses is specified as follows:

   o  A node MUST NOT start advertising an address if it is already
      advertised by another node.

   o  An assigned address MUST be part of an assigned prefix currently
      applied on a Common Link that includes the interface specified by
      the endpoint identifier.

   o  An address MUST NOT be used unless it has been advertised for at
      least ADDRESS_APPLY_DELAY consecutive seconds and is still
      currently being advertised.  The default value for
      ADDRESS_APPLY_DELAY is 3 seconds.

   o  Whenever the same address is advertised by more than one node, all
      but the one advertised by the node with the greatest node
      identifier MUST be removed.

   HNCP routers can create a Unique Local Address (ULA) or private IPv4

   are inserted in HNCP as if they were delegated prefixes of a
   (virtual) external connection (<a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>).  The following rules
   apply:

      An HNCP router SHOULD create a ULA prefix if there is no other

      prefixes are present, only the one published by the node with the
      greatest node identifier is kept among those with a preferred time
      greater than 0 -- if there is any.

      An HNCP router MUST create a private IPv4 prefix [<a href="rfc1918.html" title='"Address Allocation for Private Internets"'>RFC1918</a>]
      whenever it wishes to provide IPv4 Internet connectivity to the
      network and no other private IPv4 prefix with Internet
      connectivity currently exists.  It MAY also enable local IPv4
      connectivity by creating a private IPv4 prefix if no IPv4 prefix
      exists but MUST NOT do so otherwise.  In case multiple IPv4
      prefixes are announced, only the one published by the node with
      the greatest node identifier is kept among those with a Prefix-
      Policy TLV of type 0 -- if there is any.  The router publishing a
      prefix with Internet connectivity MUST forward IPv4 traffic to the
      Internet and perform NAT on behalf of the network as long as it
      publishes the prefix; other routers in the network MAY choose not
      to.

   Creation of such ULA and IPv4 prefixes MUST be delayed by a random
   time span between 0 and 10 seconds in which the router MUST scan for
   others trying to do the same.

   When a new ULA prefix is created, the prefix is selected based on the
   configuration, using the last non-deprecated ULA prefix, or generated
   based on [<a href="rfc4193.html" title='"Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses"'>RFC4193</a>].

   HNCP routers need to ensure that hosts and non-HNCP downstream
   routers on internal links are configured with addresses and routes.
   Since DHCP clients can usually only bind to one server at a time, a
   per-link and per-service election takes place.

   HNCP routers may have different capabilities for configuring
   downstream devices and providing naming services.  Each router MUST
   therefore indicate its capabilities as specified in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> in
   order to participate as a candidate in the election.

   In general, Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [<a href="rfc4861.html" title='"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)"'>RFC4861</a>] is used for
   client configuration for its low overhead and fast renumbering
   capabilities.  Therefore, each HNCP router sends Router
   Advertisements on interfaces that are intended to be used by clients
   and MUST at least include a Prefix Information Option for each
   Applied Assigned Prefix that it assigned to the respective link in
   every such advertisement.  However, stateful DHCPv6 can be used in

   handing out leases from locally generated (ULA) prefixes and prefixes
   with a length different from 64 and by using low renew and rebind
   times (i.e., not longer than 5 minutes).  In case no router was
   elected, stateful DHCPv6 is not provided.  Routers that cease to be
   elected DHCP servers SHOULD -- when applicable -- invalidate
   remaining existing bindings in order to trigger client
   reconfiguration.

   Network-wide naming and service discovery can greatly improve the
   user friendliness of a network.  The following mechanism provides
   means to setup and delegate naming and service discovery across
   multiple HNCP routers.

   Each HNCP router SHOULD provide and advertise a recursive name
   resolving server to clients that honor the announcements made in
   Delegated-Zone TLVs (<a href="#section-10.5">Section 10.5</a>), Domain-Name TLVs (<a href="#section-10.6">Section 10.6</a>),
   and Node-Name TLVs (<a href="#section-10.7">Section 10.7</a>), i.e., delegate queries to the
   designated name servers and hand out appropriate A, AAAA, and PTR
   records according to the mentioned TLVs.

   Each HNCP router SHOULD provide and announce an auto-generated or
   user-configured name for each internal Common Link (<a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>) for
   which it is the designated DHCPv4, stateful DHCPv6 server, mDNS
   proxy, or for which it provides forward or reverse DNS services on
   behalf of connected devices.  This announcement is done using
   Delegated-Zone TLVs (<a href="#section-10.5">Section 10.5</a>) and MUST be unique in the whole
   network.  In case of a conflict, the announcement of the node with
   the greatest node identifier takes precedence, and all other nodes
   MUST cease to announce the conflicting TLV.  HNCP routers providing
   recursive name resolving services MUST use the included DNS server



<span class="grey">Stenberg, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 21]</span></pre>

   address within the TLV to resolve names belonging to the zone as if
   there was an NS record.

   Each HNCP node SHOULD announce a node name for itself to be easily
   reachable and MAY announce names on behalf of other devices.
   Announcements are made using Node-Name TLVs (<a href="#section-10.7">Section 10.7</a>), and the
   announced names MUST be unique in the whole network.  In case of a
   conflict, the announcement of the node with the greatest node
   identifier takes precedence, and all other nodes MUST cease to
   announce the conflicting TLV.  HNCP routers providing recursive name
   resolving services as described above MUST resolve such announced
   names to their respective IP addresses as if there were corresponding
   A/AAAA records.

   Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide
   naming and service discovery with local significance.  A network-wide
   zone is appended to all single labels or unqualified zones in order
   to qualify them. ".home" is the default; however, an administrator
   MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV (<a href="#section-10.6">Section 10.6</a>)
   for the network to use a different one.  In case multiple are
   announced, the domain of the node with the greatest node identifier
   takes precedence.

   PSKs are often required to secure (for example) IGPs and other
   protocols that lack support for asymmetric security.  The following
   mechanism manages PSKs using HNCP to enable bootstrapping of such
   third-party protocols.  The scheme SHOULD NOT be used unless it's in
   conjunction with secured HNCP unicast transport (i.e., DTLS), as
   transferring the PSK in plaintext anywhere in the network is a
   potential risk, especially as the originator may not know about
   security (and use of DNCP security) on all links.  The following
   rules define how such a PSK is managed and used:

   o  If no Managed-PSK TLV (<a href="#section-10.8">Section 10.8</a>) is currently being announced,
      an HNCP node using this mechanism MUST create one after a random
      delay of 0 to 10 seconds with a 32 bytes long random key and add
      it to its node data.

   o  In case multiple nodes announce such a TLV at the same time, all
      but the one with the greatest node identifier stop advertising it
      and adopt the remaining one.

   o  The node currently advertising the Managed-PSK TLV MUST generate
      and advertise a new random one whenever an unreachable node is
      removed from the DNCP topology as described in <a href="rfc7787.html#section-4.6">Section 4.6 of
      [RFC7787]</a>.

   PSKs for individual protocols SHOULD be derived from the random PSK
   using a suitable one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., by using the HMAC-
   based Key Derivation Function (HKDF) based on HMAC-SHA256 [<a href="rfc6234.html" title='"US Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA and SHA-based HMAC and HKDF)"'>RFC6234</a>]
   with the particular protocol name in the info field) so that
   disclosure of any derived key does not impact other users of the
   managed PSK.  Furthermore, derived PSKs MUST be updated whenever the
   managed PSK changes.

   HNCP defines the following TLVs in addition to those defined by DNCP.
   The same general rules and defaults for encoding as noted in
   <a href="rfc7787.html#section-7">Section 7 of [RFC7787]</a> apply.  Note that most HNCP variable-length
   TLVs also support optional nested TLVs, and they are encoded after
   the variable-length content, followed by the zero padding of the
   variable-length content to the next 32-bit boundary.

   TLVs defined here are only valid when appearing in their designated
   context, i.e., only directly within container TLVs mentioned in their
   definition or -- absent any mentions -- only as top-level TLVs within
   the node data set.  TLVs appearing outside their designated context
   MUST be ignored.

   TLVs encoding IP addresses or prefixes allow encoding both IPv6 and
   IPv4 addresses and prefixes.  IPv6 information is encoded as is,
   whereas for IPv4, the IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses format [<a href="rfc4291.html" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>RFC4291</a>] is
   used, and prefix lengths are encoded as the original IPv4 prefix
   length increased by 96.

   The Prefix-Policy TLV contains information about the policy or
   applicability of a delegated prefix.  This information can be used to
   determine whether prefixes for a certain use case (e.g., local
   reachability, Internet connectivity) do exist or are to be acquired
   and to make decisions about assigning prefixes to certain links or to
   fine-tune border firewalls.  See <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a> for a more in-depth
   discussion.  This TLV is only valid inside a Delegated-Prefix TLV.

   Policy Type:   The type of the policy identifier.

   This TLV is used to announce a forward or reverse DNS zone delegation
   in the HNCP network.  Its meaning is roughly equivalent to specifying
   an NS and A/AAAA record for said zone.  Details are specified in
   <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.

   IP Address:  The IPv6 address of the authoritative DNS server for the
      zone; IPv4 addresses are represented as IPv4-mapped addresses
      [<a href="rfc4291.html" title='"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture"'>RFC4291</a>].  The special value of :: (all zeros) means the
      delegation is available in the global DNS hierarchy.

   Reserved:  Those bits MUST be set to 0 when creating the TLV and
      ignored when parsing it unless defined in a later specification.

   L-bit:  (DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) [<a href="rfc6763.html" title='"DNS-Based Service Discovery"'>RFC6763</a>] Legacy-
      Browse) indicates that this delegated zone SHOULD be included in
      the network's DNS-SD legacy browse list of domains at
      lb._dns-sd._udp.(DOMAIN-NAME).  Local forward zones SHOULD have
      this bit set; reverse zones SHOULD NOT.

   B-bit:  (DNS-SD [<a href="rfc6763.html" title='"DNS-Based Service Discovery"'>RFC6763</a>] Browse) indicates that this delegated zone
      SHOULD be included in the network's DNS-SD browse list of domains
      at b._dns-sd._udp.(DOMAIN-NAME).  Local forward zones SHOULD have
      this bit set; reverse zones SHOULD NOT.

   S-bit:  (Fully qualified DNS-SD [<a href="rfc6763.html" title='"DNS-Based Service Discovery"'>RFC6763</a>] domain) indicates that this
      delegated zone consists of a fully qualified DNS-SD domain, which
      should be used as the base for DNS-SD domain enumeration, i.e.,

      DHCPv4.

   o  It SHOULD be able to delegate prefixes to legacy IPv6 routers
      using DHCPv6-PD (<a href="#section-6.3.4">Section 6.3.4</a>).

   o  In addition, the normative language of "Basic Requirements for
      IPv6 Customer Edge Routers" [<a href="rfc7084.html" title='"Basic Requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers"'>RFC7084</a>] applies with the following
      adjustments:

      *  The generic requirements G-4 and G-5 are relaxed such that any
         known default router on any interface is sufficient for a
         router to announce itself as the default router; similarly,
         only the loss of all such default routers results in self-
         invalidation.

      *  "WAN-Side Configuration" (<a href="#section-4.2">Section 4.2</a>) applies to interfaces
         classified as external.

      *  If the Customer Edge (CE) sends a size hint as indicated in
         WPD-2, the hint MUST NOT be determined by the number of LAN
         interfaces of the CE but SHOULD instead be large enough to at
         least accommodate prefix assignments announced for existing
         delegated or ULA prefixes, if such prefixes exist and unless
         explicitly configured otherwise.

      *  The dropping of packets with a destination address belonging to
         a delegated prefix mandated in WPD-5 MUST NOT be applied to
         destinations that are part of any prefix announced using an
         Assigned-Prefix TLV by any HNCP router in the network.

      *  "LAN-Side Configuration" (<a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>) applies to interfaces
         not classified as external.

      *  The requirement L-2 to assign a separate /64 to each LAN
         interface is replaced by the participation in the prefix
         assignment mechanism (<a href="#section-6.3">Section 6.3</a>) for each such interface.

      *  The requirement L-9 is modified, in that the M flag MUST be set
         if and only if a router connected to the respective Common Link
         is advertising a non-zero H-capability.  The O flag SHOULD
         always be set.

      *  The requirement L-12 to make DHCPv6 options available is
         adapted, in that Canonical Encoding Rules (CER) SHOULD publish
         the subset of options using the DHCPv6-Data TLV in an External-
         Connection TLV.  Similarly, it SHOULD do the same for DHCPv4
         options in a DHCPv4-Data TLV.  DHCPv6 options received inside

         HNCP routers SHOULD make relevant DHCPv6 and DHCPv4 options
         available to clients, i.e., options contained in External-
         Connection TLVs that also include delegated prefixes from which
         a subset is assigned to the respective link.

      *  The requirement L-13 to deprecate prefixes is applied to all
         delegated prefixes in the network from which assignments have
         been made on the respective interface.  Furthermore, the Prefix
         Information Options indicating deprecation MUST be included in

   HNCP enables self-configuring networks, requiring as little user
   intervention as possible.  However, this zero-configuration goal
   usually conflicts with security goals and introduces a number of
   threats.

   General security issues for existing home networks are discussed in
   [<a href="rfc7368.html" title='"IPv6 Home Networking Architecture Principles"'>RFC7368</a>].  The protocols used to set up addresses and routes in such
   networks to this day rarely have security enabled within the
   configuration protocol itself.  However, these issues are out of
   scope for the security of HNCP itself.

   HNCP is a DNCP-based state synchronization mechanism carrying
   information with varying threat potential.  For this consideration,
   the payloads defined in DNCP and this document are reviewed:

   o  Network topology information such as HNCP nodes and their common
      links.

   o  Address assignment information such as delegated and assigned
      prefixes for individual links.

   o  Naming and service discovery information such as auto-generated or
      customized names for individual links and nodes.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.1.%20%20Interface%20Classification"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.1" name="section-12.1">12.1</a>.  Interface Classification</span>

   As described in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>, an HNCP node determines the internal or
   external state on a per-interface basis.  A firewall perimeter is set
   up for the external interfaces, and for internal interfaces, HNCP
   traffic is allowed, with the exception of the Leaf and Guest
   subcategories.



<span class="grey">Stenberg, et al.             Standards Track                   [Page 34]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-35" id="page-35" name="page-35"> </a>

   Threats concerning automatic interface classification cannot be
   mitigated by encrypting or authenticating HNCP traffic itself since
   external routers do not participate in the protocol and often cannot
   be authenticated by other means.  These threats include propagation
   of forged uplinks in the homenet in order to, e.g., redirect traffic
   destined to external locations and forged internal status by external
   routers to, e.g., circumvent the perimeter firewall.

   It is therefore imperative to either secure individual links on the
   physical or link layer or preconfigure the adjacent interfaces of
   HNCP routers to an appropriate fixed category in order to secure the
   homenet border.  Depending on the security of the external link,
   eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, and similar attacks on external
   traffic can still happen between a homenet border router and the ISP;
   however, these cannot be mitigated from inside the homenet.  For
   example, DHCPv4 has defined [<a href="rfc3118.html" title='"Authentication for DHCP Messages"'>RFC3118</a>] to authenticate DHCPv4
   messages, but this is very rarely implemented in large or small
   networks.  Further, while PPP can provide secure authentication of
   both sides of a point-to-point link, it is most often deployed with
   one-way authentication of the subscriber to the ISP, not the ISP to
   the subscriber.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.2.%20%20Security%20of%20Unicast%20Traffic"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.2" name="section-12.2">12.2</a>.  Security of Unicast Traffic</span>

   Once the homenet border has been established, there are several ways
   to secure HNCP against internal threats like manipulation or
   eavesdropping by compromised devices on a link that is enabled for
   HNCP traffic.  If left unsecured, attackers may perform arbitrary
   traffic redirection, eavesdropping, spoofing, or denial-of-service
   attacks on HNCP services such as address assignment or service
   discovery, and the protocols are secured using HNCP-derived keys such
   as routing protocols.

   Detailed interface categories like "Leaf" or "Guest" can be used to
   integrate not fully trusted devices to various degrees into the
   homenet by not exposing them to HNCP traffic or by using firewall
   rules to prevent them from reaching homenet-internal resources.

   On links where this is not practical and lower layers do not provide
   adequate protection from attackers, DTLS-based secure unicast
   transport MUST be used to secure traffic.

   IGPs and other protocols are usually run alongside HNCP; therefore,
   the individual security aspects of the respective protocols must be
   considered.  It can, however, be summarized that many protocols to be
   run in the home (like IGPs) provide -- to a certain extent -- similar

   security mechanisms.  Most of these protocols do not support
   encryption and only support authentication based on Pre-Shared Keys
   natively.  This influences the effectiveness of any encryption-based
   security mechanism deployed by HNCP as homenet routing information is
   thus usually not encrypted.
