Abstract

   The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) specification describes a key
   management scheme for real-time applications.  In this document, we
   note that the currently defined MIKEY modes are insufficient to
   address deployment scenarios built around a centralized key
   management service.  Interest in such deployments is increasing.
   Therefore, a set of new MIKEY modes that work well in such scenarios
   are defined.  The new modes use a trusted key management service and
   a ticket concept, similar to that in Kerberos.  The new modes also
   support features used by many existing applications, where the exact
   identity of the other endpoint may not be known at the start of the
   communication session.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Key management systems are either based on negotiation and exchange
   directly between peers (e.g., Diffie-Hellman-based schemes), pre-
   distribution of user credentials (shared secrets/certificates), or
   availability of a trusted Key Management Service (KMS).  The modes
   described in the Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) specification
   [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>] and its extensions [<a href="rfc4650.html" title='"HMAC-Authenticated Diffie-Hellman for Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)"'>RFC4650</a>] [<a href="rfc4738.html" title='"MIKEY-RSA-R: An Additional Mode of Key Distribution in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)"'>RFC4738</a>] are all variants of
   the first two alternatives.

   In security systems serving a large number of users, a solution based
   on a key management service is often preferred.  With such a service
   in place, there is no need to pre-distribute credentials that
   directly can be used to establish security associations between peers
   for protected communication, as users can request such credentials
   when needed.  Solutions based on a trusted key management service
   also scale well when the number of users grows.

   This document introduces a set of new MIKEY modes that go under the
   common name MIKEY-TICKET.  The new modes support a ticket concept,
   similar to that in Kerberos [<a href="rfc4120.html" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>], which is used to identify and
   deliver keys.  A high-level outline of MIKEY-TICKET as defined herein
   is that the Initiator requests keys and a ticket from the KMS and
   sends the ticket to the Responder.  The ticket contains a reference
   to the keys, or the enveloped keys.  The Responder then sends the
   ticket to the KMS, which returns the appropriate keys.

   MIKEY-TICKET is primarily designed to be used for media plane
   security in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IP
   Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) [<a href="#ref-3GPP.33.328" title='"IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) media plane security"'>3GPP.33.328</a>].  This implies that some
   extensions to the basic Kerberos concept are needed.  For instance,
   the Initiator may not always know the exact identity of the Responder
   when the communication with the key management server is initiated.

   This document defines a signaling framework enabling peers to
   request, transfer, and resolve various Ticket Types using a key
   management service.  A default Ticket Type is also defined.  To allow
   the use of 256-bit keys for users with high security requirements,
   additional encryption, authentication, and pseudorandom functions are
   defined.  And to eliminate the limitations with the existing SRTP-ID
   map type, a new CS ID map type called GENERIC-ID is defined.

   As mentioned in the introduction, none of the previously defined
   MIKEY modes are based on a KMS.  The pre-shared key method and the
   public-key encryption method defined in [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>] are examples of
   systems based on pre-distribution of user credentials.  The Diffie-
   Hellman method [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>] is an example of a system based on
   negotiation and exchange directly between peers.

   In some situations, a request may be delivered to multiple endpoints.
   The endpoints may be multiple devices owned by a single user (e.g.,
   mobile phone, fixed phone, and computer), or multiple users (e.g.,
   IT-support@example.com, a group of users where only one is supposed
   to answer).  In the following, the term "forking" will be used to
   describe all such cases.  One example of delivery to multiple
   endpoints is forking and retargeting in SIP [<a href="rfc3261.html" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>RFC3261</a>].  To prevent
   any form of eavesdropping, only the endpoint that answers should get
   access to the session keys.  The naive application of [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>] where
   all endpoints share the same pre-shared/private key is not secure
   when it comes to forking, as all endpoints get access to the session
   keys.  Conversely, having per-user unique pre-shared keys/
   certificates creates more fundamental problems with forking, as the
   initiator does not know which pre-shared key/certificate to use at
   session initiation.  SIP-signaled media protection is described in
   [<a href="rfc5479.html" title='"Requirements and Analysis of Media Security Management Protocols"'>RFC5479</a>] and the applicability of different MIKEY modes is discussed
   in [<a href="rfc5197.html" title='"On the Applicability of Various Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) Modes and Extensions"'>RFC5197</a>].

   In security systems serving a large number of users, a solution based
   on a key management service is often preferred.  With such a service
   in place, there is no need to pre-distribute credentials that
   directly can be used to establish security associations between peers
   for protected communication, as users can request such credentials
   when needed.  In many applications, e.g., National Security and
   Public Safety (NSPS), the controlling organization wants to enforce
   policies on the use of keys.  A trusted KMS fits these applications
   well, as it makes it easier to enforce policies centrally.  Solutions
   based on a trusted KMS also scale well when the number of users
   grows.  A KMS based on symmetric keys has particular advantages, as
   symmetric key algorithms are generally much less computationally
   intensive than asymmetric key algorithms.

   Systems based on a KMS require a signaling mechanism that allows
   peers to retrieve other peers' credentials.  A convenient way to
   implement such a signaling scheme is to use a ticket concept, similar
   to that in Kerberos [<a href="rfc4120.html" title='"The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)"'>RFC4120</a>] to identify and deliver keys.  The
   ticket can be forwarded in the signaling associated with the session
   setup.  The initiator requests a ticket from the KMS and sends the
   ticket to the responder.  The responder forwards the ticket to the
   KMS, which returns the corresponding keys.

   It should be noted that Kerberos does not require that the responder
   also contact the KMS.  However, in order to support also the
   aforementioned forking scenarios, it becomes necessary that the
   ticket is not bound to the exact identity (or credentials) of the
   responder until the final responder becomes fully determined.  Group
   and forking communication scenarios can also be improved from access
   control point of view if authorization to access the keys can be
   enforced with higher granularity at the responder side.  The
   mechanism specified in this document is useful for any system where
   the initial message may be transferred to arbitrarily many potential
   responders and where the set of responders may change at any time.
   In addition to being able to meet the requirements just described,
   the mechanism specified in this document also supports group key
   management.

   The ticket can contain a reference to keys held by the key management
   system or it can hold the keys itself.  In the latter case, the
   ticket needs to be confidentiality and integrity protected
   (enveloped).  In the following, the term "encoded keys" will be used
   to describe both cases as well as keys derived from such keys.

   By using different Ticket Types and ticket policies, some allowing
   the initiator or responder to create or resolve the tickets without
   assistance from the KMS, a wide range of different security levels




<span class="grey">Mattsson &amp; Tian               Informational                     [Page 8]</span></pre>

   and use cases can be supported.  This has a number of advantages, as
   it offers a framework that is flexible enough to satisfy users with a
   broad range of security and functional needs.

   The use of a ticket-based system may also help in the handling of
   keys for deferred delivery of end-to-end protected content to
   currently offline users.  Such scenarios exclude all key management
   schemes that are based on some type of direct online negotiation
   between peers (e.g., Diffie-Hellman-based schemes) as the responder
   cannot rely on contacting the initiator to get access to keys.

   At the same time, it is also important to be aware that (centralized)
   key management services may introduce a single point of (security)
   failure.  The security requirements on the implementation and
   protection of the KMS may therefore, in high-security applications,
   be more or less equivalent to the requirements of an AAA
   (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) server or a
   Certification Authority (CA).

   All previously defined MIKEY modes consist of a single (or half)
   round trip between two peers.  MIKEY-TICKET differs from these modes
   as it consists of up to three different round trips (Ticket Request,
   Ticket Transfer, and Ticket Resolve) involving three parties
   (Initiator, Responder, and KMS).  Since the number of round trips and
   order of messages may vary, MIKEY-TICKET is actually the common name
   for a set of modes, all revolving around a ticket concept.  The third
   party, the KMS, is only involved in some of the MIKEY exchanges and
   not at all in the resulting secure media session.  The Ticket Request
   and Ticket Resolve exchanges are meant to be used in combination with
   the Ticket Transfer exchange and not on their own.  In Figure 1, the
   signaling for the full three round-trip MIKEY-TICKET mode is
   depicted.

   The Initiator (I) wants to establish a secure media session with the
   Responder (R).  The Initiator and the Responder do not share any
   credentials; instead, they trust a third party, the KMS, with which
   they both have or can establish shared credentials.  These pre-
   established trust relations are used to establish a security
   association between I and R.  The assumed trust model is illustrated
   in Figure 2.

   Note that rather than a single KMS, multiple KMSs may be involved,
   e.g., one for the Initiator and one for the Responder; this is
   discussed in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.

   The Initiator requests keys and a ticket (encoding the same keys)
   from the KMS by sending a REQUEST_INIT message.  The REQUEST_INIT
   message includes session information (e.g., identities of the
   authorized responders) and is integrity protected by a MAC based on a
   pre-shared key or by a signature (similar to the pre-shared key and
   public-key encryption modes in [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>]).  If the request is
   authorized, the KMS generates the requested keys, encodes them in a
   ticket, and returns the keys and the ticket in a REQUEST_RESP

   The Initiator next includes the ticket in a TRANSFER_INIT message,
   which is sent to the Responder.  The TRANSFER_INIT message is
   protected by a MAC based on an MPK (MIKEY Protection Key) encoded in
   the ticket.  If the Responder finds the Ticket Policy and session
   security policies acceptable, the Responder forwards the ticket to
   the KMS.  This is done with a RESOLVE_INIT message, which asks the
   KMS to return the keys encoded in the ticket.  The RESOLVE_INIT
   message is protected by a MAC based on a pre-shared key (between
   Responder and KMS) or by a signature.  The Ticket Resolve exchange is
   OPTIONAL (depending on the Ticket Policy), and SHOULD only be used
   when the Responder is unable to resolve the ticket without assistance
   from the KMS (see mode 2 of <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>).

   The KMS resolves the ticket.  If the Responder is authorized to
   receive the keys encoded in the ticket, the KMS retrieves the keys
   and other information.  If key forking is used, the keys are modified
   (bound to the Responder) by the KMS, see <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a>.  The keys and
   additional information are then sent in a RESOLVE_RESP message to the
   Responder.  The Responder then sends a TRANSFER_RESP message to the
   Initiator as verification.  The TRANSFER_RESP message might include
   information used for further key derivation.

   The use case and signaling described above is the full three round-
   trip mode, but other modes are allowed, see <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>.  Pre-
   encrypted content is discussed in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>, group communication is
   discussed in <a href="#section-9">Section 9</a>, and signaling between different KMSs is
   discussed in <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.  An alternative use case is discussed in
   <a href="#appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.

   The session keys are normally generated/supplied by the KMS (encoded
   in the ticket), but in certain use cases (see <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>) the session
   key may be supplied by the Initiator or Responder (sent in a separate
   KEMAC protected with keys derived from the MPK).

   MIKEY-TICKET offers a framework that is flexible enough to satisfy
   users with a broad range of security and functional needs.  The
   framework consists of the three exchanges for which different Ticket
   Types can be defined.  The ticket consists of a Ticket Policy as well
   as Ticket Data.  The Ticket Policy contains information intended for
   all parties involved, whereas the Ticket Data is only intended for
   the party that resolves the ticket.  The Ticket Data could be a
   reference to information (keys, etc.) stored by the key management
   service, it could contain all the information itself, or it could be
   a combination of the two alternatives.  The format of the Ticket Data

   depends on the Ticket Type signaled in the Ticket Policy.  The Ticket
   Data corresponding to the default Ticket Type, called MIKEY base
   ticket, is defined in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> and requirements regarding new
   Ticket Types are given in <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>.

   As MIKEY-TICKET is based on [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>], the same terminology,
   processing, and considerations still apply unless otherwise stated.
   Just like in [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>], the messages are integrity protected and
   encryption is only applied to the keys and not to the entire
   messages.

   Depending on the Ticket Type and the Ticket Policy, some of the
   exchanges might be optional or not used at all, see Figure 3.  If the
   ticket protection is based on a key known only by the KMS, both the
   Initiator and the Responder have to contact the KMS to request/
   resolve tickets (mode 1).  If the key used to protect the ticket is
   shared between the KMS and the Responder, the Ticket Resolve exchange
   can be omitted (similar to Kerberos), as the Responder can resolve
   the ticket without assistance from the KMS (mode 2).

   If the key protecting the ticket is shared between the Initiator and
   the KMS, the Ticket Request exchange can be omitted (similar to the
   Otway-Rees protocol [<a href="#ref-Otway-Rees" title='"Efficient and Timely Mutual Authentication"'>Otway-Rees</a>]), as the Initiator can create the
   ticket without assistance from the KMS (mode 3).  If the key

   protecting the ticket is shared between the Initiator and the
   Responder, both the Ticket Request and Ticket Resolve exchanges can
   be omitted (mode 4).  This can be seen as a variation of the pre-
   shared key method of [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>] with a mutual key-freshness guarantee.

   In modes 1 and 2, the Ticket Request exchange can be omitted if the
   tickets and the corresponding keys are distributed from the KMS to
   the Initiator in some other way.  In addition, as tickets may be
   reused (see <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>), a single Ticket Request exchange may be
   followed by several Ticket Transfer exchanges.

   This exchange is used by the Initiator to request keys and a ticket
   from a trusted KMS with which the Initiator has pre-shared
   credentials.  The request contains information (e.g., participant
   identities, etc.) describing the session the ticket is intended to
   protect.  A full round trip is required for the Initiator to receive
   the ticket.  The initial message REQUEST_INIT comes in two variants.
   The first variant corresponds to the pre-shared key (PSK) method of
   [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>].

                                              TICKET, KEMAC, V

   The second variant corresponds to the public-key (PK) method of
   [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>].

   Initiator                               KMS

   As the REQUEST_INIT message MUST ensure the identity of the Initiator
   to the KMS, it SHALL be integrity protected by a MAC based on a pre-
   shared key or by a signature.  The response message REQUEST_RESP is
   the same for the two variants and SHALL be protected using the pre-
   shared/envelope key indicated in the REQUEST_INIT message.

   In addition to the ticket, the Initiator receives keys, which it does
   not already know.  The ticket contains both session information and
   information needed to resolve the ticket later, see <a href="#section-6.10">Section 6.10</a>.

<span class="h5"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.2.1.1.%20%20Common%20Components%20of%20the%20REQUEST_INIT%20Messages"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.2.1.1" name="section-4.2.1.1">4.2.1.1</a>.  Common Components of the REQUEST_INIT Messages</span>

   The REQUEST_INIT message MUST always include the Header (HDR),
   Timestamp (T), and RANDRi payloads.

   In HDR, the CSB ID (Crypto Session Bundle ID) SHALL be assigned as in
   [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>].  The V flag MUST be set to '1' but SHALL be ignored by the
   KMS as a response is MANDATORY.  As Crypto Sessions (CSs) SHALL NOT
   be handled, the #CS MUST be set to '0' and the CS ID map type SHALL
   be the "Empty map" as defined in [<a href="rfc4563.html" title='"The Key ID Information Type for the General Extension Payload in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)"'>RFC4563</a>].

   IDRi contains the identity of the Initiator.  This identity SHOULD be
   included in the granted Ticket Policy.

   IDRkms contains the identity of the KMS.  It SHOULD be included, but
   it MAY be left out when it can be expected that the KMS has a single
   identity.

   The Ticket Policy payload (TP) contains the desired Ticket Policy.
   It includes for instance, the ticket's validity period, the number of
   requested keys, and the identities of authorized responders (see
   <a href="#section-6.10">Section 6.10</a>).

   The IDRi payload SHOULD be included but MAY be left out when it can
   be expected that the KMS can identify the Initiator by other means.

   The IDRpsk payload is used to indicate the pre-shared key used.  It
   MAY be omitted if the KMS can find the pre-shared key by other means.

   The last payload SHALL be a Verification payload (V) where the
   authentication key (auth_key) is derived from the pre-shared key
   shared by the Initiator and the KMS (see <a href="#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2</a> for key
   derivation specification).  The MAC SHALL cover the entire
   REQUEST_INIT_PSK message as well as the identities of the involved
   parties (see <a href="#section-5.5">Section 5.5</a> for the exact definition).

   separate CERT payload.  The Initiator's certificate MUST come first.
   Each following certificate MUST directly certify the one preceding
   it.

   PKE contains the encrypted envelope key: PKE = E(PKkms, env_key).  It
   is encrypted using the KMS's public key (PKkms).  If the KMS
   possesses several public keys, the Initiator can indicate the key
   used in the CHASH payload.

   SIGNi is a signature covering the entire REQUEST_INIT_PK message,
   using the Initiator's signature key (see <a href="#section-5.5">Section 5.5</a> for the exact

   If the KMS can verify the integrity of the received message and the
   message can be correctly parsed, the KMS MUST check the Initiator's
   authorization.  If the Initiator is authorized to receive the
   requested ticket, possibly with a modified Ticket Policy, the KMS
   MUST send a REQUEST_RESP message.  Unexpected payloads in the
   REQUEST_INIT message SHOULD be ignored.  Errors are handled as
   described in <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>.

   The version, PRF func and CSB ID, #CS, and CS ID map type fields in
   the HDR payload SHALL be identical to the corresponding fields in the
   REQUEST_INIT message.  The V flag has no meaning in this context.  It
   SHALL be set to '0' by the KMS and ignored by the Initiator.

   If one of the NTP timestamp types is used, the KMS SHALL generate a
   fresh timestamp value (unlike [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>]), which may be used for clock
   synchronization.  If the COUNTER timestamp type (see <a href="rfc3830.html#section-6.6">Section 6.6 of
   [RFC3830]</a>) is used, the timestamp value MAY be equal to the one in
   the REQUEST_INIT message.

   The TICKET payload carries the granted Ticket Policy and the Ticket
   Data (see <a href="#section-6.10">Section 6.10</a>).  As the KMS decides which Ticket Policy to
   use, this may not be the same Ticket Policy as the Initiator
   requested.  The Ticket Type and the Ticket Data depend on the granted
   Ticket Policy.

   The KEMAC payload SHALL use the NULL authentication algorithm, as a
   MAC is included in the V payload.  Depending on the type of
   REQUEST_INIT message, either the pre-shared key or the envelope key
   SHALL be used to derive the encr_key (and salt_key).  Depending on
   the encryption algorithm, the salting key may go into the IV (see

   include a single TGK.  The KEMAC SHALL include an MPK (MIKEY
   Protection Key), MPKi, used as a pre-shared key to protect the
   messages in the Ticket Transfer exchange.  If key forking (see

   This exchange is used to transfer a ticket as well as session
   information from the Initiator to a Responder.  The exchange is
   modeled after the pre-shared key mode [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>], but instead of a
   pre-shared key, an MPK encoded in the ticket is used.  The session
   keys are also encoded in the TICKET payload, but in some use cases
   (see <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>) they need to be sent in a separate KEMAC payload.
   The session information may be sent from the Initiator to the
   Responder (similar to [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>]) or from the Responder to the
   Initiator (similar to [<a href="rfc4738.html" title='"MIKEY-RSA-R: An Additional Mode of Key Distribution in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)"'>RFC4738</a>]).  As the motive for this exchange is
   to setup a shared secret key between Initiator and Responder, the
   Responder cannot check the authenticity of the message before the
   ticket is resolved (by KMS or Responder).  A full round trip is
   required if Responder key confirmation and freshness guarantee are
   needed.

   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>), and Initiator Data.  The Ticket Policy contains
   information intended for all parties involved, whereas the Ticket
   Data is only intended for the party that resolves the ticket.  The
   Ticket Type provided in the Ticket Data is indicated in the Ticket
   Policy.  The Initiator Data authenticates the Initiator when key
   forking (I flag) is used.

   The KEMAC payload is handled in the same way as if it were sent in a
   later CSB update (see <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>), with the only difference that the
   encr_key is always derived from MPKi and therefore accessible by all
   responders authorized to resolve the ticket.  Initiator-specified
   keys MAY be used if the Initiator has pre-encrypted content and
   specific TEKs (Traffic Encryption Keys) need to be used (see
   <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>).  If indicated by the Ticket Policy (L flag), a KEMAC
   payload SHALL NOT be included.

   As the Initiator and Responder do not have any pre-shared keys, the
   Responder cannot check the authenticity of the message before the
   ticket is resolved.  The Responder SHALL however check that both the
   Ticket Policy and the security policies are acceptable.  If they are
   not, the Responder SHALL reject without contacting the KMS.  This is
   an early reject mechanism to avoid unnecessary KMS signaling when the
   Responder can conclude from the information at hand that it will not
   accept the connection.  After the ticket has been resolved, the
   parsing of the TRANSFER_INIT message continues.  Unexpected payloads
   in the TRANSFER_INIT message SHOULD be ignored.  Errors are handled

   The version, PRF func and CSB ID fields in the HDR payload SHALL be

   The V flag has no meaning in this context.  It SHALL be set to '0' by
   the Responder and ignored by the Initiator.  The Responder SHALL
   update the CS ID map info so that each crypto session has exactly one
   security policy indicated.  The Responder MUST provide Session Data
   (at least for SRTP) and SPI for each crypto session for which the
   Initiator has not supplied Session Data and SPI.  If needed, the
   Responder MAY update Session Data and SPI provided by the Initiator.
   If the Responder adds crypto sessions, the #CS SHALL be updated.

   If one of the NTP timestamp types is used, the Responder SHALL
   generate a fresh timestamp value (unlike [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>]).  If the COUNTER
   timestamp type (see <a href="rfc3830.html#section-6.6">Section 6.6 of [RFC3830]</a>) is used, the timestamp
   value MAY be equal to the one in the TRANSFER_INIT message.

   If indicated by the Ticket Policy (G flag), the Responder SHALL
   generate a fresh (pseudo-)random byte string RANDRr.  RANDRr is used
   to produce Responder freshness guarantee in key derivations.

   message, the same identity MUST be sent in an IDRr payload in the
   TRANSFER_RESP message.  The identity sent in the IDRr payload in the

   TRANSFER_RESP message (e.g., user1@example.com) MAY differ from the
   one sent in the IDRr payload in the TRANSFER_INIT message (e.g.,

   If the Responder receives a RANDRkms payload in the RESOLVE_RESP
   message, the same RAND MUST be sent in a RANDRkms payload in the
   TRANSFER_RESP message.

   The Responder MAY provide additional Security Policy payloads.  The
   Responder SHOULD NOT resend SP payloads, which the Initiator
   supplied.

   The KEMAC payload SHALL be handled exactly as if it was sent in a

   If the Initiator can verify the integrity of the received message and

   This exchange is used by the Responder to request that the KMS return
   the keys encoded in a ticket.  The KMS does not need to be the same
   KMS that originally issued the ticket, see <a href="#section-10">Section 10</a>.  A full round
   trip is required for the Responder to receive the keys.  The Ticket
   Resolve exchange is OPTIONAL (depending on the Ticket Policy), and
   SHOULD only be used when the Responder is unable to resolve the
   ticket without assistance from the KMS.  The initial message
   RESOLVE_INIT comes in two variants (independent from the used
   REQUEST_INIT variant).  The first variant corresponds to the pre-
   shared key (PSK) method of [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>].

   As the RESOLVE_INIT message MUST ensure the identity of the Responder
   to the KMS, it SHALL be protected by a MAC based on a pre-shared key
   or by a signature.  The response message RESOLVE_RESP is the same for
   the two variants and SHALL be protected by using the pre-shared/
   envelope key indicated in the RESOLVE_INIT message.

   Upon receiving the RESOLVE_INIT message, the KMS verifies that the
   Responder is authorized to resolve the ticket based on ticket and KMS
   policies.  The KMS extracts the session information from the ticket
   and returns this to the Responder.  Since the KMS resolved the
   ticket, the Responder is assured of the integrity of the Ticket
   Policy, which contains the identity of the peer that requested or
   created the ticket.  If key forking is used (I flag), the Responder
   is also assured that the peer that requested or created the ticket
   also sent the TRANSFER_INIT message.  The Responder can complete the
   session information it got from the Initiator with the additional
   session information received from the KMS.

   If one of the NTP timestamp types is used, the KMS SHALL generate a
   fresh timestamp value (unlike [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>]), which may be used for clock
   synchronization.  If the COUNTER timestamp type (see <a href="rfc3830.html#section-6.6">Section 6.6 of
   [RFC3830]</a>) is used, the timestamp value MAY be equal to the one in
   the RESOLVE_INIT message.

   The KEMAC payload SHALL use the NULL authentication algorithm, as a
   MAC is included in the V payload.  Depending on the type of
   RESOLVE_INIT message, either the pre-shared key or the envelope key
   SHALL be used to derive the encr_key (and salt_key).  Depending on
   the encryption algorithm, the salting key may go into the IV (see
   [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>]).  The KEMAC SHALL include an MPK (MPKi), used as a pre-
   shared key to protect the messages in the Ticket Transfer exchange.
   The KEMAC is hence constructed as follows:

           KEMAC = E(encr_key, MPKi || [MPKr'] || {TEK|TGK|GTGK})

   If key forking (see <a href="#section-5.1.1">Section 5.1.1</a>) is used (determined by the I flag
   in the Ticket Policy), a second MPK (MPKr') SHALL be included in the
   KEMAC.  Then, MPKi SHALL be used to verify the TRANSFER_INIT message
   and MPKr' SHALL be used to protect the TRANSFER_RESP message.  The
   KMS SHALL also fork the MPKr and the TGKs.  The modifier used to
   derive the forked keys SHALL be included in the IDRr and RANDRkms
   payloads, where IDRr is the identity of the endpoint that answered
   and RANDRkms is a fresh (pseudo-)random byte string generated by the
   KMS.  The reason that the KMS MAY adjust the Responder's identity is
   so that it matches an identity encoded in the ticket.

   The last payload SHALL be a Verification payload (V).  Depending on
   the type of RESOLVE_INIT message, either the pre-shared key or the
   envelope key SHALL be used to derive the auth_key.  The MAC SHALL

   For all messages in the Ticket Request and Ticket Resolve exchanges,
   the keys used to protect the MIKEY messages are derived from a pre-
   shared key or an envelope key.  As crypto sessions SHALL NOT be
   handled, further keying material (i.e., TEKs) does not have to be
   derived.

   In the Ticket Transfer exchange, the keys used to protect the MIKEY
   messages are derived from an MPK.  If key forking is used, the KMS
   and the Initiator SHALL fork the MPKr and the TGKs (encoded in the
   ticket) based on a modifier, and different MPKs (MPKi and MPKr')
   SHALL be used to protect the TRANSFER_INIT and TRANSFER_RESP
   messages.  In addition, the Responder MAY generate a RAND used to
   give Responder key freshness guarantee.

   The key hierarchy and its dependencies on TRANSFER_INIT message
   contents for the case without key forking and RANDRr are illustrated
   in Figure 4.  The KEMAC shown is the KEMAC sent from the KMS to the
   Initiator and the Responder.  The illustrated key derivations are
   done by the Initiator and the Responder.

          Figure 4: Key hierarchy without key forking and RANDRr

   The key hierarchy and its dependencies on TRANSFER_RESP message
   contents for the case with key forking and RANDRr are illustrated in
   Figure 5.  The KEMAC shown is the KEMAC sent from the KMS to the
   Initiator.  MOD is the modifier (IDRr, RANDRkms).  The two key
   derivations that produce forked keys are done by the Initiator and
   the KMS, and the remaining two key derivations are done by the
   Initiator and the Responder.  The random value RANDRi from the
   TRANSFER_INIT message is used as input to the derivation of the
   auth_key and may be used as input to the derivation of the TEK, but
   this is omitted from the figure.  The protection of the TRANSFER_INIT
   message is done as in Figure 4.

   Similar to [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>], MIKEY-TICKET provides a means of updating the
   CSB (Crypto Session Bundle), e.g., transporting a new TEK/TGK/GTGK or
   adding new crypto sessions.  The CSB updating is done by executing
   the Ticket Transfer exchange again, e.g., before a TEK expires or
   when a new crypto session is needed.  The CSB updating can be started
   by the Initiator:

   Initiator                               Responder

   TRANSFER_INIT =                 ----&gt;
   HDR, T, [IDRi], [IDRr],
      {SP}, [KEMAC], V              &lt; - -  TRANSFER_RESP =
                                           HDR, T, [IDRr],
                                           {SP}, [KEMAC], V

   The CSB updating can also be started by the Responder:

   Responder                               Initiator

   TRANSFER_INIT =                 ----&gt;
   HDR, T, [IDRr], [IDRi],
      {SP}, [KEMAC], V              &lt; - -  TRANSFER_RESP =
                                           HDR, T, [IDRi],
                                           {SP}, [KEMAC], V

   The new message exchange MUST use the same CSB ID as the initial
   exchange but MUST use new timestamps.  The crypto sessions
   negotiation (#CS field, CS ID map info field, and SP payloads) are
   handled as in the initial exchange.  In the TRANSFER_INIT message the
   V flag SHALL be used to indicate whether or not a response message is
   expected.  Static payloads such as RANDRi, RANDRr, RANDRkms, and
   TICKET that were provided in the initial exchange SHOULD NOT be
   included unless they are needed by a specific use case.  New RANDs or
   TICKETs MUST NOT be included.  The reason that new RANDs SHALL NOT be
   used is that if several TGKs are used, the peers would need to keep
   track of which RANDs to use for each TGK.  This adds unnecessary
   complexity.  Both messages SHALL be protected with the same keys
   (derived from MPKi or MPKr') that protected the last message
   (TRANSFER_INIT or TRANSFER_RESP) in the initial exchange.

   New keying material MAY be sent in a KEMAC payload.  If indicated by
   the Ticket Policy (L and M flags), KEMAC payloads SHALL NOT be
   included.  In the TRANSFER_RESP message, a session key MUST be
   provided for each crypto session.  The KEMAC SHALL use the NULL
   authentication algorithm, as a MAC is included in the V payload.  The
   encr_key (and salt_key) SHALL be derived from the MPK (MPKi or
   MPKr').  Depending on the encryption algorithm, the salting key may
   go into the IV (see [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>]).  If a new TGK is exchanged, it SHALL
   NOT be forked.  The KEMAC is hence constructed as follows:

                    KEMAC = E(encr_key, (TEK|TGK|GTGK))

   MIKEY-TICKET includes features aiming to offload the KMS from
   receiving ticket requests.  One such feature is that tickets may be
   reused.  This means that a user may request a ticket for media
   sessions with another user and then under the ticket's validity
   period use this ticket to protect several media sessions with that
   user.

   When reusing a ticket that has been used in a previous Ticket
   Transfer exchange, a new Ticket Transfer exchange is executed.  The
   new exchange MUST use a new CSB ID, a new timestamp, and new RANDs
   (RANDRi, RANDRr).  If the Responder has resolved the ticket before,
   the Responder does not need to resolve the ticket again.  In that
   case, the same modifier (IDRr, RANDRkms) SHALL be used.  If the
   Ticket Policy forbids reuse (J flag), the ticket MUST NOT be reused.
   Note that such reuse cannot be detected by a stateless KMS.  When
   group keys are used, ticket reuse leaves the Initiator responsible to
   ensure that group membership has not changed since the ticket was
   last used.  (Otherwise, unauthorized responders may gain access to
   the group communication.)  Thus, if group dynamics are difficult to
   verify, the Initiator SHOULD NOT initiate ticket reuse.

   When key forking is used, only the user that requested the ticket has
   access to the encoded master keys (MPKr, TGKs).  Because of this, no
   one else can initiate a Ticket Transfer exchange using the ticket.

   If a fatal error occurs during the parsing of a message, the message
   SHOULD be discarded, and an Error message SHOULD be sent to the other
   party (Initiator, Responder, KMS).  If a failure is due to the
   inability to authenticate the peer, the message SHALL be discarded,
   the Error message is OPTIONAL, and the caveats in <a href="rfc3830.html#section-5.1.2">Section 5.1.2 of
   [RFC3830]</a> apply.  Error messages may be used to report errors in both
   initial and response messages, but not in Error messages.

   In the Ticket Request and Ticket Resolve exchanges, the Error message
   MAY be authenticated with a MAC or a signature.  The Error message is
   hence constructed as follows:

                  Error message = HDR, T, (ERR), [V|SIGNx]

   where x is in the set {i, r, kms} (Initiator, Responder, KMS).
   Unexpected payloads in the Error message SHOULD be ignored.

   In the Ticket Transfer exchange, the Error message MAY be
   authenticated with a MAC.  If the suggested security policies are not
   supported, the Error message SHOULD include the supported parameters.
   The Error message is hence constructed as follows:

                  Error message = HDR, T, (ERR), {SP}, [V]

   In Error messages, the version, PRF func, and CSB ID fields in the
   HDR payload SHALL be identical to the corresponding fields in the
   message where the error occurred.  The V field SHALL be set to '0'
   and be ignored.

   If one of the NTP timestamp types is used, a fresh timestamp value
   SHALL be used.  If the COUNTER timestamp type (see <a href="rfc3830.html#section-6.6">Section 6.6 of
   [RFC3830]</a>) is used, the timestamp value MAY be equal to the one in
   the message where the error occurred.

   The MAC/Signature in the V/SIGN payloads covers the entire Error
   message, except the MAC/Signature field itself.  The auth_key SHALL
   be the same as in the message where the error occurred.

   The MAC/Signature in the V/SIGN payloads covers the entire MIKEY
   message, except the MAC/Signature field itself.  For initial
   messages, the identities (not whole payloads) of the parties involved
   MUST directly follow the MIKEY message in the Verification MAC/
   Signature calculation.  In the TRANSFER_INIT message, the MAC SHALL
   NOT cover the Initiator Data length and Initiator Data fields in the
   TICKET payload.  Note that in the Transfer Exchange, Identity_r in
   TRANSFER_RESP (e.g., user1@example.com) MAY differ from that
   appearing in TRANSFER_INIT (e.g., IT-support@example.com).  For
   response messages, the entire initial message (including the MAC/
   Signature field) MUST directly follow the MIKEY message in the
   Verification MAC/Signature calculation (the identities are implicitly
   covered as they are covered by the initial message's MAC/Signature).

      *  Policy_no_i (8 bits): a policy_no that corresponds to the
         policy_no of a SP payload.  In response messages, the policy_no
         may refer to a SP payload in the initial message.

   *  Session Data Length (16 bits): the length of Session Data (in
      bytes).  For the Prot type SRTP, Session Data MAY be omitted in
      the initial message (length = 0), but it MUST be provided in the
      response message.

   *  Session Data (variable length): contains session data for the
      crypto session.  The type of Session Data depends on the specified
      Prot type.  The Session Data for the Prot type SRTP is defined
      below.  The S flag is used to indicate whether the ROC and SEQ
      fields are provided ('1') or if they are omitted ('0').

         crypto session.  Note that unlike [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>], an SSRC field set
         to '0' has no special meaning.

      *  ROC (32 bits): current/initial rollover counter.  If the
         session has not started, this field is set to '0'.

      *  SEQ (16 bits): current/initial sequence number.

   *  SPI Length (8 bits): the length of SPI (in bytes).  SPI MAY be
      omitted in the initial message (length = 0), but it MUST be
      provided in the response message.

   *  SPI (variable length): the SPI (or MKI) corresponding to the
      session key to (initially) be used for the crypto session.  This
      does not exclude other keys to be used.  All keys MUST belong to
      the crypto session bundle.

                      Table 6.5: Encr alg (Additions)

   The new encryption algorithm is defined as described in <a href="rfc3830.html#section-4.2.3">Section 4.2.3
   of [RFC3830]</a> with the only difference being that a 256-bit key SHALL

   For the key data sub-payload, new types of keys are defined.  The
   Group TGK (GTGK) is used as a regular TGK, with the difference that
   it SHALL NOT be forked.  It is intended to enable the establishment
   of a group TGK when key forking is used.  The MIKEY Protection Key
   (MPK) is used to protect the MIKEY messages in the Ticket Transfer
   exchange.  The MPK is used as the pre-shared key in the pre-shared
   key method of [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>]; however, it is not known by the Responder
   before the ticket has been resolved.

   An SPI (or MKI) MUST be specified for each key (see <a href="rfc3830.html#section-6.13">Section 6.13 of
   [RFC3830]</a>).

   *  Type (4 bits): indicates the type of key included in the payload.

   For the timestamp payload, a new type of timestamp is defined.  The
   new type is intended to be used when defining validity periods, where
   fractions of seconds seldom matter.  The NTP-UTC-32 string contains
   four bytes, in the same format as the first four bytes in the NTP
   timestamp format, defined in [<a href="rfc4330.html" title='"Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI"'>RFC4330</a>].  This represents the number
   of seconds since 0h on 1 January 1900 with respect to the Coordinated
   Universal Time (UTC).  On 7 February 2036, the time value will
   overflow.  [<a href="rfc4330.html" title='"Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI"'>RFC4330</a>] describes a procedure to extend the time to 2104
   and this procedure is MANDATORY to support.

   *  TS Type (8 bits): specifies the timestamp type used.

                        TS Type    | Value | Length

                       Table 6.8: TS Type (Additions)

   NTP-UTC-32 SHALL be padded to a 64-bit NTP-UTC timestamp (with zeroes
   in the fractional second part) when a 64-bit timestamp is required
   (e.g.  IV creation in AES-CM-128 and AES-CM-256).

   The TR payload uses all the fields from the standard timestamp
   payload (T) but expands it with a new field describing the role of
   the timestamp.  Whereas the TS Type describes the type of the TS
   Value, the TS Role describes the meaning of the timestamp itself.
   The TR payload is intended to eliminate ambiguity when a MIKEY
   message contains several timestamp payloads (e.g., in the Ticket
   Policy).

   For the ID payload, a new ID Type byte string is defined.  The byte
   string type is intended to be used when the ID payload is used to
   identify a pre-shared key.  Contrary to the previously defined ID
   Types (URI, Network Access Identifier), the byte string does not have
   any encoding rules.

   The IDR payload uses all the fields from the standard identity
   payload (ID) but expands it with a new field describing the role of
   the ID payload.  Whereas the ID Type describes the type of the ID
   Data, the ID Role describes the meaning of the identity itself.  The
   IDR payload is intended to eliminate ambiguity when a MIKEY message
   contains several identity payloads.  The IDR payload MUST be used
   instead of the ID payload in all MIKEY-TICKET messages.

   Note that the Ticket Policy payload (TP) and the Ticket Payload
   (TICKET) are two different payloads (having different payload
   identifiers).  However, as they share much of the payload structure,
   they are described in the same section.

   The Ticket Policy payload contains a desired Ticket Policy and does
   not include the Ticket Data length, Ticket Data, Initiator Data
   length, or Initiator Data fields.  The ticket payload contains the
   granted Ticket Policy as well as Ticket Data (the default ticket type
   is defined in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>).  The Ticket Policy contains information
   intended for all parties involved whereas the Ticket Data is only
   intended for the party that resolves the ticket.  The Ticket Type
   provided in the Ticket Data is indicated in the Ticket Policy.  When
   key forking is used (I flag), the Initiator Data authenticates the
   Initiator.

   Note that the flags are not independent: NOT D implies L, G implies
   F, NOT G implies H, NOT H implies G, I implies E, K implies D, and M
   implies F.  The F flag SHALL be set to '1' when the I flag (key
   forking) is set to '1' and a TGK is encoded in the ticket.

      IDRkms contains the identity of a KMS that can resolve the ticket.

      IDRi contains the identity of the peer that requested or created
      the ticket.

      TRs is the start of the validity period.  TRs SHALL be interpreted
      as being in the range 1968-2104 as described in [<a href="rfc4330.html" title='"Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI"'>RFC4330</a>].  An
      omitted TRs means that the validity period has no defined
      beginning.

      TRe is the end of the validity period.  TRe SHALL be interpreted
      as being in the range 1968-2104 as described in [<a href="rfc4330.html" title='"Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4, IPv6 and OSI"'>RFC4330</a>].  An
      omitted TRe means that the validity period has no defined end.

      TRr indicates how often rekeying MUST be done.  TS Type SHALL be
      NTP-UTC-32 and the time between two rekeyings SHALL NOT be longer
      than the number of seconds in the integer part of the timestamp.
      How the rekeying is done is implementation specific.

      The KEMAC payload may be used to indicate the number of requested
      keys and specify other key information (key type, key length, and
      KV (key validity) data).  The KEMAC payload SHALL use the NULL
      encryption algorithm and the NULL authentication algorithm, as a
      MAC is included in the V payload.  The KEMAC is hence constructed
      as follows:

                           KEMAC = {TEK|TGK|GTGK}

   The Key Data fields SHALL be set to '0' by the Initiator and ignored
   by the KMS.  The KEMAC SHALL NOT be present in the granted Ticket
   Policy.

      IDRapp is an identifier for an authorized application ID.  The
      application IDs are implementation specific.  If no IDRapp
      payloads are supplied, all application IDs are authorized.

      IDRr is the identity of a responder or a group of responders that
      are authorized to resolve the ticket.  If there is more than one
      responder identity, each responder identity SHALL be included in a
      separate IDR payload.

   *  Ticket Data length (16 bits): the length of the Ticket Data field
      (in bytes).  Not present in the TP payload.

      The Vi payload SHALL be identical to the V payload in the
      TRANSFER_INIT message.

      The last payload (Vr) SHALL be a Verification payload where the
      MAC SHALL cover the entire Initiator Data field except the MAC
      field itself.  The authentication algorithm SHALL be the same as
      used for the Vi payload.  The authentication key (auth_key) SHALL

   MIKEY messages are not tied to any specific transport protocols.  In
   [<a href="rfc4567.html" title='"Key Management Extensions for Session Description Protocol (SDP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)"'>RFC4567</a>], extensions for SDP and RTSP to carry MIKEY messages (and
   therefore MIKEY-TICKET messages) are defined.  The messages in the
   Ticket Transfer exchange (TRANSFER_INIT, TRANSFER_RESP) are
   preferably included in the session setup signaling (e.g., SIP INVITE
   and 200 OK).  However, it may not be suitable for the MIKEY-TICKET
   exchanges that do not establish keying material for media sessions
   (Ticket Request and Ticket Resolve) to be carried in SDP or RTSP.  If
   SDP or RTSP is not used, the transport protocol needs to be defined.
   In [<a href="#ref-3GPP.33.328" title='"IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) media plane security"'>3GPP.33.328</a>], it is defined how the Ticket Request and Ticket
   Resolve exchanges are carried over HTTP.

   The default setting is that the KMS supplies the session keys
   (encoded in the ticket).  This is not possible if the content is pre-
   encrypted (e.g., Video on Demand).  In such use cases, the key

   exchange is typically reversed and MAY be carried out as follows.
   The Initiator sends a ticket without encoded session keys to the
   Responder in a TRANSFER_INIT message.  The Responder has access to
   the TEKs used to protect the requested content, but may not be

   If a group key is used, the group key and session information may be
   pushed to all group members (similar to [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>]), or distributed
   when requested (similar to [<a href="rfc4738.html" title='"MIKEY-RSA-R: An Additional Mode of Key Distribution in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)"'>RFC4738</a>]).  If a TGK/GTGK is used as a
   group key, the same RANDs MUST be used to derive the session keys in
   all Ticket Transfer exchanges.  Also note caveats with ticket reuse
   in group communication settings as discussed in <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>.

   When key forking is used, only the user that requested the ticket can
   initiate a Ticket Transfer exchange using that ticket, see
   <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>.  So if a group key is to be distributed, the MIKEY
   signaling MUST be centralized to the party that initially requested
   the ticket, or different tickets needs to be used in each Ticket
   Transfer exchange and the group key needs to be sent in a KEMAC.

   Another consideration is that different users get different session
   keys if TGKs (encoded in the ticket) are used.

   A user can in general only be expected to have a trust relation with
   a single KMS.  Different users might therefore use tickets issued by
   different KMSs using only locally known keys.  Thus, if users with
   trust relations to different KMSs are to be able to establish a
   secure session with each other, the KMSs involved have to cooperate
   and there has to be a trust relation between them.  The KMSs SHALL be
   mutually authenticated and signaling between them SHALL be integrity
   and confidentiality protected.  The technical means for the inter-KMS
   security is however outside the scope of this specification.  Under
   these assumptions, the following approach MAY be used.

   If the Responder cannot directly resolve a ticket, the ticket SHOULD
   be included in a RESOLVE_INIT message sent to a KMS.  If the
   Responder does not have a shared credential with the KMS that issued
   the ticket (KMS I) or if the Responder does not know which KMS issued
   the ticket, the Responder SHOULD send the RESOLVE_INIT message to one
   of the Responder's trusted KMSs (KMS R).  If KMS R did not issue the
   ticket, KMS R would normally be unable to directly resolve the ticket
   and must hence ask another KMS to resolve it (typically the issuing
   KMS).

   The signaling between different KMSs MAY be done with a Ticket
   Resolve exchange as illustrated in Figure 9.  The IDRr and TICKET
   payloads from the previous RESOLVE_INIT message SHOULD be reused.
   Note that IDRr cannot be used to look up the pre-shared key/
   certificate.

   The Ticket Data (in the TICKET payload) could be a reference to
   information (keys, etc.) stored by the key management service, it
   could contain all the information itself, or it could be a
   combination of the two alternatives.  For systems serving many users,
   it is not ideal to use the reference-only ticket approach as this
   would force the key management service to keep state of all issued
   tickets that are still valid.  Tickets may carry many different types
   of information helping to enforce usage policies.  The policies may
   be group policies or per-user policies.

   Tickets may either be transparent, meaning they can be resolved
   without contacting the KMS that generated them, or opaque, meaning
   that the original KMS must be contacted.  The ticket information
   SHOULD typically be integrity protected and certain fields need
   confidentiality protection, in particular, the keys if explicitly
   included.  Other types of information may also require
   confidentiality protection due to privacy reasons.  In mode 2 (see
   <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>), it may be preferable to include several encrypted
   ticket protection keys (similar to Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail
   Extensions (S/MIME)) as this may allow multiple peers to resolve the
   ticket.

   The Ticket Data MUST include information so that the resolving party
   can retrieve an encoded KEMAC.  It MUST also be possible to verify
   the integrity of the TICKET payload.  It is RECOMMENDED that future
   specifications use the recommended payload order and do not add any
   additional payloads or processing.  New Ticket Types SHOULD NOT
   change the processing for the Responder.  If a new Ticket Type

   requires additional processing, it MUST be indicated in the Ticket

   are supported and if any additional security considerations apply.

   Unless otherwise stated, the security considerations in [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>]
   still apply and contain notes on the security properties of the MIKEY
   protocol, key derivation functions, and other components.  As some
   security properties depend on the specific Ticket Type, only generic
   security considerations concerning the MIKEY-TICKET framework are
   discussed.

   This specification includes a large number of optional features,
   which adds complexity to the general case.  Protocol designers are
   strongly encouraged to establish strict profiles defining MIKEY-
   TICKET options (e.g., exchanges or message fields) that SHOULD or
   MUST be supported.  Such profiles should preclude unexpected
   consequences from compliant implementations with wildly differing
   option sets.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/12.1.%20%20General"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-12.1" name="section-12.1">12.1</a>.  General</span>

   In addition to the Ticket Policy, the KMS MAY have its own set of
   policies (authorized key lengths, algorithms, etc.) that in some way
   are shared with the peers.  The KMS MAY also provide keying material
   to authorized intermediate nodes performing various network functions
   (e.g., transcoding services, recording services, conference bridges).
   The key management service can enforce end-to-end security by only
   distributing the keys to authorized end-users.  As in [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>], the
   user identities are not confidentiality protected.  If user privacy
   is needed, some kind of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET) like
   anonymous or temporary credentials MAY be used.

   In the standard MIKEY modes [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>], the keys are generated by the
   Initiator (or by both peers in the Diffie-Hellman scheme).  If a bad
   PRNG (Pseudorandom Number Generator) is used, this is likely to make
   any key management protocol sensitive to different kinds of attacks,
   and MIKEY is no exception.  As the choice of the PRNG is
   implementation specific, the easiest (and often bad) choice is to use
   the PRNG supplied by the operating system.  In MIKEY-TICKET's default
   mode of operation, the key generation is mostly done by the KMS,
   which can be assumed to be less likely to use a bad random number
   generator.  All keys (including keys used to protect the ticket) MUST
   have adequate strength/length, i.e., 128 bits or more.

   The use of random nonces (RANDs) in the key derivation is of utmost
   importance to counter offline pre-computation attacks and other
   generic attacks.  A key of length n, using RANDs of length r, has
   effective key entropy of (n + r) / 2 against a birthday attack.
   Therefore, the sum of the lengths of RANDRi and RANDRr MUST at least
   be equal to the size of the longest pre-shared key/envelope key/MPK/
   TGK/GTGK, RANDRkms MUST at least be as long as the longest MPKr/TGK,
   and the RAND in the MIKEY base ticket MUST at least be as long as the
   longest of TPK and MPK.

   Note that the CSB Updating messages reuse the old RANDs.  This means
   that the total effective key entropy (relative to pre-computation
   attacks) for k consecutive key updates, assuming the TGKs are each n
   bits long, is still no more than n bits.  In other words, the time
   and memory needed by an attacker to get all k n-bit keys are
   proportional to 2^n.  While this might seem like a defect, this is in
   practice (for all reasonable values of k) not better than brute
   force, which on average requires k * 2^(n-1) work (even if different
   RANDs would be used).  A birthday attack would only require 2^(n/2)
   work, but would need access to 2^(n/2) sessions protected with
   equally many different keys using a single pair of RANDs.  This is,
   for typical values of n, clearly totally infeasible.  The success
   probability of such an attack can be controlled by limiting the
   number of updates correspondingly.  As stated in [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>], the fact
   that more than one key can be compromised in a single attack is
   inherent to any solution using secret- or public-key algorithms.  An
   attacker always gets access to all the exchanged keys by doing an
   exhaustive search on the pre-shared key/envelope key/MPK.  This
   requires 2^m work, where m is the effective size of the key.

   As the Responder MAY generate a RAND, the Ticket Transfer exchange
   can provide mutual freshness guarantee for all derived keys.

   The new algorithms PRF-HMAC-SHA-256, AES-CM-256, and HMAC-SHA-256-256
   use 256-bit keys and offer a higher security level than the
   previously defined algorithms.  If one of the 256-bit algorithms are
   supported, the other two algorithms SHALL also be supported.  The
   256-bit algorithms SHOULD be used together, and they SHALL NOT be
   mixed with algorithms using key sizes less than 256 bits.  If session
   keys (TEK/TGK/GTGK) longer than 128 bits are used, 128-bit algorithms
   SHALL NOT be used.

   In some situations, the TRANSFER_INIT message may be delivered to
   multiple endpoints.  For example, when a Responder is registered on
   several devices (e.g., mobile phone, fixed phone, and computer) or
   when an invite is being made to addresses of the type

   IT-support@example.com, a group of users where only one is supposed
   to answer.  The Initiator may not even always know exactly who the
   authorized group members are.  To prevent all forms of eavesdropping,
   entities other than the endpoint that answers MUST NOT get access to
   the session keys.

   When key forking is not used, keys are accessible by everyone that
   can resolve the ticket.  When key forking is used, some keys (MPKr
   and TGKs encoded in the ticket) are modified, making them
   cryptographically unique for each responder targeted by the forking.
   As only the Initiator and the KMS have access to the master TGKs, it
   is infeasible for anyone else to derive the session keys.

   When key forking is used, some keys (MPKi and TEKs and GTGK encoded
   in the ticket) are still accessible by everyone that can resolve the
   ticket and should be used with this in mind.  This also concerns
   session keys transferred in a KEMAC in the first TRANSFER_INIT (as
   they are protected with MPKi).

   This protocol is resistant to denial-of-service attacks against the
   KMS in the sense that it does not construct any state (at the key
   management protocol level) before it has authenticated the Initiator
   or Responder.  Since the Responder, in general, cannot verify the
   validity of a TRANSFER_INIT message without first contacting the KMS,
   denial of service may be launched against the Responder and/or the
   KMS via the Responder.  Typical prevention methods such as rate-
   limiting and ACL (Access Control List) capability SHOULD therefore be
   implemented in the KMS as well as the clients.  If something in the
   signaling is suspicious, the Responder SHOULD abort before attempting
   a RESOLVE_INIT with the KMS.  The types and amount of prevention
   needed depends on how critical the system is and may vary depending
   on the Ticket Type.

   In a replay attack, an attacker may intercept and later retransmit
   the whole or part of a MIKEY message, attempting to trick the
   receiver (Responder or KMS) into undesired operations, e.g., leading
   to a lack of key freshness.  MIKEY-TICKET implements several
   mechanisms to prevent and detect such attacks.  Timestamps together
   with a replay cache efficiently stop the replay of entire MIKEY
   messages.  Parts of the received messages (or their hashes) can be
   saved in the replay cache until their timestamp is outdated.  To
   prevent replay attacks, the sender's (Initiator or Responder) and the
   receiver's (Responder or KMS) identity is always (explicitly or
   implicitly) included in the MAC/Signature calculation.

   An attacker may also attempt to replay a ticket by inserting it into
   a new MIKEY message.  A possible scenario is that Alice and Bob first
   communicate based on a ticket, which an attacker Mallory intercepts.
   Later, Mallory (acting as herself) invites Bob by inserting the
   ticket into her own TRANSFER_INIT message.  If key forking is used,
   such replays will always be detected when Bob has resolved the
   ticket.  If key forking is not used, such replays will be detected
   unless Mallory has knowledge of the MPKi.  And if Mallory has
   knowledge of the MPKi (i.e., she is authorized to resolve the ticket)
   and key forking is not used, there is no attack.  For the reasons
   explained above, it is RECOMMENDED to use key forking.

   In a group scenario, only authorized group members must have access
   to the keys.  In some situation, the communication may be initiated
   by the Initiator using a group identity and the Initiator may not
   even know exactly who the authorized group members are.  Moreover,
   group membership may change over time due to leaves/joins.  In such a
   situation, it is foremost the responsibility of the KMS to reject
   ticket resolution requests from unauthorized responders, implying
   that the KMS needs to be able to map an individual's identity
   (carried in the RESOLVE_INIT message) to group membership (where the
   group identity is carried in the ticket).

   As noted, reuse of tickets, which bypasses the KMS, is NOT
   RECOMMENDED when the Initiator is not fully ensured about group
   membership status.

   The MIKEY base ticket MAY be used in any of the modes described in
   <a href="#section-4.1.1">Section 4.1.1</a>.  The Ticket Data SHALL be constructed of MIKEY
   payloads and SHALL be protected by a MAC based on a pre-shared Ticket
   Protection Key (TPK).  The parties that shares the TPK depends on the
   mode.  Unexpected payloads in the Ticket Data SHOULD be ignored.

              Ticket Data = THDR, T, RAND, KEMAC, [IDRpsk], V

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/A.1.%20%20Components%20of%20the%20Ticket%20Data"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A.1" name="appendix-A.1">A.1</a>.  Components of the Ticket Data</span>

   The Ticket Data MUST always begin with a Ticket Header payload
   (THDR).  The ticket header is a new payload type; for the definition,
   see <a href="#appendix-A.3">Appendix A.3</a>.

   T is a timestamp containing the time of issue or a counter.  It MAY
   be used in the IV (Initialization Vector) formation (e.g., <a href="rfc3830.html#section-4.2.3">Section</a>
   <a href="rfc3830.html#section-4.2.3">4.2.3 of [RFC3830]</a>).

   RAND is used as input to the key derivation function when keys are
   derived from the TPK and the MPK (see Appendices A.2.1 and A.2.2).

   The KEMAC payload SHALL use the NULL authentication algorithm, as a
   MAC is included in the V payload.  The encryption key (encr_key) and
   salting key (salt_key) SHALL be derived from the TPK (see
   <a href="#appendix-A.2.1">Appendix A.2.1</a>).  Depending on the encryption algorithm, the salting
   key be used in the IV creation (see <a href="rfc3830.html#section-4.2.3">Section 4.2.3 of [RFC3830]</a>).  If
   CSB ID is needed in the IV creation it SHALL be set to '0xFFFFFFFF'.
   The KEMAC is hence constructed as follows:

                 KEMAC = E(encr_key, MPK || {TEK|TGK|GTGK})

   MPKi and MPKr are derived from the MPK as defined in <a href="#appendix-A.2.2">Appendix A.2.2</a>.

   IDRpsk contains an identifier that enables the KMS/Responder to
   retrieve the TPK.  It MAY be omitted when the TPK can be retrieved
   anyhow.

   The last payload SHALL be a Verification payload (V) where the
   authentication key (auth_key) is derived from the TPK.  The MAC SHALL
   be calculated over the entire TICKET payload except the Next Payload
   field (in the TICKET payload), the Initiator Data length field, the
   Initiator Data field, and the MAC field itself.

   In the following, we describe how keying material is derived from a
   TPK.  The key derivation method SHALL be executed using the PRF
   indicated in the Ticket Policy.  The parameters for the PRF are:

   inkey:     : TPK
   inkey_len  : bit length of the inkey
   label      : constant || 0xFF || 0xFFFFFFFF || 0x05 ||
                length RAND || RAND
   outkey_len : desired bit length of the outkey (encr_key,
                auth_key, salt_key)

   Length RAND is the length of RAND in bytes as an 8-bit unsigned
   integer.  The constants are as defined in <a href="rfc3830.html#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4 of [RFC3830]</a>.
   The key derivation and its dependencies on Ticket Data contents when
   AES-CM is used are illustrated in Figure 10.  The key derivation is
   done by the party that creates the ticket (KMS or Initiator) and by
   the party that resolves the ticket (KMS or Responder).  The
   encryption key and the IV are used to encrypt the KEMAC.

   MPK in the KEMAC payload.  The key derivation method SHALL be
   executed using the PRF indicated in the Ticket Policy.  The
   parameters for the PRF are:

   inkey:     : MPK
   inkey_len  : bit length of the inkey
   label      : constant || 0xFF || 0xFFFFFFFF || 0x06 ||
                length RAND || RAND
   outkey_len : desired bit length of the outkey (MPKi, MPKr)
                SHALL be equal to inkey_len

   Length RAND is the length of RAND in bytes as an 8-bit unsigned
   integer.  The constant depends on the derived key type as summarized
   below.

                          Derived key | Constant
                          ------------+-----------
                          MPKi        | 0x220E99A2
                          MPKr        | 0x1F4D675B

                Table A.1: Constants for MPK key derivation

   The constants are taken from the decimal digits of e as described in
   [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>].

   The ticket header payload contains an indicator of the next payload
   as well as implementation-specific data.

   *  Next Payload (8 bits): identifies the payload that is added after
      this payload.

   *  THDR Data length (16 bits): the length of the THDR Data field (in
      bytes).

   *  THDR Data (variable length): implementation specific data that
      SHOULD be ignored if it is not expected.

   MIKEY-TICKET can be used to define a Ticket Type compatible with
   [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>] or any other half-round-trip key management protocol.  The
   Initiator requests and gets a ticket from the KMS where the Ticket
   Data is a [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>] message protected with a pre-shared key
   (KMS-Responder) or with the Responder's certificate.  The Ticket Data
   is then sent to the Responder according to [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>].  In this way,
   the Initiator can communicate with a Responder that only supports
   [<a href="rfc3830.html" title='"MIKEY: Multimedia Internet KEYing"'>RFC3830</a>] and with whom the Initiator do not have any shared
   credentials.
