Abstract

   This document is a proposal to add a new event/signal package to the
   MGCP (Media Gateway Control Protocol) protocol to control an ARF
   (Audio Resource Function) which may reside on a Media Gateway or
   specialized Audio Server.

   This event package provides support for the standard IVR (Interactive
   Voice Response) operations of PlayAnnouncement, PlayCollect, and
   PlayRecord.  It supports direct references to simple audio as well as
   indirect references to simple and complex audio. It provides audio
   variables, control of audio interruptibility, digit buffer control,
   special key sequences, and support for reprompting during data
   collection.  It also provides an arbitrary number of user defined
   qualifiers to be used in resolving complex audio structures.  For
   example, the user could define qualifiers for any or all of the
   following: language, accent, audio file format, gender, speaker, or
   customer.

   The following syntax supports both simple and complex audio
   structures.  A simple audio structure might be a single announcement
   such as "Welcome to Bell South's Automated Directory Assistance
   Service".  A more complex audio structure might consist of an
   announcement followed by voice variable followed by another
   announcement, for example "There are thirty seven minutes remaining
   on your prepaid calling card," where "There are" is a prompt, the
   number of minutes is a voice variable, and "minutes remaining on your
   prepaid calling card" is another prompt.

   It is also possible to define complex audio structures that are
   qualified by user defined selectors such as language, audio file
   format, gender, accent, customer, or voice talent.  For instance, if
   the above example were qualified by language and accent selectors, it
   would be possible to play "There are thirty seven minutes remaining
   on your prepaid calling card" in English spoken with a southern
   accent or in English spoken with a mid-western accent, providing that
   the audio to support this had been provisioned.

   There are two methods of specifying complex audio.  The first is to
   directly reference the individual components.  This requires a
   complete description of each component to be specified via the
   protocol.  The second method is to provision the components on the
   Audio Server as a single entity and to export a reference to that
   entity to the call agent.  In this case, only the reference (plus any

   dynamic data required, such as a variable data) is passed via the
   protocol, and no specification of individual components is necessary.

   The Audio Server Package provides significant functionality most of
   which is controlled via protocol parameters.  Most parameters are
   optional, and where ever possible default to reasonable values.  An
   audio application that references to provisioned, complex audio
   structures, and which takes advantage of parameter optionality and
   defaults, can specify audio events using a minimum of syntax.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Background"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Background</span>

   The next two sections contain background information which may be
   helpful in understanding the syntax.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.1.%20%20Sequence%20And%20Sets"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1.1" name="section-1.1.1">1.1.1</a>.  Sequence And Sets</span>

   The syntax supports abstractions of set and sequence for storing and
   referencing audio data.

   A sequence is a provisioned sequence of one or more audio segments.
   Component segments are not necessarily all of the same type.  Every
   sequence is assigned a unique segment id.  On playback, a sequence id
   reference is deconstructed into its individual parts, each of which
   is played in order.

   A set is a provisioned collection of audio segments with an
   associated selector.  On playback, the selector value is resolved to
   a particular set element.  Selector types are supported by the
   syntax, but individual selector types are not defined in the syntax
   except for the pre-defined language selector; they are instead
   defined by the user (i.e.  provisioner).  A user could define one or
   more of the following selector types: language, accent, audio file
   format, gender, accent, customer, or day of the week.  For each
   selector type, the user must define a range of valid values.  The
   user may also choose to define a default value.  At runtime if a
   selector value is not supplied the default value is used.

   For example, to support an application which plays a particular piece
   of audio in either English, French, or Russian, a provisioner would
   define a set with the pre-defined selector, "Lang", and would define
   three possible values for that selector, "eng", "fra", and "rus".
   The provisioner would then provision three recordings of the prompt,
   one in each language, and would associate the French recording with
   the "fra" selector value, etc.  The provisioner also could define a
   default value of the selector when no selector value is supplied,
   "eng" for instance.  The entire set would be assigned a unique
   segment id.

   At runtime a reference to the set with the selector set to "rus"
   would result in the Russian version of the prompt being played.  A
   reference to the set with no selector would result in the English
   version of the prompt being played since English has been set as the
   default selector value.

   Nested definition of both sets and sequences is allowed, i.e. it
   legal to define a set of sets or a sequence of sequences.  In
   addition, audio structures may also be specified by intermixing sets
   and sequences, and it is possible to specify a set of sequences or a
   sequence containing one or more set elements.  Direct or transitive
   definition of a set or segment in terms of itself is not allowed.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.2.%20%20Segment%20Types"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1.2" name="section-1.1.2">1.1.2</a>.  Segment Types</span>

   The syntax supports the following segment types:

      RECORDING:  A reference by unique id to a single piece of recorded
      audio.

      RECORDINGs may be provisioned or they may be made during the
      course of a call.  A RECORDING made during the course of a call
      can be temporary or persistent.  A temporary RECORDING lasts only
      for the life of the call during which it was recorded.  A
      persistent RECORDING lasts beyond the live of the call during
      which it was recorded.

      A provisioned RECORDING may be replaced (or overridden) by a
      persistent RECORDING.  A reference to the id of the provisioned
      RECORDING will then resolve to the persistent RECORDING.  The
      overriding persistent audio can subsequently be deleted and the
      original provisioned audio can be restored.

      A provisioned RECORDING may be overridden more than once.  In this
      case, the id of the provisioned RECORDING refers to the latest
      overriding RECORDING.  When the overriding RECORDING is deleted,
      the original provisioned RECORDING is restored, even if the
      segment has been overridden multiple times.

      TEXT:  A reference to a block of text to be converted to speech or
      to be displayed on a device. Reference may be by unique id to a
      block of provisioned text or by direct specification of text in a
      parameter.

      SILENCE:  A specification of a length of silence to be played in

      TONE: The specification of a tone to be played by algorithmic
      generation.  Most tones however will probably be recorded, not
      generated. Exact specification of this segment type is tbd.

      VARIABLE:  The specification of a voice variable by the parameters
      of type, subtype, and value.  Specification of variables is
      considered in more detail in a subsequent section of this
      document.

      SEQUENCE: A reference by unique id to a provisioned sequence of
      mixed RECORDING, TEXT, SILENCE, TONE, VARIABLE, SET, or SEQUENCE
      segments. Nested definition of SEQUENCE segments is allowed.
      Direct or transitive definition of a SEQUENCE segment in terms of
      itself is not allowed.

      SET:  A  reference by unique id to a provisioned set of segments.
      The intended and recommended use of the SET type is that all
      segments in the set should be semantically equivalent, however
      there is no real way of enforcing this restriction either in the
      protocol or in provisioning.  Every set has an associated selector
      which is used at runtime to resolve the set reference to a
      specific element of the set.  The elements of a set may one of the
      following segment types:  RECORDING, TEXT, TONE, SILENCE,
      SEQUENCE, or SET.  Specific selector types are not specified by
      the protocol and must be defined by the user.  Nested definition
      of SET segments is allowed. Direct or transitive definition of a
      SET segment in terms of itself is not allowed.

   The events provided by the AS Package are defined as follows:

   PlayAnnouncement:
      Plays an announcement in situations where there is no need for
      interaction with the user.  Because there is no need to monitor
      the incoming media stream this event is an efficient mechanism for
      treatments, informational announcements, etc.

   PlayCollect:
      Plays a prompt and collects DTMF digits entered by a user.  If no
      digits are entered or an invalid digit pattern is entered, the
      user may be reprompted and given another chance to enter a correct
      pattern of digits.  The following digits are supported:  0-9, *,
      #, A, B, C, D.  By default PlayCollect does not play an initial
      prompt, makes only one attempt to collect digits, and therefore
      functions as a simple Collect operation.  Various special purpose
      keys, key sequences, and key sets can be defined for use during
      the PlayCollect operation.

   PlayRecord:
      Plays a prompt and records user speech.  If the user does not
      speak, the user may be reprompted and given another chance to
      record.  By default PlayRecord does not play an initial prompt,
      makes only one attempt to record, and therefore functions as a
      simple Record operation.

   OperationComplete:
      Detected upon the successful completion of a Play, PlayRecord, or
      Play Collect signal.

   OperationFailed:
      Detected upon the failure of a Play, PlayRecord, or PlayCollect
      signal.

   EndSignal:
      Gracefully terminates a Play, PlayCollect, or PlayRecord signal.
      For each of these signals, if the signal is terminated with the
      EndSignal signal the resulting OperationComplete event or
      OperationFailed event will contain all the parameters it would
      normally, including any collected digits or the recording id of
      the recording that was in progress when the EndSignal signal was
      received.

   If an Advanced Audio Package signal is active on an endpoint and
   another signal of the same type is applied, the two signals including
   parameters and parameter values will compared  If the signals are
   identical, the signal in progress will be allowed to continue and the
   new signal will be discarded. Because of this behavior the Advanced
   Audio Package may not interoperate well with some other packages such
   as the Line and Trunk packages.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.%20%20Parameters"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" name="section-5">5</a>.  Parameters</span>

   The PlayAnnouncement, PlayRecord, and PlayCollect events may each be
   qualified by a string of parameters, most of which are optional.
   Where appropriate,  parameters default to reasonable values.  The
   only event with a required parameter is PlayAnnouncement.  If a
   Play-Announcement event is not provided with a parameter specifying
   some form of playable audio an error is returned to the application.

   Parameters to the Advanced Audio Package events are defined as
   follows:

   Announcement:

      An announcement to be played.  Consists of one or more audio
      segments.

   Initial Prompt:

      The initial announcement prompting the user to either enter DTMF
      digits or to speak.  Consists of one or more audio segments.  If
      not specified (the default), the event immediately begins digit
      collection or recording.

   Reprompt:

      Played after the user has made an error such as entering an
      invalid digit pattern or not speaking.  Consists of one or more
      audio segments.  Defaults to the Initial Prompt.

   No Digits Reprompt:

      Played after the user has failed to enter a valid digit pattern
      during a PlayCollect event.  Consists of one or more audio
      segments.  Defaults to the Reprompt.

   No Speech Reprompt:

      Played after the user has failed to speak during a PlayRecord
      event.  Consists of one or more audio segments.  Defaults to the
      Reprompt.

   Failure Announcement:

      Played when all data entry attempts have failed.  Consists of one
      or more audio segments.  No default.

   Success Announcement:

      Played when data collection has succeeded.  Consists of one or
      more audio segments.  No default.

   Non-Interruptible Play:

      If set to true, initial prompt is not interruptible by either
      voice or digits.  Defaults to false.  Valid values are the text
      strings "true" and "false".

   Iterations:

      The maximum number of times an announcement is to be played.  A
      value of minus one (-1) indicates the announcement is to be
      repeated forever. Defaults to one (1).

   Interval:

      The interval of silence to be inserted between iterative plays.
      Specified in units of 100 milliseconds.  Defaults to 10 (1
      second).

   Duration:

      The maximum amount of time to play and possibly replay an
      announcement. Takes precedence over iteration and interval.
      Specified in units of 100 milliseconds.  No default.

   Speed:

      The relative playback speed of announcement specifiable as a
      positive or negative percentage of the original playback speed.

   Volume:

      The relative playback volume of announcement specifiable as a
      positive or negative decibel variation from the original play-back
      volume.

   Clear Digit Buffer:

      If set to true, clears the digit buffer before playing the initial
      prompt.  Defaults to false.  Valid values are the text strings
      "true" and "false".

   Maximum # Of Digits:

      The maximum number of digits to collect.  Defaults to one.  This
      parameter should not be specified if the Digit Pattern parameter
      is present.

   Minimum # Of Digits:

      The minimum number of digits to collect.  Defaults to one.  This
      parameter should not be specified if the Digit Pattern parameter
      is present.

   Digit Pattern:

      A legal digit map as described in <a href="#section-7.1.14">section 7.1.14</a> of the Megaco
      protocol [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Megaco Protocol"'>6</a>] using the DTMF mappings associated with the Megaco
      DTMF Detection Package described in the Megaco protocol document

      [<a href="#ref-6" title='"Megaco Protocol"'>6</a>].  This parameter should not be specified if one or both of the
      Minimum # Of Digits parameter and the Maximum Number Of Digits
      parameter is present.

   First Digit Timer:

      The amount of time allowed for the user to enter the first digit.
      Specified in units of 100 milliseconds.  50 (5 seconds).

   Inter Digit Timer:

      The amount of time allowed for the user to enter each subsequent
      digit. Specified units of 100 milliseconds seconds.  Defaults to
      30 (3 seconds).

   Extra Digit Timer:

      The amount of time to wait for a user to enter a final digit once
      the maximum expected amount of digits have been entered.
      Typically this timer is used to wait for a terminating key in
      applications where a specific key has been defined to terminate
      input.  Specified in units of 100 milliseconds. If not specified,
      this timer is not activated.

   Pre-speech Timer:

      The amount of time to wait for the user to initially speak.
      Specified in units of 100 milliseconds.  Defaults to 30 (3
      seconds).

   Post-speech Timer:

      The amount of silence necessary after the end of the last speech
      segment for the recording to be considered complete.  Specified in
      units of 100 milliseconds.  Defaults to 20 (2 seconds).

   Recording Length Timer:

      The maximum allowable length of the recording, not including pre
      or post speech silence.  Specified in units of 100 milliseconds.
      This parameter is mandatory.

   Restart Key:

      Defines a key sequence consisting of a command key optionally
      followed by zero or more keys.  This key sequence has the
      following action:  discard any digits collected or recording in
      progress, replay the prompt, and resume digit collection or

      recording.  No default.  An application that defines more than one
      command key sequence, will typically use the same command key for
      all command key sequences.  If more than one command key sequence
      is defined, then all key sequences must consist of a command key
      plus at least one other key.

   Reinput Key:

      Defines a key sequence consisting of a command key optionally
      followed by zero or more keys.  This key sequence has the
      following action: discard any digits collected or recordings in
      progress and resume digit collection or recording. No default.  An
      application that defines more than one command key sequence, will
      typically use the same command key for all command key sequences.
      If more than one command key sequence is defined, then all key
      sequences must consist of a command key plus at least one other
      key.

   Return Key:

      Defines a key sequence consisting of a command key optionally
      followed by zero or more keys.  This key sequence has the
      following action:  terminate the current event and any queued
      event and return the terminating key sequence to the call
      processing agent.  No default.   An application that defines more
      than one command key sequence, will typically use the same command
      key for all command key sequences.  If more than one command key
      sequence is defined, then all key sequences must consist of a
      command key plus at least one other key.

   Position Key:

      Defines a key with the following action.  Stop playing the current
      announcement and resume playing at the beginning of the first,
      last, previous, next, or the current segment of the announcement.
      No default.  The actions for the position key are fst, lst, prv,
      nxt, and cur.

   Stop Key:

      Defines a key with the following action.  Terminate playback of
      the announcement.  No default.

   Start Input Keys:

      Defines a set of keys that are acceptable as the first digit
      collected. This set of keys can be specified to interrupt a
      playing announcement or to not interrupt a playing announcement.

      The default key set is 0-9. The default behavior is to interrupt a
      playing announcement when a Start Input Key is pressed.  This
      behavior can be overidden for the initial prompt only by using the
      ni (Non-Interruptible Play) parameter.  Specification is a list of
      keys with no separators, e.g.  123456789#.

   End Input Key:

      Specifies a key that signals the end of digit collection or voice
      recording. The default end input key is the # key. To specify that
      no End Input Key be used the parameter is set to the string
      "null".  The default behavior not to return the End Input Key in
      the digits returned to the call agent.  This behavior can be
      overidden by the Include End Input Key (eik) parameter.

   Include End Input Key:

      By default the End Input Key is not included in the collected
      digits returned to the call agent.  If this parameter is set to
      "true" then the End Input Key will be returned with the collected
      digits returned to the call agent.  Default is "false".

   Number Of Attempts:

      The number of attempts the user needed to enter a valid digit
      pattern or to make a recording.  Defaults to 1.  Also used as a
      return parameter to indicate the number of attempts the user made.

   Record Persistent Audio:

      If set to true, the recording that is made is persistent instead
      of temporary.  Defaults to false.  Valid values are the text
      strings "true" and "false".

   Delete Persistent Audio

      Indicates that the specified persistent audio segment is to be
      deleted. This parameter is carried by the PlayRecord event,
      although nothing is either played or recorded in this case.

   Override Audio:

      Indicates that the specified provisioned audio segment is to be
      overridden with a persistent audio segment to be recorded in the
      PlayRecord operation that carries this parameter.

   Restore Audio:

      Indicates that the provisioned audio segment originally associated
      with the specified segment id is to be restored and that the
      overriding persistent audio is to be deleted.  This parameter is
      carried by the PlayRecord event, although nothing is either played

   Tone:

      Specifies a tone to be played by algorithmic generation.  Exact
      specification of this parameter is tbd.  Most tones will likely be
      recorded, not generated.

   Variable:

      Specifies a voice variable by type, subtype, and value.  Variables
      are more completely defined in a subsequent section of the
      document.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/8.%20%20Variables"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-8" name="section-8">8</a>.  Variables</span>

   The syntax supports two kinds of variables.  Embedded embedded
   variables are variables that have been provisioned as part of a
   segment.  Standalone variables are completely specified in the
   protocol message.

   Typically embedded variables are provisioned along with recorded
   speech, e.g. "A representative will be with you in approximately 5
   minutes.  If you would prefer to leave a voice message, press 1 now".
   where the variable is the number of minutes. This kind of variable is
   often referred to as an embedded variable.

   Variables are specified by the following parameters: type, subtype,
   and value.  Variable types include Date, Money, Number, Time, etc.
   Subtype is a refinement of type.  For example the variable type Money
   might have an associated range of subtypes such as Dollar, Rupee,
   Dinar, etc.  Not all variables require a subtype, and for these
   variables the subtype parameter should be set to null.

   For embedded variables, the type and subtype must be provisioned.
   The value may be provisioned.  If it is not provisioned it must be
   specified as part of the variable reference.  In a list of segments,
   an embedded variable value specification applies only to the segment
   that directly precedes it.  If a segment has multiple embedded
   variables, the values must be given in the order in which the
   variables are encountered when the segment is played.

   Some examples follow below:

   A standalone variable:

      S: pa(an=vb(mny,usd,1153))






<span class="grey">Cromwell                     Informational                     [Page 18]</span></pre>

   An embedded variable:

      S: pa(an=37&lt;1153&gt;)

   Not all variables, such as the date variable shown in the next
   example, require a subtype.  In that case, the subtype is encoded
   with the value "null":

      S: pa(an=vb(dat,null,101598))

   In some cases it may be desirable to play an announcement that
   contains an embedded variable without playing the variable itself.
   To do this a single "null" is provided for the value:

      S: pa(an=37&lt;null&gt;)

   Date:

      Speaks a date specified as YYYYMMDD (per ISO 8601, International
      Date and Time Notation [<a href="#ref-7" title='"International Date and Time Notation"'>7</a>]).  For example "19981015" is spoken as
      "October fifteenth nineteen ninety eight".

   Digits:

      Speaks a string of digits one at a time.  If the subtype is North
      American DN, the format of which is NPA-NXX-XXXX, the digits are
      spoken with appropriate pauses between the NPA and NXX and between
      the NXX and XXXX.  If the subtype is generic, the digits are
      spoken no pauses.

   Duration:

      Duration is specified in seconds and is spoken in one or more
      units of time as appropriate, e.g. "3661" is spoken as "One hour,
      one minute, and one second".

   Money:

      Money is specified in the smallest units of a given currency and
      is spoken in one or more units of currency as appropriate, e.g.
      "110" in U.S. Dollars would be spoken "one dollar and ten cents".
      The three letter codes defined in ISO 4217, Currency And Funds
      Code List [<a href="#ref-5" title='"Currency And Funds Code List"'>5</a>] are used to specify the currency subtype. A small

      Money can be specified in negative or positive units of currency.
      In the above example "-110" would be spoken as "minus one dollar
      and ten cents".

   Month:

      Speaks the specified month, e.g. "10" is spoken as "October".
      Specification is in MM format with "01" denoting January, "02"
      denoting February, etc.

   Number:

      Speaks a number in cardinal form or in ordinal form.  For example,
      "100" is spoken as "one hundred" in cardinal form and "one
      hundredth" in ordinal form.  Cardinal numbers can be specified as
      negative or positive.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20%20Selectors"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>.  Selectors</span>

   Selector types, except for the pre-defined "Lang" (language)
   selector, are definable by the user and may be applied to an
   individual segment within an operation or to all the segments in an
   operation.  For each selector type, the user must also define a range
   of values that the selector can assume.

   For example, if the user defines a selector of type "phase-of-the-
   moon", he might also define the legal values for that selector to be
   "new", "half", "full", "harvest", and "blue".  For the selector to
   actually work at runtime, audio associated with each of the selector
   values must be provisioned.

   Although not required, it is suggested that the three letter codes
   defined in ISO standard 639-2, Code For The Representation Of Names
   Of Languages [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Code For The Representation Of Names Of Languages"'>4</a>] be used as values for user defined language
   selectors.  A small excerpt from ISO 639-2 follows:

                             _________________
                             |Code | Language |
                             |_____|__________|
                             |cze  | Czech    |
                             |cym  | Welsh    |
                             |dan  | Danish   |
                             |_____|__________|

   Selectors can apply to entire operations or to a segment within an
   operation.  If an operation contains multiple segments, each segment
   may have its own set of selectors. If selectors for an individual
   segment and selectors for the entire operation are present, the
   selector for the individual segment takes precedence for that
   segment.  The selectors for the operation apply to all segments
   within that operation that do not have individual segment selectors.
   If a selector set is not specified, provisioned defaults are used.

   Selectors are applied to variables only after the variable has been
   resolved. For instance if a date variable resolved to "October 15th,
   1998" the voice with which the variable is spoken could resolve to
   either male or female if a gender selector had been defined.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/10.%20%20Aliases"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-10" name="section-10">10</a>.  Aliases</span>

   Aliasing of audio segments is supported.  The alias to segment id
   mapping is provisioned and at runtime the alias is resolved to its
   associated segment id. The syntax for an alias is inclusion of the
   alias between two forward slashes, e.g.:

      S: pa(an=/not-in-service/)

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/11.%20%20Examples"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-11" name="section-11">11</a>.  Examples</span>

   This section presents a number of examples of how the syntax is used.
   Note that arguments to an event are separated by a one or more
   whitespace characters, which can be either an ASCII space character
   or an ASCII tabulation character.

   Play an announcement that consists of a single segment:

      S: pa(an=39)

   Play an announcement that consists of multiple segments:

      S: pa(an=39,40,47)

   Play an announcement that consists of a recording followed by silence
   followed by text to speech followed by a standalone voice variable:

      S: pa(an=39 si(30) ts(hello) vb(my,usd,3999))

   Play an announcement with an embedded variable.  If the first three
   segments of the previous announcement were provisioned as segment 40,
   the following would be exactly equivalent to the play in the
   preceding example:

      S: pa(an=40&lt;3999&gt;)

   Play an announcement with two embedded variables:

      S: pa(an=113&lt;3999,10151998&gt;)

   Play a prompt and collect a single digit.  If need be, play a
   reprompt, a no digits prompt, and a success or failure announcement.
   Give the user three attempts to enter a digit:

      S: pc(ip=21 rp=109 nd=102 fa=81 sa=72 na=3)

   Play a prompt and collect a single digit.  If the user does not enter
   a digit replay the initial prompt.  Give the user three attempts to
   enter a digit:

      S: pc(ip=21 na=3)

   Play a prompt and record voice.  If the user does not speak play a no
   speech prompt.  Give the user two attempts to record:

      S: pr(ip=22 ns=42 na=2)

   Play an announcement at ninety percent of its original speed and five
   decibels softer than its original volume.  Play the announcement
   three times with two seconds of silence between plays.

      S: pa(an=27 sp=90 vl=-5 it=3 iv=20)

   Give the user two attempts to enter a three digit pattern.  Clear the
   digit buffer before playing the prompt. The user can signal end of
   input using the # key, which is not returned to the call agent with
   the collected digits.

      S: pc(ip=43 cb=true mn=3 mx=3 na=2)

   Give the user three attempts to enter a three digit pattern.  If the
   user enters one digits or two digits on the first or second attempts
   a reprompt is played.  If the user enters no digits on the first or
   second attempts a no digits reprompt is played.  If all three
   attempts fail, a failure announcement is played.  If one of the
   attempts is successful, a success announcement is played and the
   collected digits are returned to the call agent.  The user can signal
   end of input using the # key.  If the # key terminates a successful
   input attempt, the collected digits, but not the # key, are returned
   to the call agent.

      S: pc(ip=87 rp=5 nd=409 fa=9 sa=18 mx=3 na=3)

   Give the user a single attempt to enter a a 1 to 4 digit pattern,
   allow 8 seconds for the user to enter the first digit, and allow 6
   seconds for the user to enter each subsequent digit.  If the
   subsequent digit timer expires after the user has less than four
   digits, the digits collected are returned to the call agent.  The
   user can signal end of input using the # key which is not returned to
   the call agent with the collected digits.

      S: pc(ip=4 fdt=80 idt=60 mx=4)

   Give the user three chances to enter an 11 digit number that begins
   with 0 or 1.  If the user makes a mistake while entering digits, he
   can press the * key to discard any digits already collected, replay
   the prompt, and resume collection.

      S: pc(ip=33 mn=11 mx=11 sik=01 rsk=* na=3)

   Give the user three chances to enter an 11 digit number that begins
   with 0 or 1.  If the user makes a mistake while entering digits, he
   can press the key sequence *11 to discard any digits already
   collected, replay the prompt, and resume collection.  If the user
   enters the key sequence *12 the play collect is terminated along with
   any queued events, and the terminating key sequence is returned to
   the call agent for processing.

      S: pc(ip=33 mn=11 mx=11 sik=01 rsk=*11 rtk=*12 na=3)

   Give the user two chances to make a recording.  After playing the
   prompt, wait 5 seconds for the user to speak, otherwise replay the
   initial prompt and try again.  If the user does speak, wait for seven
   seconds after speech stops to make sure the user is finished.  If the
   recording is successful, return a reference to the recording to the
   call agent.

   selector applies to the an segment; in the second it applies to the
   pa operation.  For these particular examples, the net effect is the
   same.

      S: pa(an=5[Lang=eng])    or    S: pa(an=5)[Lang=eng]

   Play an announcement in Danish using a female voice with a Cajun
   accent.

      S: pa(an=6)[Lang=dan,gender=female,accent=cajun]
