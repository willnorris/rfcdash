   This document specifies an extension of OSPFv3 [<a href="rfc5340.html" title='"OSPF for IPv6"'>RFC5340</a>] that is
   adapted to mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) [<a href="rfc2501.html" title='"Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET): Routing Protocol Performance Issues and Evaluation Considerations"'>RFC2501</a>] and based on
   mechanisms providing:

   Flooding-reduction:  only a subset of all routers will be involved in
      (re)transmissions during a flooding operation.

   Topology-reduction:  only a subset of links are advertised, hence
      both the number and the size of Link State Advertisements (LSAs)
      are decreased.

   Adjacency-reduction:  adjacencies are brought up only with a subset
      of neighbors for lower database synchronization overhead.

   These mechanisms are based on multipoint relays (MPR), a technique
   developed in the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)
   [<a href="rfc3626.html" title='"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)"'>RFC3626</a>].

   The extension specified in this document integrates into the OSPF
   framework by defining the OSPFv3 MANET interface type.  While this
   extension enables OSPFv3 to function efficiently on mobile ad hoc
   networks, operation of OSPFv3 on other types of interfaces or
   networks, or in areas without OSPFv3 MANET interfaces, remains
   unaltered.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

   This document uses OSPF terminology as defined in [<a href="rfc2328.html" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>RFC2328</a>] and
   [<a href="rfc5340.html" title='"OSPF for IPv6"'>RFC5340</a>], and Link-Local Signaling (LLS) terminology as defined in
   [<a href="rfc4813.html" title='"OSPF Link-Local Signaling"'>RFC4813</a>]; it introduces the following terminology to the OSPF
   nomenclature:

   OSPFv3 MANET interface  - the OSPFv3 interface type for MANETs, as
      specified in this document.

   Additionally, the following terms are used in this document:

   MANET router -  a router that has only OSPFv3 MANET interfaces.

   Wired router -  a router that has only OSPFv3 interface of types
      other than OSPFv3 MANET interfaces.

   Hybrid router -  a router that has OSPFv3 interfaces of several
      types, including at least one of the OSPFv3 MANET interface type.

      equal to 2-Way (through an interface of any type).

   Symmetric strict 2-hop neighbor -  a symmetric 1-hop neighbor of a
      symmetric 1-hop neighbor, which is not itself a symmetric 1-hop
      neighbor of the considered router.

   Symmetric strict 2-hop neighborhood -  the set formed by all the
      symmetric strict 2-hop neighbors of the considered router.

   Synch router -  a router that brings up adjacencies with all of its
      MANET neighbors.

   Flooding-MPR -  a router that is selected by its symmetric 1-hop
      neighbor, router X, to retransmit all broadcast protocol packets
      that it receives from router X, provided that the broadcast
      protocol packet is not a duplicate and that the Hop Limit field of
      the protocol packet is greater than one.

   Path-MPR -  a router that is selected by a symmetric 1-hop neighbor,
      X, as being on the shortest path from a router in the symmetric
      strict 2-hop neighborhood of router X to router X.

   Multipoint relay (MPR) -  a router that is selected by its symmetric
      1-hop neighbor as either a Flooding-MPR, a Path-MPR, or both.

   Flooding-MPR-selector -  a router that has selected its symmetric
      1-hop neighbor, router X, as one of its Flooding-MPRs is a
      Flooding-MPR-selector of router X.

   Path-MPR-selector -  a router that has selected its symmetric 1-hop
      neighbor, router X, as one of its Path-MPRs is a Path-MPR selector
      of router X.

   MPR-selector -  a router that has selected its symmetric 1-hop

   The OSPFv3 MANET interface type, defined in this specification,
   allows OSPFv3 to be deployed within an area where parts of that area
   are a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) with moderate mobility
   properties.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20MANET%20Characteristics"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  MANET Characteristics</span>

   MANETs [<a href="rfc2501.html" title='"Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET): Routing Protocol Performance Issues and Evaluation Considerations"'>RFC2501</a>] are networks in which a dynamic network topology is
   a frequently expected condition, often due to router mobility and/or
   to varying quality of wireless links -- the latter of which also
   generally entails bandwidth scarcity and interference issues between
   neighbors.

   Moreover, MANETs often exhibit "semi-broadcast" properties, i.e., a
   router R that makes a transmission within a MANET can only assume
   that transmission to be received by a subset of the total number of
   routers within that MANET.  Further, if two routers, R1 and R2, each
   make a transmission, neither of these transmissions is guaranteed to
   be received by the same subset of routers within the MANET -- even if
   R1 and R2 can mutually receive transmissions from each other.

   These characteristics are incompatible with several OSPFv3
   mechanisms, including, but not limited to, existing mechanisms for
   control-traffic reduction, such as flooding-reduction, topology-
   reduction, and adjacency-reduction (e.g., Designated Router).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.2.%20%20OSPFv3%20MANET%20Interface%20Characteristics"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.2" name="section-3.2">3.2</a>.  OSPFv3 MANET Interface Characteristics</span>

   An interface of the OSPFv3 MANET interface type is the point of
   attachment of an OSPFv3 router to a network that may have MANET
   characteristics.  That is, an interface of the OSPFv3 MANET interface
   type is able to accommodate the MANET characteristics described in
   <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>.  An OSPFv3 MANET interface type is not prescribing a set
   of behaviors or expectations that the network is required to satisfy.
   Rather, it is describing operating conditions under which protocols
   on an interface towards that network must be able to function (i.e.,
   the protocols are required to be able to operate correctly when faced
   with the characteristics described in <a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>).  As such, the

   OSPFv3 MANET interface type is a generalization of other OSPFv3
   interface types; for example, a protocol operating correctly over an
   OSPFv3 MANET interface would also operate correctly over an OSPFv3
   broadcast interface (whereas the inverse would not necessarily be
   true).

   Efficient OSPFv3 operation over MANETs relies on control-traffic
   reduction and on using mechanisms appropriate for semi-broadcast.
   The OSPFv3 MANET interface type, defined in this document, allows
   networks with MANET characteristics into the OSPFv3 framework by
   integrating mechanisms (flooding-reduction, topology-reduction, and
   adjacency-reduction) derived from solutions standardized by the MANET
   working group.

   The OSPFv3 MANET interface type, defined in this specification, makes
   use of flooding-reduction, topology-reduction, and adjacency-
   reduction, all based on MPR, a technique derived from [<a href="rfc3626.html" title='"Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)"'>RFC3626</a>], as
   standardized in the MANET working group.  Multicast transmissions of
   protocol packets are used when possible.

   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces use a flooding-reduction mechanism, denoted
   MPR flooding [<a href="#ref-MPR" title='"Multipoint Relaying for Flooding Broadcast Messages in Mobile Wireless Networks"'>MPR</a>], whereby only a subset of MANET neighbors (those
   selected as Flooding-MPR) participate in a flooding operation.  This
   reduces the number of (re)transmissions necessary for a flooding
   operation [<a href="#ref-MPR-analysis" title='"Analysis of MPR Selection in the OLSR Protocol"'>MPR-analysis</a>], while retaining resilience against
   transmission errors (inherent when using wireless links) and against
   obsolete two-hop neighbor information (e.g., as caused by router
   mobility) [<a href="#ref-MPR-robustness" title='"On the Robustness and Stability of Connected Dominated Sets"'>MPR-robustness</a>].

   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces use a topology-reduction mechanism, denoted
   MPR topology-reduction, whereby only necessary links to MANET
   neighbors (those identified by Path-MPR selection as belonging to
   shortest paths) are included in LSAs.  Routers in a MANET
   periodically generate and flood Router-LSAs describing their
   selection of such links to their Path-MPRs.  Such links are reported
   as point-to-point links.  This reduces the size of LSAs originated by
   routers on a MANET [<a href="#ref-MPR-topology" title='"Partial Topology in an MPR-based Solution for Wireless OSPF on Mobile Ad Hoc Networks"'>MPR-topology</a>], while retaining classic OSPF
   properties: optimal paths using synchronized adjacencies (if
   synchronized paths are preferred over non-synchronized paths of equal
   cost).

   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces employ multicast transmissions when possible,
   thereby taking advantage of inherent broadcast capabilities of the
   medium, if present (with wireless interfaces, this can often be the
   case [<a href="rfc2501.html" title='"Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET): Routing Protocol Performance Issues and Evaluation Considerations"'>RFC2501</a>]).  In particular, LSA acknowledgments are sent via
   multicast over these interfaces, and retransmissions over the same
   interfaces are considered as implicit acknowledgments.  Jitter
   management, such as delaying packet (re)transmission, can be employed
   in order to allow several packets to be bundled into a single
   transmission, which may avoid superfluous retransmissions due to
   packet collisions [<a href="rfc5148.html" title='"Jitter Considerations in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5148</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.%20%20MPR%20Adjacency-Reduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4" name="section-4.4">4.4</a>.  MPR Adjacency-Reduction</span>

   Adjacencies over OSPFv3 MANET interfaces are required to be formed
   only with a subset of the neighbors of that OSPFv3 MANET interface.
   No Designated Router or Backup Designated Router are elected on an
   OSPFv3 MANET interface.  Rather, adjacencies are brought up over an
   OSPFv3 MANET interface only with MPRs and MPR selectors.  Only a
   small subset of routers in the MANET (called Synch routers) are
   required to bring up adjacencies with all their MANET neighbors.
   This reduces the amount of control traffic needed for database
   synchronization, while ensuring that LSAs still describe only
   synchronized adjacencies.

   Hello packets sent over an OSPFv3 MANET interface MUST have the L bit
   of the OSPF Options field set, as per [<a href="rfc4813.html" title='"OSPF Link-Local Signaling"'>RFC4813</a>], indicating the
   presence of an LLS block.

   This document defines and employs the following TLVs in Hello packets
   sent over OSPFv3 MANET interfaces:

   FMPR -  signaling Flooding-MPR selection;

   PMPR -  signaling Path-MPR selection;

   METRIC-MPR -  signaling metrics.

   The layout and internal structure of these TLVs is detailed in
   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>.

   The objective of Flooding-MPR selection is for a router to select a
   subset of its neighbors such that a packet, retransmitted by these
   selected neighbors, will be received by all routers 2 hops away.
   This property is called the Flooding-MPR "coverage criterion".  The
   Flooding-MPR set of a router is computed such that, for each OSPFv3
   MANET interface, it satisfies this criterion.  The information
   required to perform this calculation (i.e., link sensing and
   neighborhood information) is acquired through periodic exchange of
   OSPFv3 Hello packets.

   Flooding-MPRs are computed by each router that operates at least one
   OSPFv3 MANET interface.  The smaller the Flooding-MPR set is, the
   lower the overhead will be.  However, while it is not essential that
   the Flooding-MPR set is minimal, the "coverage criterion" MUST be
   satisfied by the selected Flooding-MPR set.

   The willingness of a neighbor router to act as Flooding-MPR MAY be
   taken into consideration by a heuristic for Flooding-MPR selection.
   An example heuristic that takes willingness into account is given in
   <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

   A router MUST signal its Flooding-MPRs set to its neighbors by
   including an FMPR TLV in generated Hello packets.  Inclusion of this
   FMPR TLV signals the list of symmetric 1-hop neighbors that the
   sending router has selected as Flooding-MPRs, as well as the
   willingness of the sending router to be elected Flooding-MPR by other
   routers.  The FMPR TLV structure is detailed in <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a>.

   1.  symmetric 1-hop neighbors that are selected as Flooding-MPRs;

   advertised.

   The costs of the links between the router and each of its MANET
   neighbors on the OSPFv3 MANET interface over which the Hello packet
   is sent MUST be signaled by including METRIC-MPR TLVs.  The METRIC-
   MPR TLV structure is detailed in <a href="#section-6.2">Section 6.2</a>.

   Moreover, the lowest cost from each MANET neighbor towards the router
   (regardless of over which interface) MUST be specified in the

   In addition to the processing specified in [<a href="rfc5340.html" title='"OSPF for IPv6"'>RFC5340</a>], N and N2 MUST

   received Hello packet signals that a tuple in N (or N2) is to be
   deleted, the deletion is done immediately, without waiting for the
   tuple to expire.  Note that N2 records not only 2-hop neighbors
   listed in received Hellos but also 2-hop neighbors listed in the
   appended PMPR TLVs.

   The Flooding-MPR set MUST be recomputed when either of N(i) or N2(i)

   Over an OSPFv3 MANET interface, a router MUST bring up adjacencies
   with all MANET neighbors that are included in its MPR set and its
   MPR-selector set; this ensures that, beyond the first hop, routes use
   synchronized links (if synchronized paths are preferred over non-
   synchronized paths of equal cost).  A router MAY bring up adjacencies
   with other MANET neighbors, at the expense of additional
   synchronization overhead.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.1.%20%20Packets%20over%202-Way%20Links"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.1" name="section-5.3.1">5.3.1</a>.  Packets over 2-Way Links</span>

   When a router does not form a full adjacency with a MANET neighbor,
   the state of that neighbor does not progress beyond 2-Way (as defined
   in [<a href="rfc2328.html" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>RFC2328</a>]).  A router can send protocol packets, such as LSAs, to
   a MANET neighbor in 2-Way state.  Therefore, any packet received from
   a symmetric MANET neighbor MUST be processed.

   As with the OSPF broadcast interface [<a href="rfc2328.html" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>RFC2328</a>], the next hop in the
   forwarding table MAY be a neighbor that is not adjacent.  However,
   when a data packet has travelled beyond its first hop, the MPR-
   selection process guarantees that subsequent hops in the shortest
   path tree (SPT) will be over adjacencies (if synchronized paths are
   preferred over non-synchronized paths of equal cost).

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.2.%20%20Adjacency%20Conservation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3.2" name="section-5.3.2">5.3.2</a>.  Adjacency Conservation</span>

   Adjacencies are torn down according to [<a href="rfc2328.html" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>RFC2328</a>].  When the MPR set
   or MPR-selector set is updated (due to changes in the neighborhood),
   and when a neighbor was formerly, but is no longer, in the MPR set or
   the MPR-selector set, then the adjacency with that neighbor is kept
   unless the change causes the neighbor to cease being a symmetric
   1-hop neighbor.

   When a router receives Hello packets from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor
   that ceases to list this router as being adjacent (see
   <a href="#section-5.2.6">Section 5.2.6</a>), the state of that neighbor MUST be changed to:

   1.  2-Way if the neighbor is not in the MPR set or MPR-selector set,
       or

   2.  ExStart if either the neighbor is in the MPR set or MPR-selector
       set, or the neighbor or the router itself is a Synch router.

   When a router receives an LSA over an OSPFv3 MANET interface, the
   router MUST proceed to acknowledge the LSA as follows:

   1.  If the LSA was not received from an adjacent neighbor, the router
       MUST NOT acknowledge it.

   2.  Otherwise, if the LSA was received from an adjacent neighbor and
       if the LSA is already in the Link State Database (i.e., the LSA
       has already been received and processed), then the router MUST
       send an acknowledgment for this LSA on all OSPFv3 MANET
       interfaces to the multicast address all_SPF_Routers.

   3.  Otherwise, if the LSA is not already in the Link State Database:

       1.  If the router decides to retransmit the LSA (as part of the
           flooding procedure), the router MUST NOT acknowledge it, as
           this retransmission will be considered as an implicit
           acknowledgment.

       2.  Otherwise, if the router decides to not retransmit the LSA
           (as part of the flooding procedure), the router MUST send an
           explicit acknowledgment for this LSA on all OSPFv3 MANET
           interfaces to the multicast address all_SPF_Routers.

   If a router sends an LSA on an OSPFv3 MANET interface, it expects
   acknowledgments (explicit or implicit) from all adjacent neighbors.
   In the case where the router did not generate, but simply relays, the
   LSA, then the router MUST expect acknowledgments (explicit or
   implicit) only from adjacent neighbors that have not previously
   acknowledged this LSA.  If a router detects that some adjacent
   neighbor has not acknowledged the LSA, then that router MUST
   retransmit the LSA.

   If, due to the MPR flooding-reduction mechanism employed for LSA
   flooding as described in <a href="#section-5.4.1">Section 5.4.1</a>, a router decides to not relay
   an LSA, the router MUST still expect acknowledgments of this LSA
   (explicit or implicit) from adjacent neighbors that have not
   previously acknowledged this LSA.  If a router detects that some
   adjacent neighbor has not acknowledged the LSA, then the router MUST
   retransmit the LSA.

   Note that it may be beneficial to aggregate several acknowledgments
   in the same transmission, taking advantage of native multicasting (if

   Additionally, jitter [<a href="rfc5148.html" title='"Jitter Considerations in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs)"'>RFC5148</a>] on packet (re)transmission MAY be used

   In addition to the operations described in <a href="#section-5.2">Section 5.2</a>, <a href="#section-5.3">Section 5.3</a>
   and <a href="#section-5.4">Section 5.4</a>, Hybrid routers MUST:

   o  select ALL their MANET neighbors as Path-MPRs.

   o  list adjacencies over OSPFv3 interfaces of types other than OSPFv3
      MANET interface, as specified in [<a href="rfc5340.html" title='"OSPF for IPv6"'>RFC5340</a>] and [<a href="rfc2328.html" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>RFC2328</a>], in

   In a network with no Hybrid routers, at least one Synch router MUST
   be selected.  A Synch router MUST:

   o  set the S bit in the PMPR TLV appended to the Hello packets it
      generates, AND

   o  become adjacent with ALL MANET neighbors.

   A proposed heuristic for selection of Sync routers is as follows:

   o  A router that has a MANET interface and an ID that is higher than
      the ID of all of its current neighbors, and whose ID is higher
      than any other ID present in Router-LSAs currently in its Link
      State Database selects itself as Synch router.

   Other heuristics are possible; however, any heuristic for selecting
   Synch routers MUST ensure the presence of at least one Synch or
   Hybrid router in the network.

   When routing table (re)computation occurs, in addition to the
   processing of the Link State Database defined in [<a href="rfc5340.html" title='"OSPF for IPv6"'>RFC5340</a>] and
   [<a href="rfc2328.html" title='"OSPF Version 2"'>RFC2328</a>], routers that have one or more MANET interfaces MUST take
   into account links between themselves and MANET neighbors that are in
   state 2-Way or higher (as data and protocol packets may be sent,
   received, and processed over these links too).  Thus, the
   connectivity matrix used to compute routes MUST reflect links between
   the root and all its neighbors in state 2-Way and higher, as well as
   links described in the Link State Database.

      of 0xFFFF (i.e., infinity) MUST be advertised unless information
      received via Hello packets from the neighbor specifies otherwise,
      in which case the received information MUST be advertised.  If a
      neighbor is reachable via more than one interface, the cost
      advertised MUST be the minimum of the costs by which that neighbor
      can be reached.

      included in order that the PMPR TLV is 32-bit aligned.  Padding
      MUST be included when the TLV contains an odd number of Cost
      fields and MUST NOT be included otherwise.

   [<a id="ref-RFC4593" name="ref-RFC4593">RFC4593</a>] describes generic threats to routing protocols, whose
   applicability to OSPFv3 [<a href="rfc5340.html" title='"OSPF for IPv6"'>RFC5340</a>] is not altered by the presence of
   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces.  As such, the OSPFv3 MANET interface type
   does not introduce new security threats to [<a href="rfc5340.html" title='"OSPF for IPv6"'>RFC5340</a>].




<span class="grey">Baccelli, et al.              Experimental                     [Page 24]</span></pre>

   However, the use of a wireless medium and the lack of infrastructure,
   as enabled by the use of the OSPFv3 MANET interface type, may render
   some of the attacks described in [<a href="rfc4593.html" title='"Generic Threats to Routing Protocols"'>RFC4593</a>] easier to undertake.

   For example, control-traffic sniffing and control-traffic analysis
   are simpler tasks with wireless than with wires, as it is sufficient
   to be somewhere within radio range in order to "listen" to wireless
   traffic.  Inconspicuous wiretapping of the right cable(s) is not
   necessary.

   In a similar fashion, physical signal interference is also a simpler
   task with wireless than with wires, as it is sufficient to emit from
   somewhere within radio range in order to be able to disrupt the
   communication medium.  No complex wire connection is required.

   Other types of interference (including not forwarding packets),
   spoofing, and different types of falsification or overloading (as
   described in [<a href="rfc4593.html" title='"Generic Threats to Routing Protocols"'>RFC4593</a>]) are also threats to which routers using
   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces may be subject.  In these cases, the lack of
   predetermined infrastructure or authority, enabled by the use of
   OSPFv3 MANET interfaces, may facilitate such attacks by making it
   easier to forge legitimacy.

   Moreover, the consequence zone of a given threat, and its consequence
   period (as defined in [<a href="rfc4593.html" title='"Generic Threats to Routing Protocols"'>RFC4593</a>]), may also be slightly altered over
   the wireless medium, compared to the same threat over wired networks.
   Indeed, mobility and the fact that radio range spans "further" than a
   mere cable may expand the consequence zone in some cases; meanwhile,
   the more dynamic nature of MANET topologies may decrease the
   consequence period, as harmful information (or lack of information)
   will tend to be replaced quicker by legitimate information.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Flooding-MPR%20Selection%20Heuristic"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" name="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Flooding-MPR Selection Heuristic</span>

   The following specifies a proposed heuristic for selection of
   Flooding-MPRs on interface i.  It constructs a Flooding-MPR set that
   enables a router to reach routers in the 2-hop neighborhood through
   relaying by one Flooding-MPR router.

   The following terminology will be used in describing the heuristics:
   D(Y) is the degree of a 1-hop neighbor, router Y (where Y is a member
   of N(i), defined as the number of neighbors of router Y, EXCLUDING
   all the members of N(i) and EXCLUDING the router performing the
   computation.  The proposed heuristic can then be described as
   follows.  Begin with an empty Flooding-MPR set.  Then:

   1.  Calculate D(Y), where Y is a member of N(i), for all routers in
       N(i).

   2.  Add to the Flooding-MPR set those routers in N(i) that are the
       only routers to provide reachability to a router in N2(i).  For
       example, if router B in N2(i) can be reached only through a
       router A in N(i), then add router A to the Flooding-MPR set.
       Remove the routers from N2(i) that are now covered by a router in
       the Flooding-MPR set.

   3.  While there exist routers in N2(i) that are not covered by at
       least one router in the Flooding-MPR set:

       1.  For each router in N(i), calculate the reachability, i.e.,
           the number of routers in N2(i) that are not yet covered by at
           least one router in the Flooding-MPR set, and that are
           reachable through this 1-hop neighbor;

       2.  Select as a Flooding-MPR the neighbor with the highest
           willingness among the routers in N(i) with non-zero
           reachability.  In case of a tie among routers with the same
           willingness, select the router that provides reachability to
           the maximum number of routers in N2(i).  In case of another
           tie between routers also providing the same amount of
           reachability, select as Flooding-MPR the router whose D(Y) is
           greater.  Remove the routers from N2(i) that are now covered
           by a router in the Flooding-MPR set.

   4.  As an optimization, consider in increasing order of willingness
       each router Y in the Flooding-MPR set: if all routers in N2(i)
       are still covered by at least one router in the Flooding-MPR set
       when excluding router Y, then router Y MAY be removed from the
       Flooding-MPR set.

   Other algorithms, as well as improvements over this algorithm, are
   possible.  Different routers may use different algorithms
   independently.  However, the algorithm used MUST provide the router
   with a Flooding-MPR set that fulfills the flooding coverage
   criterion, i.e., it MUST select a Flooding-MPR set such that any
   2-hop neighbor is covered by at least one Flooding-MPR router.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Appendix%20B.%20%20Path-MPR%20Selection%20Heuristic"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-B" name="appendix-B">Appendix B</a>.  Path-MPR Selection Heuristic</span>

   The following specifies a proposed heuristic for calculating a Path-
   MPR set that enables a router to reach routers in the 2-hop
   neighborhood through shortest paths via routers in its Path-MPR set.
   The following terminology will be used for describing this heuristic:

   A -  The router performing the Path-MPR set calculation.

   B, C, D, .... -  Other routers in the network.

   cost(A,B) -  The cost of the path through the direct link, from A to
      B.

   dist(C,A) -  The cost of the shortest path from C to A.

   A cost matrix is populated with the values of the costs of links
   originating from router A (available locally) and with values listed
   in Hello packets received from neighbor routers.  More precisely, the
   cost matrix is populated as follows:

   1.  The coefficients of the cost matrix are set by default to 0xFFFF
       (maximal value, i.e., infinity).

   2.  The coefficient cost(A,B) of the cost matrix for a link from
       router A to a neighbor B (the direct cost for this link) is set
       to the minimum cost over all interfaces that feature router B as
       a symmetric 1-hop neighbor.  The reverse cost for this link,
       cost(B,A), is set at the value received in Hello packets from
       router B.  If router B is reachable through several interfaces at
       the same time, cost(B,A) is set as the minimum cost advertised by
       router B for its links towards router A.

   3.  The coefficients of the cost matrix concerning the link between
       two neighbors of A, routers C and B, are populated at the
       reception of their Hello packets.  The cost(B,C) is set to the
       value advertised by the Hello packets from B, and, respectively,
       the cost(C,B) is set to the value advertised in Hello packets
       from C.

   4.  The coefficients cost(B,C) of the cost matrix for a link that
       connects a neighbor B to a 2-hop neighbor C are obtained via the
       Hello packets received from router B.  In this case, cost(B,C)
       and cost(C,B) are respectively set to the values advertised by
       router B for the direct cost and reverse cost for node C.

   Once the cost matrix is populated, the proposed heuristic can then be
   described as follows.  Begin with an empty Path-MPR set.  Then:

   1.  Using the cost matrix and the Dijkstra algorithm, compute the
       router distance vector, i.e., the shortest distance for each pair
       (X,A) where X is in N or N2 minimizing the sum of the cost of the
       path between X and A.

   2.  Compute N' as the subset of N made of the elements X such that
       cost(X,A)=dist(X,A).

   3.  Compute N2' as the subset of N and N2 made of the elements Y that
       do not belong to N' and such that there exist X in N' such
       cost(Y,X)+cost(X,A)=dist(Y,A).

   4.  Compute the MPR selection algorithm presented in <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a> with
       N' instead of N(i) and N2' instead of N2(i).  The resulting MPR
       set is the Path-MPR set.

   Other algorithms, as well as improvements over this algorithm, are
   possible.  Different routers may use different algorithms
   independently.  However, the algorithm used MUST provide the router
   with a Path-MPR set that fulfills the path coverage criterion, i.e.,
   it MUST select a Path-MPR set such that for any element of N or N2
   that is not in the Path-MPR set, there exists a shortest path that
   goes from this element to the router through a neighbor selected as
   Path-MPR (unless the shortest path is only one hop).
