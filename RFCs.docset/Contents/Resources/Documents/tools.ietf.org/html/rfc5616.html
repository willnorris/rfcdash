<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Email clients on resource- and/or network-constrained devices, such
   as mobile phones, may have difficulties in retrieving and/or storing
   large attachments received in a message.  For example, on a poor
   network link, the latency required to download the entire attachment
   before displaying any of it may not be acceptable to the user.
   Conversely, even on a high-speed network, the device may not have
   enough storage space to secure the attachment once retrieved.

   For certain media, such as audio and video, there is a solution: the
   media can be streamed to the device, using protocols such as RTP
   [<a href="#ref-RTP" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RTP</a>].  Streaming can be initiated and controlled using protocols
   such as SIP [<a href="#ref-SIP" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>SIP</a>] and particularly the media server profiles as
   specified in <a href="rfc4240.html">RFC 4240</a> [<a href="#ref-NETANN" title='"Basic Network Media Services with SIP"'>NETANN</a>] or MSCML [<a href="#ref-MSCML" title='"Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) and Protocol"'>MSCML</a>].  Streaming the media
   to the device addresses both the latency issue, since the client can
   start playing the media relatively quickly, and the storage issue,
   since the client does not need to store the media locally.  A
   tradeoff is that the media cannot be viewed/played when the device is
   offline.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5616.html">RFC 5616</a>        Streaming Internet Messaging Attachments     August 2009</span>


   Examples of the types of media that would benefit from the ability to
   stream to the device include:

   o  Voice or video mail messages received as an attachment

   o  Audio clips such as ring tones received as an attachment

   o  Video clips, such as movie trailers, received as an attachment

   The client may wish to present the user with the ability to use
   simple "VCR-style" controls such as pause, fast-forward, and rewind.
   In consideration of this, the document presents two alternatives for
   streaming media -- a simple mechanism that makes use of the
   announcement service of <a href="rfc4240.html">RFC 4240</a>, and a more complex mechanism which
   allows VCR controls, based on MSCML (<a href="rfc5022.html">RFC 5022</a>) [<a href="#ref-MSCML" title='"Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) and Protocol"'>MSCML</a>].  The choice
   of which mechanism to use is up to the client; for example, it may be
   based on limitations of the client or the configured media server.
   This document presents suggestions for determining which of these
   streaming services are available.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>KEYWORDS</a>].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server, respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then some of the line breaks between those lines are
   for editorial clarity only and may not be part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

   The proposed mechanism for streaming media to messaging clients is a
   profile for making use of several existing mechanisms, namely:

   o  IMAP URLAUTH Extension [<a href="#ref-URLAUTH" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - URLAUTH Extension"'>URLAUTH</a>] - Providing the ability to
      generate an IMAP URL that allows access by external entities to
      specific message parts, e.g., an audio clip.

                       Figure 1: Proposed Mechanism

   The proposed mechanism has the following steps:

   (1)  The client determines from MIME headers of a particular message
        that a particular message part (attachment) should be streamed
        to the user.  Note that no assumptions are made about
        how/when/if the client contacts the user of the client about
        this decision.  User input may be required in order to initiate
        the proposed mechanism.

   (2)  The client constructs an IMAP URL referencing the message part,
        and uses the GENURLAUTH [<a href="#ref-URLAUTH" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - URLAUTH Extension"'>URLAUTH</a>] command to generate a URLAUTH-
        authorized IMAP URL.

   (3)  The client connects to a SIP Media Server using the announcement
        service as specified in <a href="rfc4240.html">RFC 4240</a> [<a href="#ref-NETANN" title='"Basic Network Media Services with SIP"'>NETANN</a>], or the IVR service as
        specified in <a href="rfc5022.html">RFC 5022</a> [<a href="#ref-MSCML" title='"Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) and Protocol"'>MSCML</a>], and passes the URLAUTH-authorized
        URL to the media server.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5616.html">RFC 5616</a>        Streaming Internet Messaging Attachments     August 2009</span>


   (4)  The media server connects to the IMAP server specified in the
        referenced URL, and uses the IMAP URLFETCH [<a href="#ref-URLAUTH" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - URLAUTH Extension"'>URLAUTH</a>] command to
        retrieve the message part.

   (5)  The media server streams the retrieved message part to the
        client using RTP [<a href="#ref-RTP" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RTP</a>].

   (6)  The media server or the client terminates the media streaming,
        or the streaming ends naturally.  The SIP session is terminated
        by either client or server.

   It should be noted that the proposed mechanism makes several
   assumptions about the mobile device, as well as available network
   services, namely:

   o  The mobile device is provisioned with, or obtains via some dynamic
      mechanism (see <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>), the location of a media server which
      supports either <a href="rfc4240.html">RFC 4240</a> [<a href="#ref-NETANN" title='"Basic Network Media Services with SIP"'>NETANN</a>] and/or <a href="rfc5022.html">RFC 5022</a> [<a href="#ref-MSCML" title='"Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) and Protocol"'>MSCML</a>].

   o  The media server(s) used by the mobile device support the IMAP URL
      [<a href="#ref-IMAPURL" title='"IMAP URL Scheme"'>IMAPURL</a>] scheme for the announcement and/or IVR services.

   o  The IMAP server used by the mobile device supports generating
      anonymous IMAP URLs using the URLAUTH mechanism as well as the
      IMAP URLFETCH BINARY [<a href="#ref-URLFETCH_BINARY">URLFETCH_BINARY</a>] extension.

   This section discusses possibilities for the automatic discovery of
   suitable media servers to perform streaming operations, and provides
   for such a mechanism using the IMAP METADATA [<a href="#ref-METADATA" title='"The IMAP METADATA Extension"'>METADATA</a>] extension.

   There are two possibilities for clients with regard to determining
   the hostname and port number information of a suitable media server:

   1.  No discovery of media servers is required: clients are configured
       with suitable media server information in an out-of-band manner.

   2.  Discovery of media servers is required: clients use a discovery
       mechanism to determine a suitable media server that will be used
       for streaming multimedia message parts.

   There are several scenarios where media server discovery would be a
   requirement for streaming to be successful:

   o  Client is not configured with the address of any media servers.





<span class="grey">Cook                         Informational                      [Page 5]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5616.html">RFC 5616</a>        Streaming Internet Messaging Attachments     August 2009</span>


   o  Client is configured with the address of one or more media
      servers, but the IMAP server is configured to only accept URLFETCH
      requests from specific media servers (for security or site policy
      reasons), and thus streaming would fail due to the media server
      not being able to retrieve the media from the IMAP server.

   There is also a scenario where media server discovery would improve
   the security of the streaming mechanism, by avoiding the use of
   completely anonymous URLs.  For example, the client could discover a
   media server address that was an authorized user of the IMAP server
   for streaming purposes, which would allow the client to generate a
   URL, which was secure in that it could *only* be accessed by an
   entity that is trusted by the IMAP server to retrieve content.  The
   issue of trust in media servers is discussed more fully in <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>.

   This document describes using the IMAP METADATA [<a href="#ref-METADATA" title='"The IMAP METADATA Extension"'>METADATA</a>] extension,
   via the use of a server entry that provides the contact information
   for suitable media servers for use with the IMAP server.  Media
   Server discovery is optional: clients are free to use pre-configured
   information about media servers, or to fall back to pre-configured
   information if they encounter IMAP servers that do not support either
   the METADATA extension or the proposed entry, or that do not provide
   a value for the entry.

   A METADATA entry with the name of "/shared/mediaServers" is used to
   store the locations of suitable media servers known to the IMAP
   server.  The entry is formatted according to the formalSyntax
   specified in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>.  This consists of a tuple of a URI and
   optional "stream" string, where the URI is surrounded by &lt;&gt; symbols,
   the URI and "stream" are separated using a colon ":", and tuples are
   separated using a ";".

   The "stream" string (c.f. the "stream" access identifier from
   [<a href="#ref-ACCESSID" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - URL Access Identifier Extension"'>ACCESSID</a>]) is used to identify media servers capable of connecting
   to the IMAP server as users authorized to retrieve URLs constructed
   using the "stream" access identifier.  It indicates that the client
   MUST create the content URI using the "stream" access identifier.
   See <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a> for a description of how the client should make use
   of the access identifier when generating IMAP URLs.)

   Example values of the /shared/mediaServers METADATA entry (N.B. Any
   line-wrapping below is for the purpose of clarity):

   "&lt;sip:ivr@ms.example.net:5060&gt;:stream;&lt;sip:annc@
   ms1.example.net:5060&gt;;&lt;sips:ivr@ms2.example.net:5061&gt;"

   "&lt;sip:ivr@192.0.2.40:5060&gt;;&lt;sip:192.0.2.41:5060&gt;;&lt;sips:annc@
   192.0.2.42:5060&gt;:stream"

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5616.html">RFC 5616</a>        Streaming Internet Messaging Attachments     August 2009</span>


   It should be noted that the URI specified in the ABNF (in <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a>)
   is generic, i.e., not restricted to SIP URIs; however, this document
   only specifies how to make use of SIP URIs.  Additionally, the
   "userinfo" (known as the "service indicator" in <a href="rfc4240.html">RFC 4240</a> and <a href="rfc4722.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc4722.html">4722</a>) component of the URI is optional; if specified, it gives the
   client additional information about the media server capabilities.
   For example, a "userinfo" component of "annc" indicates that the
   media server supports <a href="rfc4240.html">RFC 4240</a>, and "ivr" indicates support for <a href="rfc4722.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc4722.html">4722</a>.  <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a> further describes how clients should behave if the
   "userinfo" component is not present.

   Clients SHOULD parse the value of the /shared/mediaServers entry, and
   contact a media server using one of the returned URIs.  The servers
   are returned in order of preference as suggested by the server;
   however, it is left to the client to decide if a different order is
   more appropriate when selecting the media server(s) to contact, as
   well as the selection of alternates under failure conditions.

   Administrators configuring the values of the /shared/mediaServers
   entry, who do not know the capabilities of the media servers being
   configured, SHOULD NOT include a "userinfo" component as part of the
   URI.  In that case, the client will determine which service to use as
   specified in <a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>.  Note that if a media server supports
   multiple services, a URI with the appropriate userinfo component
   SHOULD be configured for each service.

   Note that even though the media server address can be discovered
   dynamically, it is assumed that the necessary security arrangements
   between the client and the media server already exist.  For example,
   the media server could use SIP digest authentication to provide
   access only to authenticated clients; in this case, it is assumed the
   username and password have already been set up.  Likewise, if the
   client wants to authenticate the media server using, e.g., TLS and
   certificates, it is assumed the necessary arrangements (trust anchors
   and so on) already exist.  In some deployments, the clients and media
   servers may even be willing to rely on the security of the underlying
   network, and omit authentication between the client and the media
   server entirely.  See <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> for more details.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.3.%20%20Client%20Use%20of%20GENURLAUTH%20Command"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.3" name="section-3.3">3.3</a>.  Client Use of GENURLAUTH Command</span>

   The decision to make use of streaming services for a message part
   will usually be predicated on the content type of the message part.
   Using the capabilities of the IMAP FETCH command, clients determine
   the MIME [<a href="#ref-MIME" title='"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)"'>MIME</a>] Content-Type of particular message parts, and based
   on local policies or heuristics, they decide whether streaming for
   that message part will be attempted.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5616.html">RFC 5616</a>        Streaming Internet Messaging Attachments     August 2009</span>


   Once the client has determined that a particular message part
   requires streaming, the client generates an IMAP URL that refers to
   the message part according to the method described in <a href="rfc5092.html">RFC 5092</a>
   [<a href="#ref-IMAPURL" title='"IMAP URL Scheme"'>IMAPURL</a>].  The client then begins the process of generating an
   URLAUTH URL by appending ";EXPIRE=&lt;datetime&gt;" and ";URLAUTH=&lt;access&gt;"
   to the initial URL.

   The ";EXPIRE=&lt;datetime&gt;" parameter is optional; however, it SHOULD be
   used, since the use of anonymous URLAUTH-authorized URLs is a
   security risk (see <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>), and it ensures that at some point in
   the future, permission to access that URL will cease.  IMAP server
   implementors may choose to reject anonymous URLs that are considered
   insecure (for example, with an EXPIRE date too far in the future), as
   a matter of local security policy.  To prevent this from causing
   interoperability problems, IMAP servers that implement this profile
   MUST NOT reject GENURLAUTH commands for anonymous URLs on the basis
   of the EXPIRE time, if that time is equal to, or less than, 1 hour in
   the future.

   The &lt;access&gt; portion of the URLAUTH URL MUST be 'stream' (see
   [<a href="#ref-ACCESSID" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - URL Access Identifier Extension"'>ACCESSID</a>]) if an out-of-band mechanism or the media server discovery
   mechanism discussed in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a> specifies that the media server is
   an authorized user of the IMAP server for the purposes of retrieving
   content via URLFETCH.  Without specific prior knowledge of such a
   configuration (either through the discovery mechanism described in
   this document, or by an out-of-band mechanism), the client SHOULD use
   the 'stream' access identifier, which will cause streaming to fail if
   the media server is not an authorized user of the IMAP server for the
   purposes of streaming.

   However, if the client wishes to take the risk associated with
   generating a URL that can be used by any media server (see
   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a>), it MAY use 'anonymous' as the &lt;access&gt; portion of the
   URLAUTH URL passed to the GENURLAUTH command.  For example, the
   client may have been pre-configured with the address of media servers
   in the local administrative domain (thus implying a level of trust in
   those media servers), without knowing whether those media servers
   have a pre-existing trust relationship with the IMAP server to be
   used (which may well be in a different administrative domain).  See
   <a href="#section-4">Section 4</a> for a full discussion of the security issues.

   The client uses the URL generated as a parameter to the GENURLAUTH
   command, using the INTERNAL authorization mechanism.  The URL
   returned by a successful response to this command will then be passed
   to the media server.  If no successful response to the GENURLAUTH
   command is received, then no further action will be possible with
   respect to streaming media to the client.

   Once an authorized IMAP URL has been generated, it is up to the
   client to pass that URL to a suitable media server that is capable of
   retrieving the URL via IMAP, and streaming the content to the client
   using the RTP [<a href="#ref-RTP" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RTP</a>] protocol.

   This section specifies the behavior of clients that have not
   determined (either statically through configuration, or dynamically
   through a discovery process as discussed in <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>), the
   capabilities of the media server with respect to the services (i.e.,
   <a href="rfc4240.html">RFC 4240</a> or 5022) supported by that media server.  Clients that have
   determined those capabilities should use the mechanisms described in
   Sections <a href="#section-3.5">3.5</a> or <a href="#section-3.7">3.7</a>, as appropriate.

   If the client supports the MSCML IVR service, then it SHOULD attempt
   to contact the media server using the MSCML protocol by sending a SIP
   INVITE that has the service indicator "ivr".

   Assuming the media server responds to the INVITE without error, the
   client can carry on using the MSCML IVR service as specified in
   <a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>.  If the media server responds with an error indicating
   that the "ivr" service is not supported, then if the client supports
   it, the client SHOULD attempt to contact the media server using the
   announcement service, as described in <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>.

   The following example shows an example SIP INVITE using the "ivr"
   service indicator:

   C: INVITE sip:ivr@ms2.example.com SIP/2.0
   &lt; SIP Header fields omitted for reasons of brevity &gt;

   Assuming the client or media server does not support use of the MSCML
   protocol, the media server announcement service is used, as described
   in <a href="rfc4240.html">RFC 4240</a> [<a href="#ref-NETANN" title='"Basic Network Media Services with SIP"'>NETANN</a>].  This service allows the client to send a SIP
   INVITE to a special username ('annc') at the media server (the
   "announcement" user), supplying the URL obtained as per <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.

   The SIP INVITE is constructed as shown in the examples below; note
   that as per <a href="rfc4240.html">RFC 4240</a>, the play parameter is mandatory and specifies
   the authorized IMAP URL to be played.

   Examples of valid SIP INVITE URIs sent to the media server
   announcement service:

   C: sip:annc@ms2.example.net;
   play=imap:%2F%2Fjoe@example.com%2FINBOX%2F%3Buid%3D24356%2F%3Bsection

   Notice that many of the characters that are used as parameters of the
   IMAP URI are escaped, as otherwise they would change the meaning of
   the enclosing SIP URI, by being regarded as SIP URI parameters
   instead of IMAP URL parameters.

   If the client receives a 200 (OK) response, the media server has
   successfully retrieved the content from the IMAP server and the
   negotiated RTP stream will shortly begin.

   There are many possible response codes; however, a response code of
   404 received from the media server indicates that the content could
   not be found or could not be retrieved for some reason.  For example,
   the media server may not support the use of IMAP URLs.  At this
   point, there are several options to the client, such as using
   alternate media servers, or giving up in attempting to stream the
   required message part.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.6.%20%20Media%20Negotiation%20and%20Transcoding"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.6" name="section-3.6">3.6</a>.  Media Negotiation and Transcoding</span>

   This document uses standards and protocols from two traditionally
   separate application areas: Mobile Email (primarily IMAP) and
   Internet Telephony/Streaming (e.g., SIP/RTP).  Since the document
   primarily addresses enhancing the capabilities of mobile email, it is
   felt worthwhile to give some examples of simple SIP/SDP exchanges and
   to discuss capabilities such as media negotiation (using SDP) and
   media transcoding.

   In the below example, the client contacts the media server using the
   SIP INVITE command to contact the announcement service (see
   <a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>), advertising support for a range of audio and video
   codecs (using SDP [<a href="#ref-SDP" title='"SDP: Session Description Protocol"'>SDP</a>]), and in response the media server advertises
   only a set of audio codecs.  This process is identical for the IVR
   service, except that the IVR service does not use the SIP Request-URI
   to indicate the content to be played; instead, this is carried in a
   subsequent SIP INFO request.

   The client and server now know from the SDP session description
   advertised by both client and server that communication must be using
   the subset of audio codecs supported by both client and server (in
   the example SDP session description below, it is clear that the
   server does not support any video codecs).  The media server may
   perform transcoding (i.e., converting between codecs) on the media
   received from the IMAP server in order to satisfy the codecs
   supported by the client.  For example, the media server may downgrade
   the video retrieved from the IMAP server to the audio component only.

   For clients using the announcement service, the media server MUST
   return an error to the INVITE if it cannot find a common codec
   between the client, server and media, or it cannot transcode to a
   suitable codec.  Similarly, for clients using the MSCML IVR service,
   the media server MUST return a suitable error response to the
   &lt;playcollect&gt; request.

   Once the client has determined that the media server supports the IVR
   service, it is up to the client to generate a suitable MSCML request
   to initiate streaming of the required media.

   When using the IVR service, the initial SIP invite is used only to
   establish that the media server supports the MSCML IVR service, and
   to negotiate suitable media codecs.  Once the initial SIP INVITE and
   response to that INVITE have been completed successfully, the client
   must generate a SIP INFO request with MSCML in the body of the
   request to initiate streaming.

   The &lt;playcollect&gt; request is used, as this allows the use of dual
   tone multi-frequency (DTMF) digits to control playback of the media,
   such as fast-forward or rewind.

   Since the &lt;playcollect&gt; request is used purely for its VCR-like
   capabilities, there is no need for the media server to perform DTMF
   collection.  Therefore, the playcollect attributes "firstdigittimer",
   "interdigittimer", and "extradigittimer" SHOULD all be set to "0ms",
   which will have the effect of causing digit collection to cease
   immediately after the media has finished playing.

   The "ffkey" and "rwkey" attributes of &lt;playcollect&gt; are used to
   control fast-forward and rewind behavior, with the "skipinterval"
   attribute being used to control the 'speed' of these actions.

   The &lt;prompt&gt; tag is used to specify the media to be played, and
   SHOULD have a single &lt;audio&gt; tag that gives the URL of the media, as
   per the <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>.  The audio-specific name of the tag is
   historical, as the tag can be used for video as well as audio

   content.  The "stoponerror" attribute SHOULD be set to "yes", so that
   meaningful error messages will be returned by the media server in the
   event of problems such as retrieving the media from the IMAP server.

   An example SIP INFO request using the &lt;playcollect&gt; request is shown
   at the end of this section.

   It should be noted that under normal (i.e., non-error) conditions,
   the response to the &lt;playcollect&gt; request is a SIP 200 (OK) response.
   The media server then streams the media, and only when the media has
   finished playing (naturally or due to a user request) does the media
   server send a &lt;playcollect&gt; response, which includes details of the
   media played, such as length and any digits collected.

   The client may suspend playback of the media at any time by either
   sending the DTMF escape key (specified as an attribute to the
   &lt;playcollect&gt; request) or by sending a &lt;stop&gt; request to the media
   server in a SIP INFO request.  Upon receipt of the request, the media
   server will acknowledge it, and then cease streaming of the media,
   followed by a SIP INFO request containing the &lt;playcollect&gt; response.

   If the media server cannot play the media for any reason (for
   example, if it cannot retrieve the media from the IMAP server),
   streaming will not take place, and the &lt;playcollect&gt; response will be
   sent, usually with meaningful values in the &lt;error_info&gt; element.

   The following gives an example dialog between a client and media
   server, including a rewind request, and termination of the playback
   by use of the escape key.  Some elements of the SIP dialog such as
   full SIP header fields and SDP are omitted for reasons of brevity.
   (The protocol diagram in <a href="#section-3.9.2">Section 3.9.2</a> shows the high-level message
   flow between all the components, including the IMAP server.)

   This section describes how the media server converts the IMAP URL
   received via the announcement or IVR service into suitable IMAP
   commands for retrieving the content.

   The media server first connects to the IMAP server specified in the
   URL.  Once connected, the media server SHOULD use TLS [<a href="#ref-TLS" title='"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2"'>TLS</a>] to
   encrypt the communication path.

   If the media server has a user identity on the IMAP server, the media
   server SHOULD authenticate itself to the IMAP server using the media
   server's user identity.

   If the media server is not configured as an authorized user of the
   IMAP server, then the behavior specified in IMAP URL [<a href="#ref-IMAPURL" title='"IMAP URL Scheme"'>IMAPURL</a>] MUST
   be followed.  That is, if the server advertises AUTH=ANONYMOUS IMAP
   capability, the media server MUST use the AUTHENTICATE command with
   the ANONYMOUS [<a href="#ref-ANONYMOUS" title='"Anonymous Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism"'>ANONYMOUS</a>] SASL mechanism.  If SASL ANONYMOUS is not
   available, the username "anonymous" is used with the "LOGIN" command
   and the password is supplied as the Internet email address of the
   administrative contact for the media server.

   Once authenticated, the media server issues the URLFETCH command,
   using the URL supplied in the 'play' parameter of the SIP INVITE (or
   audio tag of the MSCML).  If the IMAP server does not advertise
   URLAUTH=BINARY in its post-authentication capability string, then the
   media server returns a suitable error code to the client.

   The additional parameters to the URLFETCH command specified in
   (URLFETCH BINARY) [<a href="#ref-URLFETCH_BINARY">URLFETCH_BINARY</a>] are used by the media server to
   tell the IMAP server to remove any transfer encoding and return the
   content type of the media (as content-type information is not
   contained in the IMAP URL).

   A successful URLFETCH command will return the message part containing
   the media to be streamed.  If the URLFETCH was unsuccessful, then the
   media server MUST return an appropriate error response to the client.

   Assuming the content is retrieved successfully, the media server
   returns a 200 (OK) response code to the client.  After an ACK is
   received, an RTP stream is delivered to the client using the
   parameters negotiated in the SDP.

   If appropriate, the media server MAY choose to implement connection
   caching, in which case, connection and disconnection from the IMAP
   server are handled according to whatever algorithm the media server
   chooses.  For example, the media server may know, a priori, that it

   This section gives examples of using the mechanism described in the
   document to stream media from a media server to a client, fetching
   the content from an IMAP server.  In all of the examples, the IMAP,

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document proposes the use of URLAUTH [<a href="#ref-URLAUTH" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - URLAUTH Extension"'>URLAUTH</a>] "pawn tickets",
   received over IMAP [<a href="#ref-IMAP" title='"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1"'>IMAP</a>], and transmitted over SIP [<a href="#ref-SIP" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>SIP</a>], possibly
   within the MSCML payload of <a href="rfc5022.html">RFC 5022</a> [<a href="#ref-MSCML" title='"Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) and Protocol"'>MSCML</a>], in order to stream
   media received in messages.  As such, the security considerations in
   all these documents apply to this specification.

   In summary, as the authorized URLs may grant access to data,
   implementors of this specification need to consider the following
   with respect to the security implications of using IMAP URLs:

   o  Use of an anonymous pawn ticket grants access to any client of the
      IMAP server without requiring any authentication credentials.  The
      security mechanisms referenced above (with the caveats specified
      below) SHOULD be used to prevent unauthorized access to the pawn
      ticket.

   o  Use of pawn tickets that contain the "stream" access identifier
      restricts access to the content to those entities that are
      authorized users of the IMAP server for the purposes of streaming
      retrieved content.  Use of such pawn tickets is thus desirable and
      so implementors should consult <a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>, which describes when
      such pawn tickets should be used.

   o  If the announcement service is used to set up streaming, then <a href="rfc4240.html">RFC</a>
      <a href="rfc4240.html">4240</a> [<a href="#ref-NETANN" title='"Basic Network Media Services with SIP"'>NETANN</a>] specifies that the pawn ticket is passed in the
      Request-URI, and so untrusted third parties may be able to
      intercept the pawn ticket.  The SIP communication channel MAY be
      secured by using SIPS URIs [<a href="#ref-SIP" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>SIP</a>], which would provide hop-by-hop
      TLS encryption.

   o  If the IVR service (<a href="rfc5022.html">RFC 5022</a> [<a href="#ref-MSCML" title='"Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) and Protocol"'>MSCML</a>]) is used to set up and
      control streaming, then MSCML is used to carry the pawn ticket in
      the body of the request, and so untrusted third parties may be
      able to intercept the pawn ticket.  This MAY be secured by using
      SIPS URIs [<a href="#ref-SIP" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>SIP</a>], which would provide hop-by-hop TLS encryption.

   o  Using SIPS URIs in the above situations protects the pawn ticket
      from third parties; however, it still allows proxies access to the
      pawn ticket, which could result in misuse by malicious proxies;
      see note below.

   This document describes a mechanism that makes use of two separate
   servers to achieve the goal of streaming the content desired by the
   client.  A major security implication of this is that the media
   server and IMAP server may well be located in separate administrative
   domains.  This leads us to consider the security implications of a

   three-way protocol exchange, and the potential trust model implicit
   in that tripartite relationship.  The security implications of the
   individual protocols have already been referenced; therefore, this
   section describes the security considerations specific to the three-
   way data exchange, as follows:

   o  The client grants the media server full access to the potentially
      private media content specified by the IMAP URL.  As a result, the
      client is responsible for verifying the authenticity of the media
      server to a degree it finds acceptable for the content (we can
      refer to this process as determining the "trust" that the client
      has in a particular media server).  The security mechanisms
      provided by SIP [<a href="#ref-SIP" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>SIP</a>] and RTP [<a href="#ref-RTP" title='"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications"'>RTP</a>] may be used for this purpose,
      as well as out of band mechanisms such as pre-configuration.

   o  However, since the media server will retrieve content from an IMAP
      server on the user's behalf, the issue of security between the
      IMAP server and the media server also needs to be considered.  A
      client has no way of determining (programatically at least) the
      security of the exchanges between the media server and the IMAP
      server.  However, it can determine, using the "stream" token that
      is part of the media server discovery mechanism described in
      <a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>, that the media server has a pre-existing
      authentication relationship with the IMAP server for the purposes
      of retrieving content using IMAP URLs.  The IMAP server
      administrator may put prerequisites on media server administrator
      before this relationship can be established, for example, to
      guarantee the security of the communication between the media
      server and the IMAP server.

   o  The above two security considerations will influence the decision
      the client makes with regards to generation of the pawn ticket
      that is subsequently passed to the media server.  This document
      mandates the use of URLs protected with the "stream" access
      identifier where the client knows in advance that the "stream"
      authentication relationship between media server and IMAP server
      exists.  However, it does allow the use of anonymous pawn tickets
      where the possibility exists that use of "stream" would cause
      streaming to fail.

   o  There exists the possibility of several types of attack by a
      malicious media server, SIP proxy, or other network elements even
      against pawn tickets protected with the "stream" access
      identifier.  All of these attacks allow access to the RTP stream,
      if not the original content.  These attacks include:

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc5616.html">RFC 5616</a>        Streaming Internet Messaging Attachments     August 2009</span>


      *  The client contacts a malicious media server, MS1, that then
         proxies the streaming request to a second media server, MS2,
         that it has determined or guessed to have "stream"
         authorization credentials with the IMAP server specified in the
         pawn ticket.  The media server can then redirect the streamed
         RTP traffic elsewhere.

      *  Any proxy on the path between the client and the media server
         has access to the client's message in cleartext.  In this case,
         a malicious proxy could perform a man-in-the-middle attack and
         could change the message to redirect RTP traffic elsewhere.

      *  Any network element that is able to "see" the traffic between
         the client and the media server (or between any two proxies)
         can capture the pawn ticket, and then reissue a request using
         that pawn ticket to the same media server.  Again the streamed
         traffic can be redirected to any desired location.

   Media servers handling streaming requests will be making use of pawn-
   ticket URLs for the period of time required to process the streaming
   request, after which the URL will be forgotten.  However, media
   servers may log the URLs received from clients, in which case, the
   private data contained in the IMAP server could be accessed by a
   malicious or curious media server administrator.  Even URLs protected
   with EXPIRE may be accessed within the period of expiry.  Therefore,
   media servers SHOULD remove or anonymize the internal portion of the
   IMAP URL when logging that URL.

   Additionally, many of the security considerations in the Message
   Submission BURL Extension apply to this document, particularly around
   the use of pawn tickets and prearranged trust relationships such as
   those described above.

   Message parts that are encrypted using mechanisms such as S/MIME
   [<a href="#ref-SMIME" title='"Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.1 Message Specification"'>SMIME</a>] are designed to prevent third parties from accessing the
   data, thus media servers will not be able to fulfill streaming
   requests for messages parts that are encrypted.

   This document does not specify any Digital Rights Management (DRM)
   mechanisms for controlling access to and copying of the media to be
   streamed.  This is intentional.  A reference to a piece of media
   content is created using the URLAUTH [<a href="#ref-URLAUTH" title='"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - URLAUTH Extension"'>URLAUTH</a>] command; thus, any DRM
   required should be implemented within the media itself, as
   implementing checks within URLAUTH could affect any use of the
   URLAUTH command, such as the BURL [<a href="#ref-BURL" title='"Message Submission BURL Extension"'>BURL</a>] command for message
   submission.

   The use of URLAUTH in this specification is believed to be pursuant
   with, and used only for, the execution of those rights to be expected
   when media is sent via traditional internet messaging, and causes no
   duplication of media content that is not essentially provided by the
   action of sending the message.  In other words, the use of the
   content for downloading and viewing *is* implicitly granted by the
   sender of the message, in as much as the sender has the right to
   grant such rights.

   The document author believes that if DRM is a requirement for
   Internet messaging, then a suitable DRM mechanism should be created.
   How such a mechanism would work is outside the scope of this
   document.

   unlikely, but not prohibited, for end-user SIP UACs to have a direct
   signaling relationship with a media server".  This caveat makes it
   likely that firewalls and other network security mechanisms will be
   configured to block direct end-user access to media servers.

   In order for either of the streaming mechanisms described in this
   document to work, local administrators MUST relax firewall policies
   such that appropriate SIP UACs (user agent clients) running on mobile
   devices are permitted to access the media servers directly using the
   SIP protocol.  The detail of how the restrictions are relaxed (for
   example, only allowing clients connecting from the network space
   owned/maintained by the operator of the media server) is a matter of
   local policy, and so is outside the scope of this document.

   The following syntax specification for the mediaServers METADATA
   entry value uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation as
   specified in <a href="rfc5234.html">RFC 5234</a> [<a href="#ref-ABNF" title='"Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF"'>ABNF</a>] and the "absolute-URI" definition from
   <a href="rfc3986.html">RFC 3986</a> [<a href="rfc3986.html" title='"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax"'>RFC3986</a>].

   Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
   insensitive.  The use of upper or lower case characters to define
   token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST
   accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion.
