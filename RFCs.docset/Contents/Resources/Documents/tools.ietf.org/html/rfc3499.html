                                        Extensions for IPv6

The de facto standard Application Program Interface (API) for TCP/IP
applications is the "sockets" interface.  Although this API was
developed for Unix in the early 1980s it has also been implemented on a
wide variety of non-Unix systems.  TCP/IP applications written using the
sockets API have in the past enjoyed a high degree of portability and we
would like the same portability with IPv6 applications.  But changes are
required to the sockets API to support IPv6 and this memo describes
these changes.  These include a new socket address structure to carry
IPv6 addresses, new address conversion functions, and some new socket
options.  These extensions are designed to provide access to the basic
IPv6 features required by TCP and UDP applications, including
multicasting, while introducing a minimum of change into the system and
providing complete compatibility for existing IPv4 applications.
Additional extensions for advanced IPv6 features (raw sockets and access
to the IPv6 extension headers) are defined in another document.  This
memo provides information for the Internet community.

                                        Internationalized Domain Names
                                        in Applications (IDNA)

Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax designed for
use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA).  It
uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into an ASCII
string.  ASCII characters in the Unicode string are represented
literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by ASCII characters
that are allowed in host name labels (letters, digits, and hyphens).
This document defines a general algorithm called Bootstring that allows
a string of basic code points to uniquely represent any string of code
points drawn from a larger set.  Punycode is an instance of Bootstring
that uses particular parameter values specified by this document,
appropriate for IDNA.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

Until now, there has been no standard method for domain names to use
characters outside the ASCII repertoire.  This document defines
internationalized domain names (IDNs) and a mechanism called
Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) for handling them
in a standard fashion.  IDNs use characters drawn from a large
repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII characters to be
represented using only the ASCII characters already allowed in so-called
host names today.  This backward-compatible representation is required
in existing protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced with no
changes to the existing infrastructure.  IDNA is only meant for
processing domain names, not free text.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address
Translators (NATs) (STUN) is a lightweight protocol that allows
applications to discover the presence and types of NATs and firewalls
between them and the public Internet.  It also provides the ability for
applications to determine the public Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
allocated to them by the NAT.  STUN works with many existing NATs, and
does not require any special behavior from them.  As a result, it allows
a wide variety of applications to work through existing NAT

This document describes two algorithms, for source address selection and
for destination address selection.  The algorithms specify default
behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations.
They do not override choices made by applications or upper-layer
protocols, nor do they preclude the development of more advanced
mechanisms for address selection.  The two algorithms share a common
context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to
provide policy that can override the default behavior.  In dual stack
implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can
consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses - depending on the available
source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4
addresses, or vice-versa.

All IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers, must implement default
address selection as defined in this specification.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

This document provides an overview of E.164 telephone number portability
(NP) in the Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN).

NP is a regulatory imperative seeking to liberalize local telephony
service competition, by enabling end-users to retain telephone numbers
while changing service providers.  NP changes the fundamental nature of
a dialed E.164 number from a hierarchical physical routing address to a
virtual address, thereby requiring the transparent translation of the
later to the former.  In addition, there are various regulatory
constraints that establish relevant parameters for NP implementation,
most of which are not network technology specific.  Consequently, the
implementation of NP behavior consistent with applicable regulatory
constraints, as well as the need for interoperation with the existing
GSTN NP implementations, are relevant topics for numerous areas of IP
telephony works-in-progress with the IETF.  This memo provides
information for the Internet community.

Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) systems will be used in core
networks where system downtime must be kept to an absolute minimum.
Many MPLS Label Switching Routers (LSRs) may, therefore, exploit Fault

core networks.

The details of how FT is achieved for the various components of an FT
LSR, including Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), the switching hardware
and TCP, are implementation specific.  This document identifies issues
in the LDP specification in <a href="rfc3036.html">RFC 3036</a>, "LDP Specification", that make it
difficult to implement an FT LSR using the current LDP protocols, and
defines enhancements to the LDP specification to ease such FT LSR
implementations.

                                        Label Distribution Protocol

This document describes a mechanism that helps to minimize the negative
effects on MPLS traffic caused by Label Switching Router's (LSR's)
control plane restart, specifically by the restart of its Label
Distribution Protocol (LDP) component, on LSRs that are capable of
preserving the MPLS forwarding component across the restart.

The mechanism described in this document is applicable to all LSRs, both
those with the ability to preserve forwarding state during LDP restart
and those without (although the latter needs to implement only a subset
of the mechanism described in this document).  Supporting (a subset of)
the mechanism described here by the LSRs that can not preserve their
MPLS forwarding state across the restart would not reduce the negative
impact on MPLS traffic caused by their control plane restart, but it
would minimize the impact if their neighbor(s) are capable of preserving
the forwarding state across the restart of their control plane and
implement the mechanism described here.

The mechanism makes minimalistic assumptions on what has to be preserved
across restart - the mechanism assumes that only the actual MPLS
forwarding state has to be preserved; the mechanism does not require any
of the LDP-related states to be preserved across the restart.

The procedures described in this document apply to downstream
unsolicited label distribution.  Extending these procedures to
downstream on demand label distribution is for further study.

specifications has been defined to provide support for different
technologies as well as different applications.  These include support
for requesting TDM connections based on Synchronous Optical
NETwork/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) as well as Optical
Transport Networks (OTNs).

This document concentrates on the signaling aspects of the GMPLS suite
of protocols, specifically GMPLS signaling using Resource Reservation
Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE).  It proposes additional
extensions to these signaling protocols to support the capabilities of
an ASON network.

This document proposes appropriate extensions towards the resolution of
additional requirements identified and communicated by the ITU-T Study
Group 15 in support of ITU's ASON standardization effort.  This memo
provides information for the Internet community.

Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) integrates the label swapping
forwarding paradigm with network layer routing.  To deliver reliable
service, MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide protection of the
traffic carried on different paths.  This requires that the label
switching routers (LSRs) support fault detection, fault notification,
and fault recovery mechanisms, and that MPLS signaling support the
configuration of recovery.  With these objectives in mind, this document
specifies a framework for MPLS based recovery.  Restart issues are not
included in this framework.  This memo provides information for the
Internet community.

This document proposes a small modification to the way TCP increases its
congestion window.  Rather than the traditional method of increasing the
congestion window by a constant amount for each arriving acknowledgment,
the document suggests basing the increase on the number of previously
unacknowledged bytes each ACK covers.  This change improves the
performance of TCP, as well as closes a security hole TCP receivers can
use to induce the sender into increasing the sending rate too rapidly.

This memo defines a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
content-type that may be used by a message transfer agent (MTA) or
electronic mail gateway to report the result of an attempt to deliver a
message to one or more recipients.  This content-type is intended as a
machine-processable replacement for the various types of delivery status
notifications currently used in Internet electronic mail.

Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging
systems (such as X.400 or the so-called "Local Area Network (LAN)-based"
systems), the Delivery Status Notification (DSN) protocol is designed to
be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment.  To this end, the
protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign"
addresses and error codes, in addition to those normally used in
Internet mail.  Additional attributes may also be defined to support
"tunneling" of foreign notifications through Internet mail.  [STANDARDS

By knowing what parts of a message the sender deems critical, a content
gateway can intelligently handle multi-part messages when providing
gateway services to systems of lesser capability.  Critical content can
help a content gateway to decide what parts to forward.  It can indicate
how hard a gateway should try to  deliver a body part.  It can help the
gateway to pick body parts that are safe to silently delete when a
system of lesser capability receives a message.  In addition, critical
content can help the gateway chose the notification strategy for the
receiving system.  Likewise, if the sender expects the destination to do
some processing on a body part, critical content allows the sender to
mark body parts that the receiver must process.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

This memo explores the requirements for host configuration in IPsec
tunnel mode, and describes how the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCPv4) may be leveraged for configuration.  In many remote access
scenarios, a mechanism for making the remote host appear to be present
on the local corporate network is quite useful.  This may be
accomplished by assigning the host a "virtual" address from the
corporate network, and then tunneling traffic via IPsec from the host's
ISP-assigned address to the corporate security gateway.  In IPv4, DHCP
provides for such remote host configuration.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

This memo describes the use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to
efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for one-to-many reliable
data transport using IP multicast.  One of the key properties of FEC
codes in this context is the ability to use the same packets containing
FEC data to simultaneously repair different packet loss patterns at
multiple receivers.  Different classes of FEC codes and some of their
basic properties are described and terminology relevant to implementing
FEC in a reliable multicast protocol is introduced.  Examples are
provided of possible abstract formats for packets carrying FEC.  This
memo provides information for the Internet community.

This document generally describes how to use Forward Error Correction
(FEC) codes to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for data
transport.  The primary focus of this document is the application of FEC
codes to one-to-many reliable data transport using IP multicast.  This
document describes what information is needed to identify a specific FEC
code, what information needs to be communicated out-of-band to use the
FEC code, and what information is needed in data packets to identify the
encoding symbols they carry.  The procedures for specifying FEC codes
and registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
are also described.  This document should be read in conjunction with
and uses the terminology of the companion document titled, "The Use of
Forward Error Correction (FEC) in Reliable Multicast".  This memo
defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.

Layered Coding Transport (LCT) provides transport level support for
reliable content delivery and stream delivery protocols.  LCT is
specifically designed to support protocols using IP multicast, but also
provides support to protocols that use unicast.  LCT is compatible with
congestion control that provides multiple rate delivery to receivers and
is also compatible with coding techniques that provide reliable delivery
of content.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
community.

                                        of Network Path Asymmetry

This document describes TCP performance problems that arise because of
asymmetric effects.  These problems arise in several access networks,
including bandwidth-asymmetric networks and packet radio subnetworks,
for different underlying reasons.  However, the end result on TCP
performance is the same in both cases: performance often degrades
significantly because of imperfection and variability in the ACK
feedback from the receiver to the sender.

The document details several mitigations to these effects, which have
either been proposed or evaluated in the literature, or are currently
deployed in networks.  These solutions use a combination of local link-
layer techniques, subnetwork, and end-to-end mechanisms, consisting of:
(i) techniques to manage the channel used for the upstream bottleneck
link carrying the ACKs, typically using header compression or reducing
the frequency of TCP ACKs, (ii) techniques to handle this reduced ACK
frequency to retain the TCP sender's acknowledgment-triggered self-
clocking and (iii) techniques to schedule the data and ACK packets in
the reverse direction to improve performance in the presence of two-way
traffic.  Each technique is described, together with known issues, and
recommendations for use.  A summary of the recommendations is provided
at the end of the document.  This document specifies an Internet Best
Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion

This document specifies TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC).  TFRC is a
congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best-
effort Internet environment.  It is reasonably fair when competing for
bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much lower variation of throughput
over time compared with TCP, making it more suitable for applications
such as telephony or streaming media where a relatively smooth sending

                                        Control Protocol Negotiation

This document defines extensions to the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
(L2TP) for enhanced support of link-specific Point to Point Protocol
(PPP) options.  PPP endpoints typically have direct access to the common
physical media connecting them and thus have detailed knowledge about
the media that is in use.  When the L2TP is used, the two PPP peers are
no longer directly connected over the same physical media.  Instead,
L2TP inserts a virtual connection over some or all of the PPP connection
by tunneling PPP frames over a packet switched network such as IP.
Under some conditions, an L2TP endpoint may need to negotiate PPP Link
Control Protocol (LCP) options at a location which may not have access
to all of the media information necessary for proper participation in
the LCP negotiation.  This document provides a mechanism for
communicating desired LCP options between L2TP endpoints in advance of
PPP LCP negotiation at the far end of an L2TP tunnel, as well as a
mechanism for communicating the negotiated LCP options back to where the
native PPP link resides.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

                                        (MGCP) Version 1.0


This document describes an application programming interface and a
corresponding protocol (MGCP) which is used between elements of a
decomposed multimedia gateway.  The decomposed multimedia gateway
consists of a Call Agent, which contains the call control
"intelligence", and a media gateway which contains the media functions,
e.g., conversion from TDM voice to Voice over IP.

Media gateways contain endpoints on which the Call Agent can create,
modify and delete connections in order to establish and control media
sessions with other multimedia endpoints.  Also, the Call Agent can
instruct the endpoints to detect certain events and generate signals.
The endpoints automatically communicate changes in service state to the
Call Agent.  Furthermore, the Call Agent can audit endpoints as well as
the connections on endpoints.

The basic and general MGCP protocol is defined in this document, however
most media gateways will need to implement one or more MGCP packages,
which define extensions to the protocol suitable for use with specific
types of media gateways.  Such packages are defined in separate
documents.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.

This memo describes a periodic sampling method and relevant metrics for
assessing the performance of IP networks.  First, the memo motivates
periodic sampling and addresses the question of its value as an
alternative to the Poisson sampling described in <a href="rfc2330.html">RFC 2330</a>.  The benefits
include applicability to active and passive measurements, simulation of
constant bit rate (CBR) traffic (typical of multimedia communication, or
nearly CBR, as found with voice activity detection), and several
instances in which analysis can be simplified.  The sampling method
avoids predictability by mandating random start times and finite length
tests.  Following descriptions of the sampling method and sample metric
parameters, measurement methods and errors are discussed.  Finally, we
give additional information on periodic measurements, including security
considerations.  [STANDARDS TRACK]

requests carry the content in the form of MIME body parts.  MESSAGE

each Instant Message stands alone, much like pager messages.  MESSAGE

As a result of the nature of Network Address Translation (NAT)
Middleboxes, communicating endpoints that are separated by one or more
NATs do not know how to refer to themselves using addresses that are
valid in the addressing realms of their (current and future) peers.
Various proposals have been made for "UNilateral Self-Address Fixing
(UNSAF)" processes.  These are processes whereby some originating
endpoint attempts to determine or fix the address (and port) by which it
is known to another endpoint - e.g., to be able to use address data in
the protocol exchange, or to advertise a public address from which it
will receive connections.

This document outlines the reasons for which these proposals can be
considered at best as short term fixes to specific problems and the
specific issues to be carefully evaluated before creating an UNSAF
proposal.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the third
version of the Internet-Standard Management Framework, termed the SNMP
version 3 Framework (SNMPv3).  This Framework is derived from and builds
upon both the original Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv1)
and the second Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv2).

The architecture is designed to be modular to allow the evolution of the
Framework over time.

The document explains why using SNMPv3 instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is
strongly recommended.  The document also recommends that RFCs 1157,
1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic status.

RObust Header Compression (ROHC) profile, also known as the zero-byte
profile, beyond the two defined in <a href="rfc3242.html">RFC 3242</a>.  Zero-byte header
compression exists in order to prevent the single-octet ROHC header from
pushing a packet voice stream into the next higher fixed packet size for
the radio.  It is usable in certain widely deployed older air
interfaces.  This document adds the zero-byte operation for ROHC
Bidirectional Reliable mode (R-mode) to the ones specified for
Unidirectional (U-mode) and Bidirectional Optimistic (O-mode) modes of
