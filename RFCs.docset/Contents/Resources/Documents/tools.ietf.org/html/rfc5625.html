<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   Research has found ([<a href="#ref-SAC035" title='"Test Report: DNSSEC Impact on Broadband Routers and Firewalls"'>SAC035</a>], [<a href="#ref-DOTSE" title='"DNSSEC Tests of Consumer Broadband Routers"'>DOTSE</a>]) that many commonly used
   broadband gateways (and similar devices) contain DNS proxies that are
   incompatible in various ways with current DNS standards.

   These proxies are usually simple DNS forwarders, but typically do not
   have any caching capabilities.  The proxy serves as a convenient
   default DNS resolver for clients on the LAN, but relies on an
   upstream resolver (e.g., at an ISP) to perform recursive DNS lookups.

   Note that to ensure full DNS protocol interoperability it is
   preferred that client stub resolvers should communicate directly with
   full-feature, upstream recursive resolvers wherever possible.

   That notwithstanding, this document describes the incompatibilities
   that have been discovered and offers guidelines to implementors on
   how to provide better interoperability in those cases where the
   client must use the broadband gateway's DNS proxy.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Terminology"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Terminology</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [<a href="rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20The%20Transparency%20Principle"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  The Transparency Principle</span>

   It is not considered practical for a simple DNS proxy to implement
   all current and future DNS features.

   There are several reasons why this is the case:

   o  Broadband gateways usually have limited hardware resources.

   o  Firmware upgrade cycles are long, and many users do not routinely
      apply upgrades when they become available.

   o  No one knows what those future DNS features will be or how they
      might be implemented.

   o  Doing so would substantially complicate the configuration user
      interface (UI) of the device.

   Furthermore, some modern DNS protocol extensions (see, e.g., EDNS0
   below) are intended to be used as "hop-by-hop" mechanisms.  If the
   DNS proxy is considered to be such a "hop" in the resolution chain,
   then for it to function correctly, it would need to be fully
   compliant with all such mechanisms.

   [<a id="ref-SAC035" name="ref-SAC035">SAC035</a>] shows that the more actively a proxy participates in the DNS
   protocol, the more likely it is that it will somehow interfere with
   the flow of messages between the DNS client and the upstream
   recursive resolvers.

   The role of the proxy should therefore be no more and no less than to
   receive DNS requests from clients on the LAN side, forward those
   verbatim to one of the known upstream recursive resolvers on the WAN
   side, and ensure that the whole response is returned verbatim to the
   original client.

   It is RECOMMENDED that proxies should be as transparent as possible,
   such that any "hop-by-hop" mechanisms or newly introduced protocol
   extensions operate as if the proxy were not there.

   Except when required to enforce an active security or network policy
   (such as maintaining a pre-authentication "walled garden"), end-users
   SHOULD be able to send their DNS queries to specified upstream

   resolvers, thereby bypassing the proxy altogether.  In this case, the
   gateway SHOULD NOT modify the DNS request or response packets in any
   way.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.%20%20Protocol%20Conformance"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4" name="section-4">4</a>.  Protocol Conformance</span>

   The Transparency Principle above, when combined with Postel's
   Robustness Principle [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0793" title='"Transmission Control Protocol"'>RFC0793</a>], suggests that DNS proxies should not
   arbitrarily reject or otherwise drop requests or responses based on
   perceived non-compliance with standards.

   For example, some proxies have been observed to drop any packet
   containing either the "Authentic Data" (AD) or "Checking Disabled"
   (CD) bits from DNSSEC [<a href="rfc4035.html" title='"Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4035</a>].  This may be because [<a href="rfc1035.html" title='"Domain names - implementation and specification"'>RFC1035</a>]
   originally specified that these unused "Z" flag bits "MUST" be zero.
   However, these flag bits were always intended to be reserved for
   future use, so refusing to proxy any packet containing these flags
   (now that uses for those flags have indeed been defined) is not
   appropriate.

   Therefore, proxies MUST ignore any unknown DNS flags and proxy those
   packets as usual.

   Compression of labels as per <a href="rfc1035.html#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4 of [RFC1035]</a> is optional.

   Proxies MUST forward packets regardless of the presence or absence of

   "TrunCation" (TC) bit in the DNS response header to indicate that
   truncation has occurred.  There are however two standard mechanisms
   (described in Sections <a href="#section-4.4.1">4.4.1</a> and <a href="#section-4.4.2">4.4.2</a>) for transporting responses
   larger than 512 octets.

   Many proxies have been observed to truncate all responses at 512
   octets, and others at a packet size related to the WAN MTU, in either
   case doing so without correctly setting the TC bit.

   Other proxies have been observed to remove the TC bit in server
   responses that correctly had the TC bit set by the server.

   If a DNS response is truncated but the TC bit is not set, then client
   failures may result.  In particular, a naive DNS client library might
   suffer crashes due to reading beyond the end of the data actually
   received.

   Since UDP packets larger than 512 octets are now expected in normal
   operation, proxies SHOULD NOT truncate UDP packets that exceed that
   size.  See <a href="#section-4.4.3">Section 4.4.3</a> for recommendations for packet sizes
   exceeding the WAN MTU.

   If a proxy must unilaterally truncate a response, then the proxy MUST
   set the TC bit.  Similarly, proxies MUST NOT remove the TC bit from
   responses.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.1.%20%20TCP%20Transport"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.1" name="section-4.4.1">4.4.1</a>.  TCP Transport</span>

   Should a UDP query fail because of truncation, the standard fail-over
   mechanism is to retry the query using TCP, as described in <a href="rfc1123.html#section-6.1.3.2">Section</a>
   <a href="rfc1123.html#section-6.1.3.2">6.1.3.2 of [RFC1123]</a>.

   Whilst TCP transport is not strictly mandatory, it is supported by
   the vast majority of stub resolvers and recursive servers.  Lack of
   support in the proxy prevents this fail-over mechanism from working.

   DNS proxies MUST therefore be prepared to receive and forward queries
   over TCP.

   Note that it is unlikely that a client would send a request over TCP
   unless it had already received a truncated UDP response.  Some
   "smart" proxies have been observed to first forward any request
   received over TCP to an upstream resolver over UDP, only for the
   response to be truncated, causing the proxy to retry over TCP.  Such
   behaviour increases network traffic and causes delay in DNS
   resolution since the initial UDP request is doomed to fail.

   Therefore, whenever a proxy receives a request over TCP, the proxy
   SHOULD forward the query over TCP and SHOULD NOT attempt the same
   query over UDP first.

   The "Extension Mechanism for DNS" [<a href="rfc2671.html" title='"Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0)"'>RFC2671</a>] was introduced to allow
   the transport of larger DNS packets over UDP and also to allow for
   additional request and response flags.

   A client may send an OPT Resource Record (OPT RR) in the Additional
   Section of a request to indicate that it supports a specific receive
   buffer size.  The OPT RR also includes the "DNSSEC OK" (DO) flag used
   by DNSSEC to indicate that DNSSEC-related RRs should be returned to
   the client.

   However, some proxies have been observed to either reject (with a
   FORMERR response code) or black-hole any packet containing an OPT RR.
   As per <a href="#section-4.1">Section 4.1</a>, proxies MUST NOT refuse to proxy such packets.

<span class="h4"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/4.4.3.%20%20IP%20Fragmentation"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-4.4.3" name="section-4.4.3">4.4.3</a>.  IP Fragmentation</span>

   Support for UDP packet sizes exceeding the WAN MTU depends on the
   gateway's algorithm for handling fragmented IP packets.  Several
   methods are possible:

   1.  Fragments are dropped.

   2.  Fragments are forwarded individually as they're received.

   3.  Complete packets are reassembled on the gateway and then re-
       fragmented (if necessary) as they're forwarded to the client.

   Method 1 above will cause compatibility problems with EDNS0 unless
   the DNS client is configured to advertise an EDNS0 buffer size
   limited to the WAN MTU less the size of the IP header.  Note that <a href="rfc2671.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="rfc2671.html">2671</a> does recommend that the path MTU should be taken into account
   when using EDNS0.

   Also, whilst the EDNS0 specification allows for a buffer size of up
   to 65535 octets, most common DNS server implementations do not
   support a buffer size above 4096 octets.

   Therefore (irrespective of which of the above methods is in use),
   proxies SHOULD be capable of forwarding UDP packets up to a payload
   size of at least 4096 octets.

   NB: in theory, IP fragmentation may also occur if the LAN MTU is
   smaller than the WAN MTU, although the author has not observed such a
   configuration in use on any residential broadband service.

   [<a id="ref-RFC2845" name="ref-RFC2845">RFC2845</a>] defines TSIG, which is a mechanism for authenticating DNS
   requests and responses at the packet level.

   Any modifications made to the DNS portions of a TSIG-signed query or
   response packet (with the exception of the Query ID) will cause a
   TSIG authentication failure.

   DNS proxies MUST implement <a href="rfc2845.html#section-4.7">Section 4.7 of [RFC2845]</a> and either
   forward packets unchanged (as recommended above) or fully implement
   TSIG.

   As per <a href="#section-4.3">Section 4.3</a>, DNS proxies MUST be capable of proxying packets
   containing TKEY [<a href="rfc2930.html" title='"Secret Key Establishment for DNS (TKEY RR)"'>RFC2930</a>] Resource Records.

   NB: any DNS proxy (such as those commonly found in WiFi hotspot
   "walled gardens") that transparently intercepts all DNS queries and
   that returns unsigned responses to signed queries, will also cause
   TSIG authentication failures.

   Whilst this document is primarily about DNS proxies, most consumers
   rely on DHCP [<a href="rfc2131.html" title='"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol"'>RFC2131</a>] to obtain network configuration settings.
   Such settings include the client machine's IP address, subnet mask,
   and default gateway, but also include DNS-related settings.

   It is therefore appropriate to examine how DHCP affects client DNS
   configuration.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.1.%20%20Domain%20Name%20Server%20%28DHCP%20Option%206%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.1" name="section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Domain Name Server (DHCP Option 6)</span>

   Most gateways default to supplying their own IP address in the DHCP
   "Domain Name Server" option [<a href="rfc2132.html" title='"DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions"'>RFC2132</a>].  The net result is that
   without explicit re-configuration many DNS clients will, by default,
   send queries to the gateway's DNS proxy.  This is understandable
   behaviour given that the correct upstream settings are not usually
   known at boot time.








<span class="grey">Bellis                   Best Current Practice                  [Page 7]</span></pre>

   Most gateways learn their own DNS settings via values supplied by an
   ISP via DHCP or PPP over the WAN interface.  However, whilst many
   gateways do allow the device administrator to override those values,
   some gateways only use those supplied values to affect the proxy's
   own forwarding function, and do not offer these values via DHCP.

   When using such a device, the only way to avoid using the DNS proxy
   is to hard-code the required values in the client operating system.
   This may be acceptable for a desktop system but it is inappropriate
   for mobile devices that are regularly used on many different
   networks.

   As per <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a>, end-users SHOULD be able to send their DNS queries
   directly to specified upstream resolvers, ideally without hard-coding
   those settings in their stub resolver.

   It is therefore RECOMMENDED that gateways SHOULD support device-
   administrator configuration of values for the "Domain Name Server"
   DHCP option.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.2.%20%20Domain%20Name%20%28DHCP%20Option%2015%29"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.2" name="section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Domain Name (DHCP Option 15)</span>

   A significant amount of traffic to the DNS Root Name Servers is for
   invalid top-level domain names, and some of that traffic can be
   attributed to particular equipment vendors whose firmware defaults
   this DHCP option to specific values.

   Since no standard exists for a "local" scoped domain name suffix, it
   is RECOMMENDED that the default value for this option SHOULD be
   empty, and that this option MUST NOT be sent to clients when no value
   is configured.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/5.3.%20%20DHCP%20Leases"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-5.3" name="section-5.3">5.3</a>.  DHCP Leases</span>

   It is noted that some DHCP servers in broadband gateways offer, by
   default, their own IP address for the "Domain Name Server" option (as
   described above) but then automatically start offering the upstream
   servers' addresses once they've been learnt over the WAN interface.

   In general, this behaviour is highly desirable, but the effect for
   the end-user is that the settings used depend on whether the DHCP
   lease was obtained before or after the WAN link was established.

   If the DHCP lease is obtained whilst the WAN link is down, then the
   DHCP client (and hence the DNS client) will not receive the correct
   values until the DHCP lease is renewed.





<span class="grey">Bellis                   Best Current Practice                  [Page 8]</span></pre>

   Whilst no specific recommendations are given here, vendors may wish
   to give consideration to the length of DHCP leases and to whether
   some mechanism for forcing a DHCP lease renewal might be appropriate.

   Another possibility is that the learnt upstream values might be
   persisted in non-volatile memory such that on reboot the same values
   can be automatically offered via DHCP.  However, this does run the
   risk that incorrect values are initially offered if the device is
   moved or connected to another ISP.

   Alternatively, the DHCP server might only issue very short (i.e., 60
   second) leases while the WAN link is down, only reverting to more
   typical lease lengths once the WAN link is up and the upstream DNS
   servers are known.  Indeed, with such a configuration it may be
   possible to avoid the need to implement a DNS proxy function in the
   broadband gateway at all.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6" name="section-6">6</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document introduces no new protocols.  However, there are some
   security-related recommendations for vendors that are listed here.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/6.1.%20%20Forgery%20Resilience"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-6.1" name="section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Forgery Resilience</span>

   Whilst DNS proxies are not usually full-feature resolvers, they
   nevertheless share some characteristics with them.

   Notwithstanding the recommendations above about transparency, many
   DNS proxies are observed to pick a new Query ID for outbound requests
   to ensure that responses are directed to the correct client.

   NB: changing the Query ID is acceptable and compatible with proxying
   TSIG-signed packets since the TSIG signature calculation is based on
   the original message ID, which is carried in the TSIG RR.

   It has been standard guidance for many years that each DNS query
   should use a randomly generated Query ID.  However, many proxies have
   been observed picking sequential Query IDs for successive requests.

   It is strongly RECOMMENDED that DNS proxies follow the relevant
   recommendations in [<a href="rfc5452.html" title='"Measures for Making DNS More Resilient against Forged Answers"'>RFC5452</a>], particularly those in <a href="#section-9.2">Section 9.2</a>
   relating to randomisation of Query IDs and source ports.  This also
   applies to source port selection within any NAT function.

   If a DNS proxy is running on a broadband gateway with NAT that is
   compliant with [<a href="rfc4787.html" title='"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP"'>RFC4787</a>], then it SHOULD also follow the
   recommendations in <a href="rfc5452.html#section-10">Section 10 of [RFC5452]</a> concerning how long DNS
   state is kept.

   Some gateways have been observed to have their DNS proxy listening on
   both internal (LAN) and external (WAN) interfaces.  In this
   configuration, it is possible for the proxy to be used to mount
   reflector attacks as described in [<a href="rfc5358.html" title='"Preventing Use of Recursive Nameservers in Reflector Attacks"'>RFC5358</a>].

   The DNS proxy in a gateway SHOULD NOT, by default, be accessible from
   the WAN interfaces of the device.

   The Transparency and Robustness Principles are not entirely
   compatible with the deep packet-inspection features of security
   appliances such as firewalls, which are intended to protect systems
   on the inside of a network from rogue traffic.

   However, a clear distinction may be made between traffic that is
   intrinsically malformed and that which merely contains unexpected
   data.

   Examples of malformed packets that MAY be dropped include:

   o  invalid compression pointers (i.e., those that point outside of
      the current packet or that might cause a parsing loop)

   o  incorrect counts for the Question, Answer, Authority, and
      Additional Sections (although care should be taken where
      truncation is a possibility)

   Dropped packets will cause the client to repeatedly retransmit the
   original request, with the client only detecting the error after
   several retransmit intervals.

   In these circumstances, proxies SHOULD synthesise a suitable DNS
   error response to the client (i.e., SERVFAIL) instead of dropping the
   packet completely.  This will allow the client to detect the error
   immediately.
