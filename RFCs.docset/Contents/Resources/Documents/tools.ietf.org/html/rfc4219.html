Abstract

   This document specifies a set of questions that authors should be
   prepared to answer as part of a solution to multihoming with IPv6.
   The questions do not assume that multihoming is the only problem of
   interest, nor do they demand a more general solution.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   At the time of this writing there are quite a number of proposed
   solutions to the problem of multihoming within IPv6, and related
   problems such as the locator/identifier split.

   This document contains several sets of questions that attempt to
   focus these solutions on operational problems.  This document does
   not suggest methods to solve the problem.  Rather, we simply want to
   ensure that while solving a problem the medicine is not worse than
   the cure.  We focus on practical operational problems that both
   single-homed and multihomed deployments may face.

   It is the hope of the author that perhaps the authors of other
   proposed solutions will use this document to identify gaps in their
   solutions, and cooperate to close those gaps.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.1.%20%20Reading%20this%20Document"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.1" name="section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Reading this Document</span>

   The questions are organized along the following lines:

   o  changes to on the wire behavior;
   o  routing system interactions;
   o  identifier/mapping split;
   o  application concerns and backward compatibility;
   o  name service interactions;
   o  legal concerns; and
   o  security considerations.

   In reality many questions cut across all of these concerns.  For
   instance, the identifier / locator split has substantial application
   implications, and every area has security considerations.

   Unless it is blatantly obvious, each question contains some reasoning
   as to why it is being asked.  It is envisioned that no solution will
   answer every question with completeness, but that there will be
   tradeoffs to be made.  The answers by the various designers of
   solutions will hopefully shed some light on which tradeoffs we as a
   community wish to make.

   It would seem silly for people who have written detailed answers to
   these questions to have to repeat the exercise.  Therefore, a simple
   reference to existing documents will suffice, so long as the answer
   is complete.  If it is not complete, then feel free to reference it
   and add what text is necessary to make the answer complete.

   This document presumes a familiarity with <a href="rfc3582.html">RFC 3582</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Goals for IPv6 Site- Multihoming Architectures"'>2</a>], and does not
   attempt to repeat the requirements work gathered there.

   Please scope the problem you are attempting to solve and what you are
   not attempting to solve.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.2.%20%20At%20what%20layer%20is%20your%20solution%20applied%2C%20and%20how%3F"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2</a>.  At what layer is your solution applied, and how?</span>

   Is it applied in every packet?  If so, what fields are used?

   Each layer has its benefits and tradeoffs.  For instance, transport
   layer solutions would require that EVERY transport be modified, while
   IP layer solutions may entail expansion of the packet or a change to
   the pseudo-header (thus requiring changes to the transport layer).

   If so, how are rendezvous handled?  Can your solution handle both
   locators changing at the same time?  If so, please explain.  Should
   it?  If not, how will your solution interact with MOBILEIP-V6 [<a href="#ref-3" title='"Mobility Support in IPv6"'>3</a>]

   Expanding the size of an IP packet may cause excessive fragmentation
   in some circumstances.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.6.%20%20Will%20your%20solution%20add%20additional%20latency%3F"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.6" name="section-2.6">2.6</a>.  Will your solution add additional latency?</span>

   Latency is an important factor in many applications, including voice.
   Any substantial amount of additional latency, including session
   initiation would be highly undesirable.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.7.%20%20Can%20multihoming%20capabilities%20be%20negotiated%20end-to-end%20during%20a"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.7" name="section-2.7">2.7</a>.  Can multihoming capabilities be negotiated end-to-end during a</span>

   If the proposal introduces additional overhead, can the information
   be somehow piggybacked on messages that are already used?  This would
   be useful in order to keep connection setup constant.  Please also
   indicate any drawbacks that might apply due to this piggybacking.

   If so, what are they?

   When considering this question, there are really two issues.  First,
   will middleboxes impede your solution by rewriting headers in some
   way, as NATs do for IP addresses, and web caches do at higher layers?
   Second, is there a way in which middleboxes are actually part of your
   solution?  In particular, are they required?  This would be the case,
   for example, with Generalized Structure Element (GSE) (8+8).

   There are several possible approaches.  For instance, a multihoming
   service could attempt to require no changes to the API, in which case
   it is possible that IP addresses might become opaque blobs that work
   with the API, but might break operational assumptions that
   applications make about addresses.  Consider the case of a web server
   that wants to log IP addresses.  How will it accomplish this task?

   Another approach is to have some sort of compatibility library for
   legacy applications, but also provide a richer calling interface for
   transparency.

   Yet another approach would be to only provide the new functionality
   to those applications that make use of a new calling interface.

   One useful exercise would be to provide code fragments that
   demonstrate any API changes.

   In particular, consider ongoing administration, renumbering events,
   and mobile work forces.

   How will your solution handle referrals, such as those within FTP or
   various conferencing or other peer to peer systems?

   Referrals exist within various other protocols, such as so-called
   "peer to peer" applications.  Note that referrals might suffer three
   types of failure:

   firewall and NAT - Is there failure just as what FTP active mode
      experiences today with relatively simple firewalls?
   time-based - Is there something ephemeral about the nature of the
      solution that might cause a referral (such as a URL) to fail over
      time, more so than what we have today?
   location-based - If the binding varies based on where the parties are
      in the network, and if one moves, will they no longer be able to
      find each other?

   Provide a detailed walk-through of SIP + Real Time Streaming Protocol
   (SIP+RTSP) when one or several of the peers are multihomed.  How does
   your analysis change when encrypted RTSP is used or when SIP with
   S/MIME end-to-end (e2e) signalling is used?

   Are you introducing a namespace that might involve mnemonics?  Doing
   so might introduce trademark concerns.  If so, how do you plan to
   address such concerns?

   Are there any organizations required to manage a new name space?  If
   so, please describe what they are and how the method will scale.

   How secure should a multi6 solution be?  This is a reasonable
   question for each solution to answer.  The author opines that the
   worst case should be no worse than what we have today.  For example,
   would a multi6 solution open up a host, on either end of a
   communication, to a time-based attack?  Any such risks should be
   clearly stated by the authors.  Considerable time should be spent on
   threat analysis.  Please see [<a href="#ref-4" title='"Threats Relating to IPv6 Multihoming Solutions"'>4</a>] for more details.

   As IP addresses can often be tied to individuals, are there any
   auditing or privacy concerns introduced by your solution?

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/9.%20%20Acknowledgements"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-9" name="section-9">9</a>.  Acknowledgements</span>

   The author wishes to acknowledge everyone in the multi6 group and
   elsewhere that is putting forward proposals.  It is easy to ask
   questions like the ones found in this document.  It is quite a bit
   harder to develop running code to answer them.  Marcelo Bagnulo, Kurt
   Erik Lindqvist, Joe Touch, Patrik Faltstrom, Brian Carpenter, and
   Iljitsch van Beijnum provided input to this document.
