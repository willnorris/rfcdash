 <span class="h1">DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Bindings for OpenPGP</span>

Abstract

   OpenPGP is a message format for email (and file) encryption that
   lacks a standardized lookup mechanism to securely obtain OpenPGP
   public keys.  DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is a
   method for publishing public keys in DNS.  This document specifies a
   DANE method for publishing and locating OpenPGP public keys in DNS
   for a specific email address using a new OPENPGPKEY DNS resource
   record.  Security is provided via Secure DNS, however the OPENPGPKEY
   record is not a replacement for verification of authenticity via the
   "web of trust" or manual verification.  The OPENPGPKEY record can be
   used to encrypt an email that would otherwise have to be sent
   unencrypted.

   OpenPGP [<a href="rfc4880.html" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>RFC4880</a>] public keys are used to encrypt or sign email
   messages and files.  To encrypt an email message, or verify a
   sender's OpenPGP signature, the email client Mail User Agent (MUA) or
   the email server Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) needs to locate the
   recipient's OpenPGP public key.

   OpenPGP clients have relied on centralized "well-known" key servers
   that are accessed using the HTTP Keyserver Protocol [<a href="#ref-HKP" title='"The OpenPGP HTTP Keyserver Protocol (HKP)"'>HKP</a>].
   Alternatively, users need to manually browse a variety of different
   front-end websites.  These key servers do not require a confirmation
   of the email address used in the User ID (UID) of the uploaded
   OpenPGP public key.  Attackers can -- and have -- uploaded rogue
   public keys with other people's email addresses to these key servers.

   Once uploaded, public keys cannot be deleted.  People who did not
   pre-sign a key revocation can never remove their OpenPGP public key
   from these key servers once they have lost access to their private
   key.  This results in receiving encrypted email that cannot be
   decrypted.

   Therefore, these key servers are not well suited to support MUAs and
   MTAs to automatically encrypt email -- especially in the absence of
   an interactive user.

   This document describes a mechanism to associate a user's OpenPGP
   public key with their email address, using the OPENPGPKEY DNS RRtype.
   These records are published in the DNS zone of the user's email
   address.  If the user loses their private key, the OPENPGPKEY DNS
   record can simply be updated or removed from the zone.

   The OPENPGPKEY data is secured using Secure DNS [<a href="rfc4035.html" title='"Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4035</a>].

   The main goal of the OPENPGPKEY resource record is to stop passive
   attacks against plaintext emails.  While it can also thwart some
   active attacks (such as people uploading rogue keys to key servers in
   the hopes that others will encrypt to these rogue keys), this
   resource record is not a replacement for verifying OpenPGP public
   keys via the "web of trust" signatures, or manually via a fingerprint
   verification.

   This specification is one experiment in improving access to public
   keys for end-to-end email security.  There are a range of ways in
   which this can reasonably be done for OpenPGP or S/MIME, for example,
   using the DNS, or SMTP, or HTTP.  Proposals for each of these have

   been made with various levels of support in terms of implementation
   and deployment.  For each such experiment, specifications such as
   this will enable experiments to be carried out that may succeed or
   that may uncover technical or other impediments to large- or small-
   scale deployments.  The IETF encourages those implementing and
   deploying such experiments to publicly document their experiences so
   that future specifications in this space can benefit.

   This document defines an RRtype whose use is Experimental.  The goal
   of the experiment is to see whether encrypted email usage will
   increase if an automated discovery method is available to MTAs and
   MUAs to help the end user with email encryption key management.

   It is unclear if this RRtype will scale to some of the larger email
   service deployments.  Concerns have been raised about the size of the
   OPENPGPKEY record and the size of the resulting DNS zone files.  This
   experiment hopefully will give the working group some insight into
   whether or not this is a problem.

   If the experiment is successful, it is expected that the findings of
   the experiment will result in an updated document for standards track
   approval.

   The OPENPGPKEY RRtype somewhat resembles the generic CERT record
   defined in [<a href="rfc4398.html" title='"Storing Certificates in the Domain Name System (DNS)"'>RFC4398</a>].  However, the CERT record uses sub-typing with
   many different types of keys and certificates.  It is suspected that
   its general application of very different protocols (PKIX versus
   OpenPGP) has been the cause for lack of implementation and
   deployment.  Furthermore, the CERT record uses sub-typing, which is
   now considered to be a bad idea for DNS.

   The OPENPGPKEY DNS resource record (RR) is used to associate an end

   key, can do so by adding multiple OPENPGPKEY records.  A single
   OPENPGPKEY DNS record MUST only contain one OpenPGP key.

   The type value allocated for the OPENPGPKEY RR type is 61.  The
   OPENPGPKEY RR is class independent.

   The RDATA portion of an OPENPGPKEY resource record contains a single
   value consisting of a Transferable Public Key formatted as specified
   in [<a href="rfc4880.html" title='"OpenPGP Message Format"'>RFC4880</a>].

   An OpenPGP Transferable Public Key can be arbitrarily large.  DNS
   records are limited in size.  When creating OPENPGPKEY DNS records,
   the OpenPGP Transferable Public Key should be filtered to only
   contain appropriate and useful data.  At a minimum, an OPENPGPKEY
   Transferable Public Key for the user hugh@example.com should contain:

             o The primary key X
               o One User ID Y, which SHOULD match 'hugh@example.com'
                 o Self-signature from X, binding X to Y

   If the primary key is not encryption-capable, at least one relevant
   subkey should be included, resulting in an OPENPGPKEY Transferable
   Public Key containing:

           o The primary key X
             o One User ID Y, which SHOULD match 'hugh@example.com'
               o Self-signature from X, binding X to Y
             o Encryption-capable subkey Z
               o Self-signature from X, binding Z to X
             o (Other subkeys, if relevant)

   The user can also elect to add a few third-party certifications,
   which they believe would be helpful for validation in the traditional
   "web of trust".  The resulting OPENPGPKEY Transferable Public Key
   would then look like:

           o The primary key X
             o One User ID Y, which SHOULD match 'hugh@example.com'
               o Self-signature from X, binding X to Y
               o Third-party certification from V, binding Y to X
               o (Other third-party certifications, if relevant)
             o Encryption-capable subkey Z

   When preparing a Transferable Public Key for a specific OPENPGPKEY
   RDATA format with the goal of minimizing certificate size, a user
   would typically want to:

   o  Where one User ID from the certifications matches the looked-up
      address, strip away non-matching User IDs and any associated
      certifications (self-signatures or third-party certifications).

   o  Strip away all User Attribute packets and associated
      certifications.

   o  Strip away all expired subkeys.  The user may want to keep revoked
      subkeys if these were revoked prior to their preferred expiration
      time to ensure that correspondents know about these earlier than
      expected revocations.

   o  Strip away all but the most recent self-signature for the
      remaining User IDs and subkeys.

   o  Optionally strip away any uninteresting or unimportant third-party
      User ID certifications.  This is a value judgment by the user that
      is difficult to automate.  At the very least, expired and
      superseded third-party certifications should be stripped out.  The
      user should attempt to keep the most recent and most well-
      connected certifications in the "web of trust" in their
      Transferable Public Key.

   The DNS does not allow the use of all characters that are supported
   in the "local-part" of email addresses as defined in [<a href="rfc5322.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>] and
   [<a href="rfc6530.html" title='"Overview and Framework for Internationalized Email"'>RFC6530</a>].  Therefore, email addresses are mapped into DNS using the
   following method:

   1.  The "left-hand side" of the email address, called the "local-
       part" in both the mail message format definition [<a href="rfc5322.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>] and in
       the specification for internationalized email [<a href="rfc6530.html" title='"Overview and Framework for Internationalized Email"'>RFC6530</a>]) is
       encoded in UTF-8 (or its subset ASCII).  If the local-part is
       written in another charset, it MUST be converted to UTF-8.

   2.  The local-part is first canonicalized using the following rules.
       If the local-part is unquoted, any comments and/or folding
       whitespace (CFWS) around dots (".") is removed.  Any enclosing
       double quotes are removed.  Any literal quoting is removed.

   3.  If the local-part contains any non-ASCII characters, it SHOULD be
       normalized using the Unicode Normalization Form C from
       [<a href="#ref-Unicode90">Unicode90</a>].  Recommended normalization rules can be found in
       <a href="rfc6530.html#section-10.1">Section 10.1 of [RFC6530]</a>.

   4.  The local-part is hashed using the SHA2-256 [<a href="rfc5754.html" title='"Using SHA2 Algorithms with Cryptographic Message Syntax"'>RFC5754</a>] algorithm,
       with the hash truncated to 28 octets and represented in its
       hexadecimal representation, to become the left-most label in the
       prepared domain name.

   5.  The string "_openpgpkey" becomes the second left-most label in
       the prepared domain name.

   6.  The domain name (the "right-hand side" of the email address,
       called the "domain" in [<a href="rfc5322.html" title='"Internet Message Format"'>RFC5322</a>]) is appended to the result of
       step 2 to complete the prepared domain name.

   For example, to request an OPENPGPKEY resource record for a user
   whose email address is "hugh@example.com", an OPENPGPKEY query would
   be placed for the following QNAME: "c93f1e400f26708f98cb19d936620da35
   eec8f72e57f9eec01c1afd6._openpgpkey.example.com".  The corresponding
   RR in the example.com zone might look like (key shortened for
   formatting):

   c9[..]d6._openpgpkey.example.com. IN OPENPGPKEY &lt;base64 public key&gt;

   Mail systems usually handle variant forms of local-parts.  The most
   common variants are upper- and lowercase, often automatically
   corrected when a name is recognized as such.  Other variants include
   systems that ignore "noise" characters such as dots, so that local-
   parts 'johnsmith' and 'John.Smith' would be equivalent.  Many systems
   allow "extensions" such as 'john-ext' or 'mary+ext' where 'john' or
   'mary' is treated as the effective local-part, and 'ext' is passed to
   the recipient for further handling.  This can complicate finding the
   OPENPGPKEY record associated with the dynamically created email
   address.

   [<a id="ref-RFC5321" name="ref-RFC5321">RFC5321</a>] and its predecessors have always made it clear that only
   the recipient MTA is allowed to interpret the local-part of an
   address.  Therefore, sending MUAs and MTAs supporting OPENPGPKEY MUST
   NOT perform any kind of mapping rules based on the email address.  In
   order to improve chances of finding OPENPGP RRs for a particular
   local-part, domains that allow variant forms (such as treating local-
   parts as case-insensitive) might publish OPENPGP RRs for all variants
   of local-parts, might publish variants on first use (for example, a
   webmail provider that also controls DNS for a domain can publish
   variants as used by owner of a particular local-part) or just publish
   OPENPGP RRs for the most common variants.

   <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> above defines how the local-part is used to determine the
   location where one looks for an OPENPGPKEY record.  Given the variety
   of local-parts seen in email, designing a good experiment for this is
   difficult, as: a) some current implementations are known to lowercase
   at least US-ASCII local-parts, b) we know from (many) other
   situations that any strategy based on guessing and making multiple
   DNS queries is not going to achieve consensus for good reasons, and
   c) the underlying issues are just hard -- see <a href="rfc6530.html#section-10.1">Section 10.1 of
   [RFC6530]</a> for discussion of just some of the issues that would need
   to be tackled to fully address this problem.

   However, while this specification is not the place to try to address
   these issues with local-parts, doing so is also not required to
   determine the outcome of this experiment.  If this experiment
   succeeds, then further work on email addresses with non-ASCII local-
   parts will be needed and, based on the findings from this experiment,
   that would be better than doing nothing or starting this experiment
   based on a speculative approach to what is a very complex topic.

   The OPENPGPKEY record allows an application or service to obtain an
   OpenPGP public key and use it for verifying a digital signature or
   encrypting a message to the public key.  The DNS answer MUST pass
   DNSSEC validation; if DNSSEC validation reaches any state other than
   "Secure" (as specified in [<a href="rfc4035.html" title='"Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4035</a>]), the DNSSEC validation MUST be
   treated as a failure.

   If no OpenPGP public keys are known for an email address, an
   OPENPGPKEY DNS lookup MAY be performed to seek the OpenPGP public key
   that corresponds to that email address.  This public key can then be
   used to verify a received signed message or can be used to send out
   an encrypted email message.  An application whose attempt fails to
   retrieve a DNSSEC-verified OPENPGPKEY RR from the DNS should remember
   that failure for some time to avoid sending out a DNS request for
   each email message the application is sending out; such DNS requests
   constitute a privacy leak.

   Locally stored OpenPGP public keys are not automatically refreshed.
   If the owner of that key creates a new OpenPGP public key, that owner
   is unable to securely notify all users and applications that have its

   OPENPGPKEY lookup to confirm that the locally stored OpenPGP public
   key is still the correct key to use.  If the locally stored OpenPGP
   public key is different from the DNSSEC-validated OpenPGP public key
   currently published in DNS, the confirmation MUST be treated as a
   failure unless the locally stored OpenPGP key signed the newly
   published OpenPGP public key found in DNS.  An application that can
   interact with the user MAY ask the user for guidance; otherwise, the
   application will have to apply local policy.  For privacy reasons, an
   application MUST NOT attempt to look up an OpenPGP key from DNSSEC at
   every use of that key.

   CNAMEs (see [<a href="rfc2181.html" title='"Clarifications to the DNS Specification"'>RFC2181</a>]) and DNAMEs (see [<a href="rfc6672.html" title='"DNAME Redirection in the DNS"'>RFC6672</a>]) can be followed to
   obtain an OPENPGPKEY RR, as long as the original recipient's email
   address appears as one of the OpenPGP public key UIDs.  For example,

   size of OpenPGP keys should not be modified to accommodate this
   section.

   OpenPGP supports various attributes that do not contribute to the
   security of a key, such as an embedded image file.  It is recommended
   that these properties not be exported to OpenPGP public keyrings that
   are used to create OPENPGPKEY resource records.  Some OpenPGP
   software (for example, GnuPG) supports a "minimal key export" that is
   well suited to use as OPENPGPKEY RDATA.  See <a href="#appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.

   DNSSEC is not an alternative for the "web of trust" or for manual
   fingerprint verification by users.  DANE for OpenPGP, as specified in
   this document, is a solution aimed to ease obtaining someone's public
   key.  Without manual verification of the OpenPGP key obtained via
   DANE, this retrieved key should only be used for encryption if the
   only other alternative is sending the message in plaintext.  While
   this thwarts all passive attacks that simply capture and log all
   plaintext email content, it is not a security measure against active
   attacks.  A user who publishes an OPENPGPKEY record in DNS still

   expects senders to perform their due diligence by additional (non-
   DNSSEC) verification of their public key via other out-of-band
   methods before sending any confidential or sensitive information.

   In other words, the OPENPGPKEY record MUST NOT be used to send
   sensitive information without additional verification or confirmation
   that the OpenPGP key actually belongs to the target recipient.

   DNSSEC does not protect the queries from Pervasive Monitoring as
   defined in [<a href="rfc7258.html" title='"Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack"'>RFC7258</a>].  Since DNS queries are currently mostly
   unencrypted, a query to look up a target OPENPGPKEY record could
   reveal that a user using the (monitored) recursive DNS server is
   attempting to send encrypted email to a target.  This information is
   normally protected by the MUAs and MTAs by using Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) encryption using STARTTLS.  The DNS itself can
   mitigate some privacy concerns, but the user needs to select a
   trusted DNS server that supports these privacy-enhancing features.
   Recursive DNS servers can support DNS Query Name Minimalisation
   [<a href="rfc7816.html" title='"DNS Query Name Minimisation to Improve Privacy"'>RFC7816</a>], which limits leaking the QNAME to only the recursive DNS
   server and the nameservers of the actual zone being queried for.
   Recursive DNS servers can also support TLS [<a href="rfc7858.html" title='"Specification for DNS over Transport Layer Security (TLS)"'>RFC7858</a>] to ensure that
   the path between the end user and the recursive DNS server is
   encrypted.

   Various components could be responsible for encrypting an email
   message to a target recipient.  It could be done by the sender's MUA
   or a MUA plug-in or the sender's MTA.  Each of these have their own
   characteristics.  A MUA can ask the user to make a decision before
   continuing.  The MUA can either accept or refuse a message.  The MTA
   must deliver the message as-is, or encrypt the message before
   delivering.  Each of these components should attempt to encrypt an
   unencrypted outgoing message whenever possible.

   In theory, two different local-parts could hash to the same value.
   This document assumes that such a hash collision has a negligible
   chance of happening.

   Organizations that are required to be able to read everyone's
   encrypted email should publish the escrow key as the OPENPGPKEY
   record.  Mail servers of such organizations MAY optionally re-encrypt
   the message to the individual's OpenPGP key.

   An MTA could be operating in a stand-alone mode, without access to
   the sender's OpenPGP public keyring, or in a way where it can access
   the user's OpenPGP public keyring.  Regardless, the MTA MUST NOT
   modify the user's OpenPGP keyring.

   An MTA sending an email MUST NOT add the public key obtained from an
   OPENPGPKEY resource record to a permanent public keyring for future
   use beyond the TTL.

   If the obtained public key is revoked, the MTA MUST NOT use the key
   for encryption, even if that would result in sending the message in
   plaintext.

   If a message is already encrypted, the MTA SHOULD NOT re-encrypt the
   message, even if different encryption schemes or different encryption
   keys would be used.

   If the DNS request for an OPENPGPKEY record returned an Indeterminate
   or Bogus answer as specified in [<a href="rfc4035.html" title='"Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions"'>RFC4035</a>], the MTA MUST NOT send the
   message and queue the plaintext message for encrypted delivery at a
   later time.  If the problem persists, the email should be returned
   via the regular bounce methods.

   If multiple non-revoked OPENPGPKEY resource records are found, the
   MTA SHOULD pick the most secure RR based on its local policy.

   If the public key for a recipient obtained from the locally stored
   sender's public keyring differs from the recipient's OPENPGPKEY RR,
   the MUA SHOULD halt processing the message and interact with the user
   to resolve the conflict before continuing to process the message.

   If the public key for a recipient obtained from the locally stored
   sender's public keyring contains contradicting properties for the
   same key obtained from an OPENPGPKEY RR, the MUA SHOULD NOT accept
   the message for delivery.

   If multiple non-revoked OPENPGPKEY resource records are found, the
   MUA SHOULD pick the most secure OpenPGP public key based on its local
   policy.

   The MUA MAY interact with the user to resolve any conflicts between
   locally stored keyrings and OPENPGPKEY RRdata.

   A MUA that is encrypting a message SHOULD clearly indicate to the
   user the difference between encrypting to a locally stored and
   previously user-verified public key and encrypting to a public key
   obtained via an OPENPGPKEY resource record that was not manually
   verified by the user in the past.

   To prevent amplification attacks, an Authoritative DNS server MAY
   wish to prevent returning OPENPGPKEY records over UDP unless the
   source IP address has been confirmed with [<a href="rfc7873.html" title='"Domain Name System (DNS) Cookies"'>RFC7873</a>].  Such servers
   MUST NOT return REFUSED, but answer the query with an empty answer
   section and the truncation flag set ("TC=1").

   The hashing of the local-part in this document is not a security
   feature.  Publishing OPENPGPKEY records will create a list of hashes
   of valid email addresses, which could simplify obtaining a list of
   valid email addresses for a particular domain.  It is desirable to
   not ease the harvesting of email addresses where possible.

   The domain name part of the email address is not used as part of the
   hash so that hashes can be used in multiple zones deployed using
   DNAME [<a href="rfc6672.html" title='"DNAME Redirection in the DNS"'>RFC6672</a>].  This does makes it slightly easier and cheaper to
   brute-force the SHA2-256 hashes into common and short local-parts, as
   single rainbow tables can be re-used across domains.  This can be
   somewhat countered by using NextSECure version 3 (NSEC3).

   DNS zones that are signed with DNSSEC using NSEC for denial of
   existence are susceptible to zone walking, a mechanism that allows
   someone to enumerate all the OPENPGPKEY hashes in a zone.  This can
   be used in combination with previously hashed common or short local-
   parts (in rainbow tables) to deduce valid email addresses.  DNSSEC-
   signed zones using NSEC3 for denial of existence instead of NSEC are
   significantly harder to brute-force after performing a zone walk.

   Users may have a local key store with OpenPGP public keys.  An
   application supporting the use of OPENPGPKEY DNS records MUST NOT
   modify the local key store without explicit confirmation of the user,
   as the application is unaware of the user's personal policy for
   adding, removing, or updating their local key store.  An application
   MAY warn the user if an OPENPGPKEY record does not match the OpenPGP
   public key in the local key store.

   Applications that cannot interact with users, such as daemon
   processes, SHOULD store OpenPGP public keys obtained via OPENPGPKEY
   up to their DNS TTL value.  This avoids repeated DNS lookups that
   third parties could monitor to determine when an email is being sent
   to a particular user.

   Anyone who can obtain a DNSSEC private key of a domain name via
   coercion, theft, or brute-force calculations, can replace any
   OPENPGPKEY record in that zone and all of the delegated child zones.
   Any future messages encrypted with the malicious OpenPGP key could
   then be read.

   Therefore, an OpenPGP key obtained via a DNSSEC-validated OPENPGPKEY
   record can only be trusted as much as the DNS domain can be trusted,
   and is no substitute for in-person OpenPGP key verification or
   additional OpenPGP verification via "web of trust" signatures present
   on the OpenPGP in question.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc7929.html">RFC 7929</a>                  DANE for OpenPGP Keys              August 2016</span>


<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/Appendix%20A.%20%20Generating%20OPENPGPKEY%20Records"></a><a class="selflink" href="#appendix-A" name="appendix-A">Appendix A</a>.  Generating OPENPGPKEY Records</span>

   The commonly available GnuPG software can be used to generate a
   minimum Transferable Public Key for the RRdata portion of an
   OPENPGPKEY record:

   gpg --export --export-options export-minimal,no-export-attributes \
       hugh@example.com | base64

   The --armor or -a option of the gpg command should not be used, as it
   adds additional markers around the armored key.

   When DNS software reading or signing of the zone file does not yet
   support the OPENPGPKEY RRtype, the Generic Record Syntax of [<a href="rfc3597.html" title='"Handling of Unknown DNS Resource Record (RR) Types"'>RFC3597</a>]
   can be used to generate the RDATA.  One needs to calculate the number
   of octets and the actual data in hexadecimal:

   gpg --export --export-options export-minimal,no-export-attributes \
       hugh@example.com | wc -c
   gpg --export --export-options export-minimal,no-export-attributes \
       hugh@example.com | hexdump -e \
          '"\t" /1 "%.2x"' -e '/32 "\n"'

   These values can then be used to generate a generic record (line
   break has been added for formatting):

   &lt;SHA2-256-trunc(hugh)&gt;._openpgpkey.example.com. IN TYPE61 \# \
       &lt;numOctets&gt; &lt;keydata in hex&gt;

   The openpgpkey command in the hash-slinger software can be used to
   generate complete OPENPGPKEY records

   ~&gt; openpgpkey --output rfc hugh@example.com
   c9[..]d6._openpgpkey.example.com. IN OPENPGPKEY mQCNAzIG[...]

   ~&gt; openpgpkey --output generic hugh@example.com

   This is a copy of the original registration template submitted to
   IANA; the text (including the references) has not been updated.

  A. Submission Date: 23-07-2014

  B.1 Submission Type: [x] New RRTYPE [ ] Modification to RRTYPE
  B.2 Kind of RR: [x] Data RR [ ] Meta-RR

  C. Contact Information for submitter (will be publicly posted):
     Name: Paul Wouters         Email Address: pwouters@redhat.com
     International telephone number: +1-647-896-3464
     Other contact handles: paul@nohats.ca

  D. Motivation for the new RRTYPE application.

     Publishing <a href="rfc4880.html">RFC-4880</a> OpenPGP formatted keys in DNS with DNSSEC
     protection to faciliate automatic encryption of emails in
     defense against pervasive monitoring.

  E. Description of the proposed RR type.

  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dane-openpgpkey-00#section-2">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dane-openpgpkey-00#section-2</a>

  F. What existing RRTYPE or RRTYPEs come closest to filling that need
     and why are they unsatisfactory?

     The CERT RRtype is the closest match. It unfortunately depends on
     subtyping, and its use in general is no longer recommended. It
     also has no human usable presentation format. Some usage types of
     CERT require external URI's which complicates the security model.
     This was discussed in the dane working group.

  G. What mnemonic is requested for the new RRTYPE (optional)?

     OPENPGPKEY

  H. Does the requested RRTYPE make use of any existing IANA registry
     or require the creation of a new IANA subregistry in DNS
     Parameters? If so, please indicate which registry is to be used
     or created. If a new subregistry is needed, specify the
     allocation policy for it and its initial contents. Also include
     what the modification procedures will be.

     The RDATA part uses the key format specified in <a href="rfc4880.html">RFC-4880</a>, which
     itself use
     <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/pgp-parameters/pgp-parameters.xhtm">https://www.iana.org/assignments/pgp-parameters/pgp-parameters.xhtm</a>

     This RRcode just uses the formats specified in those registries for
     its RRdata part.

  I. Does the proposal require/expect any changes in DNS
     servers/resolvers that prevent the new type from being processed
     as an unknown RRTYPE (see [<a href="rfc3597.html" title='"Handling of Unknown DNS Resource Record (RR) Types"'>RFC3597</a>])?

     No.

  J. Comments:

     Currently, three software implementations of
     <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dane-openpgpkey">draft-ietf-dane-openpgpkey</a> are using a private number.
