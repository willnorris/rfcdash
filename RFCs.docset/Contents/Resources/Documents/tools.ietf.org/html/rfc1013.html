   The protocol contains many management mechanisms that are not
   intended for normal applications.  Not all mechanisms are needed to
   build a particular user interface.  It is important to keep in mind
   that the protocol is intended to provide mechanism, not policy.

   This document does not attempt to define precise formats or bit
   encodings.

   <a href="#section-1">SECTION 1</a>.  TERMINOLOGY


   Access control list
           X maintains a list of hosts from which client programs may be
           run.  By default, only programs on the local host may use the
           display, plus any hosts specified in an initial list read by
           the server.  This "access control list" can be changed by
           clients on the local host.  Some server implementations may
           also implement other authorization mechanisms.

   Active grab
           A grab is "active" when the pointer or keyboard is actually
           owned by the single grabbing client.

   Ancestors
           If W is an inferior of A, then A is an "ancestor" of W.

   Atom
           An "atom" is a unique id corresponding to a string name.
           Atoms are used to identify properties, types, and selections.

   Backing store
           When a server maintains the contents of a window, the
           off-screen saved pixels are known as a "backing store".

   Bit gravity
           When a window is resized, the contents of the window are
           not necessarily discarded.  It is possible to request the
           server (though no guarantees are made) to relocate the
           previous contents to some region of the window.  This
           attraction of window contents for some location of a window
           is known as "bit gravity".

   Bitmap
           A "bitmap" is a pixmap of depth one.

   Button grabbing
           Buttons on the pointer may be passively "grabbed" by a
           client.  When the button is pressed, the pointer is then
           actively grabbed by the client.

   Byte order
           For image (pixmap/bitmap) data, byte order is defined by
           the server, and clients with different native byte ordering
            must swap bytes as necessary.  For all other parts of the
           protocol, the byte order is defined by the client, and the
           server swaps bytes as necessary.

   Children
           The "children" of a window are its first-level subwindows.

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1013.html">RFC 1013</a>                                                       June 1987</span>


   Client
           An application program connects to the window system server
           by some interprocess communication (IPC) path, such as a TCP
           connection or a shared memory buffer.  This program is the
           window system server.  More precisely, the client is the IPC
           path itself; a program with multiple paths open to the server
           is viewed as multiple clients by the protocol.  Resource
           lifetimes are controlled by connection lifetimes, not by
           program lifetimes.

   Clipping regions
           In a graphics context, a bitmap or list of rectangles can
           be specified to restrict output to a particular region of
           the window.  The image defined by the bitmap or rectangles
           is called a "clipping region".

   Color cell
           An entry in a colormap is known as a "color cell".  An entry
           contains three values specifying red, green and blue
           intensities.  These values are always viewed as 16 bit
           unsigned numbers, with zero being minimum intensity.  The
           values are scaled by the server to match the display
           hardware.  The components of a cell are coincident with
           components of other cells in DirectColor and TrueColor
           colormaps.

   Colormap
           A "colormap" consists of a set of color cells.  A pixel value
           indexes the color map to produce intensities to be displayed.
           Depending on hardware limitations, one or more colormaps may
           be installed at one time, such that windows associated with
           those maps display with true colors.

   Connection
           The IPC path between the server and client program is known
           as a "connection".  A client program typically (but not
           necessarily) has one connection to the server over which
           requests and events are sent.

   Containment
           A window "contains" the pointer if the window is viewable and
           the hotspot of the cursor is within a visible region of the
           window or a visible region of one of its inferiors.  The
           border of the window is included as part of the window for
           containment.  The pointer is "in" a window if the window
           contains the pointer but no inferior contains the pointer.

   Coordinate system
           The coordinate system has X horizontal and Y vertical, with

           discrete, and in terms of pixels.  Each window and pixmap has

           its own coordinate system.  For a window, the origin is at
           the inside upper left, inside the border.

   Cursor
           A "cursor" is the visible shape of the pointer on a screen.
           It consist of a hot spot, a source bitmap, a shape bitmap,
           and a pair of colors.  The cursor defined for a window
           controls the visible appearance when the pinter is in that
           window.

   Depth
           The "depth" of a window or pixmap is number of bits per pixel
           it has. The depth of a gcontext is the depth of the root of
           the gcontext.

   Device
           Keyboards, mice, tablets, track-balls, button boxes, etc. are
           all collectively known as input "devices".  The core protocol
           only deals with two devices, "the keyboard" and "the
           pointer".

   Drawable
           Both windows and pixmaps may be used as sources and
           destinations  in graphics operations.  These are collectively
           known as "drawables". However, an InputOnly window cannot be
           used as a source or destination in a graphics operation.

   Event
           Clients are informed of information asynchronously via
           "events". These events may be either asynchronously generated
           from devices, or generated as side effects of client
           requests.  Events are grouped into types; events are never
           sent to a client by the server unless the client has
           specificially asked to be informed of that type of event,
           but other clients can force events to be sent to other
           clients. Events are typically reported relative to a window.

   Event mask
           Events are requested relative to a window.  The set of event
           types a client requests relative to a window described using
           an "event mask".

   Event sychronization
           There are certain race conditions possible when
           demultiplexing device events to clients (in particular
           deciding where pointer and keyboard events should be sent
           when in the middle of window management operations).  The
           event synchronization mechanism allows synchronous processing
           of device events.

   Event propagation
           Device-related events "propagate" from the source window to
           ancestor windows until some client has expressed interest in
           handling that type of event, or until the event is discarded
           explicitly.

   Event source
           The smallest window containing the pointer is the "source"
           of a device related event.

   Exposure event
           Servers do not guarantee to preserve the contents of windows
           when windows are obscured or reconfigur contents of regions
           of windows have been lost.

   Extension
           Named "extensions" to the core protocol can be defined to
           extend the system.  Extension to output requests, resources,
           and event types are all possible, and expected.

   Font
           A "font" is an array of glyphs (typically characters).  The
           protocol does no translation or interpretation of character
           sets.  The client simply indicates values used to index the
           glyph array.  A font contains additional metric information
           to determine inter-glyph and inter-line spacing.

   Glyph
           A "glyph" is an image, typically of a character, in a font.

   Grab
           Keyboard keys, the keyboard, pointer buttons, the pointer,
           and the server can be "grabbed" for exclusive use by a
           client.  In general, these facilities are not intended to be
           used by normal applications, but are intended for various
           input and window managers to implement various styles of
           user interfaces.

   Graphics context
           Various information for graphics output is stored in "GC"'s,
           such as foreground pixel, background pixel, line width,
           clipping region, etc.

   Hotspot
           A cursor has an associated "hot spot" which defines a point
           in the cursor that corresponds to the coordinates reported
           for the pointer.

   Identifier
           Each resource has an "identifier", a unique value associated
           with it that clients use to name the resource.  An identifier



<span class="grey">M.I.T.                                                          [Page 7]</span></pre>

           can be used over any connection to name the resource.

   Inferiors
           The "inferiors" of a window are all of the subwindows nested
           below it: the children, the children's children, etc.

   Input focus
           The "input focus" is nominally where keyboard input goes.
           Keyboard events are by default sent to the client expressing
           interest on the window the pointer is in.  This is said to be
           a "real estate driven" input focus.  It is also possible to
           attach the keyboard input to a  specific window; events will
           then be sent to the appropriate client independent of the
           pointer position.

   Input manager
           Control over keyboard input is typically provided by an
           "input manager" client.

   InputOnly window
           A window that cannot be used for graphics requests.
           InputOnly windows are "invisible", and can be used to control
           such things as cursors, input event generation, and grabbing.

   InputOutput window
           The "normal" kind of opaque window, used for both input
           and output.

   Key grabbing
           Keys on the keyboard may be passively "grabbed" by a client.
           When the key is pressed, the keyboard is then actively
           grabbed by the client.

   Keyboard grabbing
           A client can actively "grab" control of the keyboard, and key
           events will be sent to that client rather than the client the
           events would normally have been sent to.

   Mapping
           A window is said to be "mapped" if a map call has been
           performed on it.  Unmapped windows are never viewable or
           visible.

   Modifier keys
           Shift, Control, Meta, Super, Hyper, ALT, Compose, Apple,
           CapsLock, ShiftLock, and similar keys are called "modifier"
           keys.

   Obscures
           Window A "obscures" window B if both are viewable
           InputOutput windows and A is higher in the global stacking



<span class="grey">M.I.T.                                                          [Page 8]</span></pre>

           order, and the rectangle defined by the outside edges of
           intersects the rectangle defined by the outside edges of B.
           Note the (fine) distinction with "occludes". Also note that
           window borders are included in the calculation.

   Occludes
           Window A "occludes" window B if both are mapped and A is
           higher in the global stacking order, and the rectangle
           defined by the outside edges of A intersects the rectangle
           defined by the outside edges of B.  Note the (fine)
           distinction with "obscures".  Also note that window borders
           are included in the calculation.

   Padding
           Some padding bytes are inserted in the data stream to
           maintain alignment of the protocol requests on natural
           boundaries.  This increases ease of portability to some
           machine architectures.

   Parent window
           If C is a child of P, then P is the "parent" of C.

   Passive grab
           Grabbing a key or button is a "passive" grab.  The grab
           activates when the key or button is actually pressed.

   Pixel value
           A "pixel" is an N-bit value, where N is the number of bit
           planes used in a particular window or pixmap.  For a window,
           a pixel value indexes a colormap to derive an actual color
           to be displayed.

   Pixmap
           A "pixmap" is a three dimensional array of bits.  A pixmap
           is normally thought of as a two dimensional array of pixels,
           where each pixel can be a value from 0 to (2^N)-1, where N
           is the depth (z axis) of the pixmap.  A pixmap can also be
           thought of as a stack of N bitmaps.

   Plane mask
           Graphics operations can be restricted to only affect a
           subset of bit planes of a destination.  A "plane mask" is
           a bit mask describing which planes are to be modified, and
           is stored in a graphics context.

   Pointer
           The "pointer" is the pointing device attached to the cursor,
           and tracked on the screens.

   Pointer grabbing
           A client can actively "grab" control of the pointer, and



<span class="grey">M.I.T.                                                          [Page 9]</span></pre>

           button and motion events will be sent to that client rather
           than the client the events would normally have been sent to.

   Pointing device
           A "pointing device" is typically a mouse or tablet, or some
           other device with effective dimensional motion.  There is
           only one visible cursor is defined by the core protocol,
           and it tracks whatever pointing device is attached as the
           pointer.

   Property
           Windows may have associated "properties", consisting of a
           name, a type, a data format, and some data.  The protocol
           places no interpretation on properties, they are intended
           as a general-purpose naming mechanism for clients.  For
           example, clients might share information such as resize
           hints, program names, and icon formats with a window
           manager via properties.

   Property list
           The "property list" of a window is the list of properties
           that have been defined for the window.

   Redirecting control
           Window managers (or client programs) may wish to enforce
            window layout policy in various ways.  When a client
           attempts to change the size or position of a window, the
           operation may be "redirected" to a specified client,
           rather than the operation actually being performed.

   Reply
           Information requested by a client program is sent back to
           the client with a "reply".  Both events and replys are
           multipexed on the same connection.  Most requests do not
           generate replies.

   Request
           A command to the server is called a "request".  It is a
           single block of data sent over a connection.

   Resource
           Windows, pixmaps, cursors, fonts, graphics contexts, and
           colormaps are known as "resources".  They all have unique
           identifiers associated with them for naming purposes.  The
           lifetime of a resource is bounded by the lifetime of the
           connection over which the resource was created.

   Root
           The "root" of a pixmap or gcontext is the same as the root
           of whatever drawable was used when the pixmap or gcontext
           was created.  The "root" of a window is the root window



<span class="grey">M.I.T.                                                         [Page 10]</span></pre>

           under which the window was created.

   Root window
           Each screen has a "root window" covering it.  It cannot be
           reconfigured or unmapped, but otherwise acts as a full
           fledged window. A root window has no parent.

   Save set
           The "save set" of a client is a list of other client's
           windows which, if they are inferiors of one of the client's
           windows at connection close, should not be destroyed, and
           which should be remapped if it is unmapped.  Save sets are
           typically used by window managers to avoid lost windows if
           the manager should terminate abnormally.

   Screen
           A server may provide several independent "screens", which
           typically have physically independent monitors.  This would
           be the expected configuration when there is only a single
           keyboard and pointer shared among the screens.

   Server
           The "server" provides the basic windowing mechanism.  It
           handles IPC connections from clients, demultipexes graphics
           requests onto the screens, and multiplexes input back to the
           appropriate clients.

   Server grabbing
           The server can be "grabbed" by a single client for exclusive
           use. This prevents processing of any requests from other
           client connections until the grab is complete.  This is
           typically only a transient state for such things as
           rubber-banding and pop-up menus, or to execute requests
           indivisibly.

   Sibling
           Children of the same parent window are known as "sibling"
           windows.

   Stacking order
           Sibling windows may "stack" on top of each other.  Windows
           above both obscure and occlude lower windows.  This is
           similar to paper on a desk. The relationship between
           sibling windows is known as the "stacking order".

   Stipple
           A "stipple pattern" is a bitmap that is used to tile a
           region to serve as an additional clip mask for a fill
           operation with the foreground color.

   Tile
           A pixmap can be replicated in two dimensions to "tile"
           a region.  The pixmap itself is also known as a "tile".

   Timestamp
           A time value, expressed in milliseconds, typically since
           the last server reset.  Timestamp values wrap around (after
           about 49.7 days). The server, given its current time is
           represented by timestamp T, always interprets timestamps
           from clients by treating half of the timestamp space as
           being earlier in time than T, and half of the timestamp
           space as being later in time than T.  One timestamp value
           (named CurrentTime) is never generated by the server;
           this value is reserved for use in requests to represent
           the current server time.

   Type
           A type is an arbitrary atom used to identify the
           interpretation of property data.  Types are completely
           uninterpreted by the server; they are solely for the
           benefit of clients.

   Unviewable
           A window is "unviewable" if it is mapped but some ancestor is
           unmapped.

   Viewable
           A window is "viewable" if it and all of its ancestors are
           mapped.  This does not imply that any portion of the window
           is actually visible.

   Visible
           A region of a window is "visible" if someone looking at the
           screen can actually "see" it:  the window is viewable and the
           region is not occluded by any other window.

   Window gravity
           When windows are resized, subwindows may be repositioned
           automatically relative to some position in the window.  This
           attraction of a subwindow to some part of its parent is known
           as "window gravity".

   Window manager
           Manipulation of windows on the screen, and much of the user
           interface (policy) is typically provided by a "window
           manager" client.

   XYFormat
           The data for a pixmap is said to be in "XYFormat" if it is
           organized as a set of bitmaps representing individual bit
           planes.

<a href="#section-2">SECTION 2</a>.  PROTOCOL FORMATS


Request Format

   Every request contains an 8-bit "major" opcode, and a 16-bit length
   field expressed in units of 4 bytes.  Every request consists of 4
   bytes of header containing the major opcode, the length field, and a
   data byte) followed by zero or more additional bytes of data; the
   length field defines the total length of the request, including the
   header.  The length field in a request must equal the minimum length
   required to contain the request; if the specified length is smaller
   or larger than the required length, an error is enerated.  Unused
   bytes in a request are not required to be zero.  Major opcodes 128
   through 255 are reserved for extensions.  Extensions are intended
   to contain multiple requests, so extension requests typically have
   an additional minor opcode encoded in the "spare" data byte in the
   request header, but the placement and interpretation of this minor
   opcode, and all other fields in extension requests, are not defined
   by the core protocol. Every request is implicitly assigned a sequence
   number, starting with one,used in replies, errors, and events.

Reply Format

   Every reply contains a 32-bit length field expressed in units of 4
   bytes. Every reply consists of 32 bytes, followed by zero or more
   additional bytes of data, as specified in the length field.  Unused
   bytes within a reply are not guaranteed to be zero.  Every reply
   also contains the least significant 16 bits of the sequence number
   of the corresponding request.

Error Format

   Error reports are 32 bytes long.  Every error includes an 8-bit error
   code. Error codes 128 through 255 are reserved for extensions.  Every
   error also includes the major and minor opcodes of the failed
   request, and the least significant 16 bits of the sequence number of
   the request.  For the following errors (see <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>), the failing
   resource id is also returned: Colormap, Cursor, Drawable, Font,
   GContext, IDChoice, Pixmap, and Window.  For Atom errors, the failing
   atom is returned.  For Value errors, the failing value is returned.
   Other core errors return no additional data.  Unused bytes within
   an error are not guaranteed to be zero.

   most significant bit in this code is set if the event was generated
   from a SendEvent request. Event codes 64 through 127 are reserved for
   extensions, although the core protocol does not define a mechanism

   exception of KeymapNotify) also contains the least significant 16
   bits of the sequence number of the last request issued by the client
   that was (or is currently being) processed by the server.

<a href="#section-4">SECTION 4</a>.  COMMON TYPES


LISTofFOO

   A type name of the form LISTofFOO means a counted list of elements
   of type FOO; the size of the length field may vary (it is not
   necessarily the same size as a FOO), in some cases may be implicit,
   and is not fully specified in this document.

BITMASK and LISTofVALUE

   The types BITMASK and LISTofVALUE are somewhat special.  Various
   requests contain arguments of the form:
           value-mask: BITMASK
           value-list: LISTofVALUE
   used to allow the client to specify a subset of a heterogeneous
   collection of "optional" arguments.  The value-mask specifies which
   arguments are to be provided; each such argument is assigned a unique
   bit position.  The representation of the BITMASK will typically
   contain more bits than there are defined arguments; unused bits in
   the value-mask must be zero (or the server generates a Value error).
   The value-list contains one value for each one bit in the mask, from
   least to most significant bit in the mask.  Each value is represented
   with 4 bytes, but the actual value occupies only the least
   significant bytes as required; the values of the unused bytes do not
   matter.

Or Types

   A type of the form "T1 or ... or Tn" means the union of the indicated
   types; a single-element type is given as the element without
   enclosing braces.

DRAWABLE: WINDOW or PIXMAP
ATOM: 32-bit id (top 3 bits guaranteed to be zero)
VISUALID: 32-bit id (top 3 bits guaranteed to be zero)

   The primary interpretation of "large" characters in a STRING16 is
   that they are composed of two bytes used to index a 2-D matrix;
   hence the use of CHAR2B rather than CARD16.  This corresponds to
   the JIS/ISO method of indexing two-byte characters.  It is expected
   that most "large" fonts will be defined with two-byte matrix
   indexing.  For large fonts constructed with linear indexing, a
   CHAR2B can be interpreted as a 16-bit number by treating byte1 as
   the most significant byte; this means that clients should always
   transmit such 16-bit character values most significant byte first,
   as the server will never byte-swap CHAR2B quantities.

   The length, format, and interpretation of a HOST address are specific
   to the family.


<a href="#section-5">SECTION 5</a>.  ERRORS

   In general, when a request terminates with an error, the request has
   no side effects (i.e., there is no partial execution).  The only
   requests for which this is not true are ChangeWindowAttributes,
   ChangeGC, PolyText8, PolyText16, FreeColors, StoreColors, and
   ChangeKeyboardControl.

   The following error codes can be returned by the various requests:

Access
           An attempt to grab a key/button combination already grabbed
           by another client.

           An attempt to free a colormap entry not allocated by the
           client.

           An attempt to store into a read-only or an unallocated
           colormap entry.

           An attempt to modify the access control list from other than
           the local (or otherwise authorized) host.

           An attempt to select an event type, that at most one client
           can select at a time, when another client has already
           selected it.

Alloc
           The server failed to allocate the requested resource.

           Note that this only covers allocation errors at a very coarse
           level, and is not intended to (nor can it in practice hope
           to) cover all cases of a server running out of allocation
           space in the middle of service.





<span class="grey">M.I.T.                                                         [Page 17]</span></pre>

           The semantics when a server runs out of allocation space are
           left unspecified.

Atom
           A value for an ATOM argument does not name a defined ATOM.

Colormap
           A value for a COLORMAP argument does not name a defined
           COLORMAP.

Cursor
           A value for a CURSOR argument does not name a defined CURSOR.

Drawable
           A value for a DRAWABLE argument does not name a defined
           WINDOW or PIXMAP.

Font
           A value for a FONT or &lt;FONT or GCONTEXT&gt; argument does not
           name a defined FONT.

GContext
           A value for a GCONTEXT argument does not name a defined
           GCONTEXT.

IDChoice
           The value chosen for a resource identifier is either not
           included in the range assigned to the client, or is already
           in use.

Implementation
           The server does not implement some aspect of the request.  A
           server which generates this error for a core request is
           deficient.  As such, this error is not listed for any of the
           requests, but clients should be prepared to receive such
           errors, and handle or discard them.

Length
           The length of a request is shorter or longer than that
           required to minimally contain the arguments.

Match
           An InputOnly window is used as a DRAWABLE.

           Some argument (or pair of arguments) has the correct type and
           range, but fails to "match" in some other way required by the
           request.

Name
           A font or color of the specified name does not exist.

Pixmap
           A value for a PIXMAP argument does not name a defined PIXMAP.

Property
           The requested property does not exist for the specified
           window.

Request
           The major or minor opcode does not specify a valid request.

Value
           Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted
           by the request.  Unless a specific range is specified for an
           argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is
           accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can
           generate this error.

Window
           A value for a WINDOW argument does not name a defined WINDOW.


Note:  the Atom, Colormap, Cursor, Drawable, Font, GContext, Pixmap,
and Window errors are also used when the argument type is extended
by union with a set of fixed alternatives, e.g.,&lt;Window or
PointerRoot or None&gt;.

<a href="#section-6">SECTION 6</a>.  KEYBOARDS

   Keycodes are always in the inclusive range [8,255].

   For keyboards with both left-side and right-side modifier keys (e.g.,
   Shift and Control), the mask bits in the protocol always define the
   OR of the keys. If electronically distinguishable, they can have
   separate up/down events generated, and clients that want to
   distinguish can track the individual states manually.

   &lt;As part of the core we need to define a universal association
   between keycaps and keycodes.  A keycap is the graphical information
   imprinted on a keyboard key, e.g., "$ 4", "T", "+ =".&gt;


<a href="#section-7">SECTION 7</a>.  POINTERS

   Buttons are always numbered starting with one.


<a href="#section-8">SECTION 8</a>.  PREDEFINED ATOMS

   Predefined atoms are not strictly necessary, and may not be useful in
   all environments, but will eliminate many InternAtom requests in most
   applications.  The core protocol imposes no semantics on these names,

<a href="#section-9">SECTION 9</a>.  CONNECTION SETUP

   For remote clients, the X protocol can be built on top of any
   reliable byte stream.  For TCP connections, displays on a given host
   a numbered starting from 0, and the server for display N listens and
   accepts connections on port 6000+N.

   The client must send an initial byte of data to identify the byte
   order to be employed.  The value of the byte must be octal 102 or
   154.  The value 102 (ASCII uppercase B) means values are transmitted
   most significant byte first, and value 154 (ASCII lowercase l) means
   values are transmitted least significant byte first.  Except where
   explicitly noted in the protocol, all 16-bit and 32-bit quantities
   sent by the client must be transmitted with this byte order, and all
   16-bit and 32-bit quantities returned by the server will be
   transmitted with this byte order.

   Following the byte-order byte, the following information is sent by
   the client at connection setup:

           protocol-major-version: CARD16
           protocol-minor-version: CARD16
           authorization-protocol-name: STRING8
           authorization-protocol-data: STRING8

           The version numbers indicate what version of the protocol the
           client expects the server to implement.  See below for an



<span class="grey">M.I.T.                                                         [Page 20]</span></pre>

           explanation. The authorization name indicates what
           authorization protocol the client expects the server to use,
           and the data is specific to that protocol. Specification of
           valid authorization mechanisms is not part of the core X
           protocol.  It is hoped that eventually one authorization
           protocol will be agreed upon.  In the mean time, a server
           that implements a different protocol than the client expects,
           or a server that only implements the host-based mechanism,
           will simply ignore this information.

   Received by the client at connection setup:
           success: BOOL
           protocol-major-version: CARD16
           protocol-minor-version: CARD16
           length: CARD16

           Length is the amount of additional data to follow, in units
           of 4 bytes. The version numbers are an escape hatch in case
           future revisions of the protocol are necessary.  In general,
           the major version would increment for incompatible changes,
           and the minor version would increment for small upward
           compatible changes.  Barring changes, the major version
           will be eleven, and the minor version will be zero.  The
           protocol version numbers returned indicate the protocol the
           server actually supports.  This might not equal the version
           sent by the client.  The server can (but need not) refuse
           connections from clients that offer a different version
           than the server supports.  A server can (but need not)
           support more than one version simultaneously.

   Per server information:

   The vendor string gives some indentification of the owner of the
   server implementation.  The semantics of the release-number is
   controlled by the vendor.

   The resource-id-mask contains a single contiguous set of bits (at
   least 18); the client allocates resource ids by choosing a value
   with (only) some subset of these bits set, and ORing it with
   resource-id-base.  Only values constructed in this way can be
   used to name newly created resources over this connection.
   Resource ids never have the top 3 bits set.  The client is not
   restricted to linear or contiguous allocation of resource ids.
   Once an id has been freed, it can be reused, but this should not
   be necessary. An id must be unique with respect to the ids of
   all other resources, not just other resources of the same type.

   Although the server is in general responsible for byte swapping
   data to match the client, images are always transmitted and
   received in formats (including byte order) specified by the
   server.  The byte order for images is given by image-byte-order,
   and applies to each scanline unit in XYFormat (bitmap) format,
   and to each pixel value in ZFormat.

   A bitmap is represented in scanline order.  Each scanline is padded
   to a multiple of bits as given by bitmap-format-scanline-pad.  The

   pad bits are of arbitrary value.  The scanline is quantized in
   multiples of bits as given by bitmap-format-scanline-unit.  Within
   each unit, the leftmost bit in the bitmap is either the least or
   most significant bit in the unit, as given by
   bitmap-format-bit-order.  If a pixmap is represented in XYFormat,
   each plane is represented as a bitmap, and the planes appear from
   most to least significant in bit order.

   For each pixmap depth supported by some screen, pixmap-formats lists
   the ZFormat used to represent images of that depth.  In ZFormat, the
   pixels are in scanline order, left to right within a scanline.  The
   number of bits used to hold each pixel is given by bits-per-pixel,
   and may be larger than strictly required by the depth.  When the
   bits-per-pixel is 4, the order of nibbles in the byte is the same as
   the image byte-order.  Each scanline is padded to a multiple of bits
   as given by scanline-pad.

   How a pointing device roams the screens is up to the server
   implementation, and is transparent to the protocol.  No geometry
   among screens is defined.

   The server may retain the recent history of pointer motion, and to a
   finer granularity than is reported by MotionNotify events.  Such
   history is available via the GetPointerMotions request.  The
   approximate size of the history buffer is given by
   motion-buffer-size.

   Maximum-request-length specifies the maximum length of a request, in
   4-byte units, accepted by the server; i.e., this is the maximum value
   that can appear in the length field of a request.  Requests larger
   than this generate a Length error, and the server will read and
   simply discard the entire request.  Maximum-request-length will
   always be at least 4096 (i.e., requests of length up to and including
   16384 bytes will be accepted by all servers).

   Per screen information:

   The allowed-depths specifies what pixmap and window depths are
   supported.  Pixmaps are supported for each depth listed, and windows
   of that depth are supported if at least one visual type is listed for
   the depth.  A pixmap depth of one is always supported and listed, but
   windows of depth one might not be supported.  A depth of zero is
   never listed, but zero-depth InputOnly windows are always supported.

   Root-depth and root-visual specify the depth and visual type of the
   root window.  Width-in-pixels and height-in-pixels specify the size
   of the root window (which cannot be changed).  The class of the root
   window is always InputOutput.  Width-in-millimeters and
   height-in-millimeters can be used to determine the physical size and
   the aspect ratio.

   The default-colormap is the one initially associated with the root
   window.  Clients with minimal color requirements creating windows of
   the same depth as the root may want to allocate from this map by
   default.

   Black-pixel and white-pixel can be used in implementing a
   "monochrome" application.  These pixel values are for permanently
   allocated entries in the default-colormap; the actual RGB values may
   be settable on some screens.

   The border of the root window is initially a pixmap filled with the
   black-pixel.  The initial background of the root window is a pixmap
   filled with some unspecified two-color pattern using black-pixel and
   white-pixel.

   Min-installed-maps specifies the number of maps that can be
   guaranteed to installed simultaneously (with InstallColormap),
   regardless of the number of entries allocated in each map.
   Max-installed-maps specifies the maximum number of maps that might
   possibly be installed simultaneously, depending on their
   allocations. For the typical case of a single hardware colormap,
   both values will be one.

   Backing-stores indicates when the server supports backing stores for
   this screen, although it may be storage limited in the number of
   windows it can support at once.  If save-unders is True, then the a
   server can support the save-under mode in CreateWindow and
   ChangeWindowAttributes, although again it may be storage limited.

   The current-input-events is what GetWindowAttributes would return for
   the all-event-masks for the root window.

   Per visual-type information:

   A given visual type might be listed for more than one depth, or for
   more than one screen.

   For PseudoColor, a pixel value indexes a colormap to produce
   independent RGB values; the RGB values can be changed dynamically.
   GrayScale is treated the same as PseudoColor, except which primary
   drives the screen is undefined, so the client should always store
   the same value for red, green, and blue in colormaps.  For
   DirectColor, a pixel value is decomposed into separate RGB
   subfields, and each subfield separately indexes the colormap for
   the corresponding value; The RGB values can be changed dynamically.
   TrueColor is treated the same as DirectColor, except the colormap
   has predefined read-only RGB values, which are server-dependent,
   but provide (near-)linear ramps in each primary.  StaticColor is
   treated the same as PseudoColor, except the colormap has
   predefined read-only RGB values, which are server-dependent.
   StaticGray is treated the same as StaticColor, except the red,

   green, and blue values are equal for any single pixel value,
   resulting in shades of gray.  StaticGray with a two-entry colormap
   can be thought of as "monochrome".

   The red-mask, green-mask, and blue-mask are only defined for
   DirectColor and TrueColor; each has one contiguous set of bits, with
   no intersections.

   The bits-per-rgb-value specifies the log base 2 of the approximate
   number of distinct color values (individually) of red, green, and
   blue. Actual RGB values are always passed in the protocol within a
   16-bit spectrum.

   The colormap-entries defines the number of available colormap entries
   in a newly created colormap.  For DirectColor and TrueColor, this
   will usually be the size of an individual pixel subfield.

           A class of CopyFromParent means the class is taken from the

           processing, and VisibilityNotify events.  An InputOnly window
           cannot be used as a drawable (as a source or destination for
           graphics requests).  InputOnly and InputOutput windows act
           identically in other respects (properties, grabs, input
           control, and so on).

           The window is placed on top in the stacking order with
           respect to siblings.  The x and y coordinates are relative
           to the parent's origin, and specify the position of the upper
           left outer corner of the window (not the origin).  The width
           and height specify the inside size, not including the border,
           and must be non-zero.  The border-width for an InputOnly
           window must be zero (else a Match error).

           The value-mask and value-list specify attributes of the
           window that are to be explicitly initialized.  The possible
           values are:

               background-pixmap: PIXMAP or None or ParentRelative

           Only the following attributes are defined for InputOnly
           windows: win-gravity, event-mask, do-not-propagate-mask,
           and cursor.  It is a Match error to specify any other
           attributes for InputOnly windows.

           If background-pixmap is given, it overrides the default
           background-pixel.  The background pixmap and the window must
           have the same root and the same depth (else a Match error).
           Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizes may be
           faster than others.  If background None is specifed, the
           window has no defined background.  If background
           ParentRelative is specified, the parent's background is
           used, but the window must have the same depth as the parent
           (else a Match error); if the parent has background None,
           then the window will also have background None.  A copy
           of the parent's background is not made; the parent's
           background is reexamined each time the window background is
           required.  If background-pixel is given, it overrides the
           default and any background-pixmap given, and a pixmap of
           undefined size filled with background-pixel is used for the
           background.  For a  ParentRelative background, the
           background tile origin always aligns with the parent's
           background tile origin; otherwise the background tile
           origin is always the window origin.

           When regions of the window are exposed and the server has
           not retained the contents, the server automatically tiles
           the regions with the window's background unless the window
           has a background of None, in which case the previous screen
           contents are simply left in place. Exposure events are then
           generated for the regions, even if the  background is None.

           The border tile origin is always the same as the background
           tile origin.  If border-pixmap is given, it overrides the
           default border-pixel.  The border pixmap and the window must
           have the same root and the same depth (else a Match error).
           Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizes may faster
           than others.  If CopyFromParent is given, the parent's border
           pixmap is copied (subsequent changes to the parent do not
           affect the child), but the window must have the same depth
           as the parent (else a Match error).  If border-pixel is
           given, it overrides the default and any border-pixmap given,
           and a pixmap of undefined size filled with border-pixel is
           used for the border.

           Output to a window is always clipped to the inside of the
           window, so that the border is never affected.

           The bit-gravity defines which region of the window should be
           retained if the window is resized, and win-gravity defines
           how the window should be repositioned if the parent is

           A backing-store of WhenMapped advises the server that
           maintaining contents of obscured regions when the window
           is mapped would be beneficial.  A backing-store of Always
           advises the server that maintaining contents even when the
           window is unmapped would be beneficial.  Note that, even if
           the window is larger than its parent, the server should
           maintain complete contents, not just the region within the
           parent boundaries.  If the server maintains contents,
           Exposure events will not be generated, but the server may
           stop maintaining contents at any time.  A value of NotUseful
           advises the server that maintaining contents is unnecessary,
           although a server may still choose to maintain contents.

           Backing-bit-planes indicates (with one bits) which bit
           planes of the window hold dynamic data that must be preserved
           in backing-stores. Backing-pixel specifies what value to use
           in planes not covered by backing-bit-planes.  The server is
           free to only save the specified bit planes in the
           backing-store, and regenerate the remaining planes with the
           specified pixel value.

           If save-under is True, the server is advised that, when
           this window is mapped, saving the contents of windows it
           obscures would be beneficial.

           The event-mask defines which events the client is interested
           in for this window (or, for some event types, inferiors of
           the window).  The do-not-propagate-mask defines which events
           should not be propagated to ancestor windows when no client
           has the event type selected in this window.

           Override-redirect specifies whether map and configure
           request on this window should override a SubstructureRedirect
           on the parent, typically to inform a window manager not to
           tamper with the window.

           The colormap specifies the colormap, that best reflects the
           "true" colors of the window.  Servers capable of supporting
           hardware colormaps may use this information, and window
           managers may use it for InstallColormap requests.  The
           colormap must have the same visual type as the window
           (else a match error). If CopyFromParent is specified, the
           parents's colormap is copied (subsequent changes to the

           If a cursor is specified, it will be used whenever the
           pointer is in the window.  If None is specified, the
           parent's cursor will be used when the pointer is in the
           window, and any change in the parent's cursor will
           cause an immediate change in the display cursor.

           This request generates a CreateNotify event.

           The background and border pixmaps and the cursor may be
           freed immediately if no further explicit references to
           them are to be made.

           Subsequent drawing into the background or border pixmap has
           an undefined effect on the window state; the server might or
           might not make a copy of the pixmap.

          Errors: Window, Pixmap, Colormap, Cursor, Match, Value,
                  Access

          The value-mask and value-list specify which attributes are
          to be changed.  The values and restrictions are the same
          as for CreateWindow.

          Changing the background does not cause the window contents
          to be changed.  Setting the border, or changing the
          background such that border tile origin changes, causes the
          border to be repainted. Changing the background of a root
          window to None or ParentRelative restores the default
          background pixmap. Changing the border of a root window to
          CopyFromParent restores the default border pixmap.

           Changing the back-store of an obsecured window to
           WhenMapped or Always, or changing the backing-bit-planes,
           backing-pixel, or save-under of a mapped window, may have
           no immediate effect.

           Multiple clients can select input on the same window; their
           event-masks are disjoint.  When an event is generated it
           will be reported to all interested clients.  However, at
           most one client at a time can select for
           SubstructureRedirect, at most one client at a time can
           select for ResizeRedirectr, and at most one client at a
           time can select for ButtonPress.

           There is only one do-not-propagate-mask for a window, not
           one per client.

           Changing the colormap of a window (i.e., defining a new map,
           not changing the contents of the existing map) generates a
           ColormapNorify event.  Changing the colormap os a visible
           window may have no immediate effect on the screen; see
           InstallColormap.

           Changing the cursor of a root window to None restores the
           default cursor.

           The order in which attributes are verified and altered is
           server dependent. If an error is generated, a subset of
           the attributes may have been altered.

           Adds or removes the specified window from the client's
           "save-set".  The window must have been created by some other
           client (else a Match error).  The use of the save-set is
           described in <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>.

           Windows are removed automatically from the save-set by the
           server when they are destroyed.

ReparentWindow
           window, parent: WINDOW
           x, y: INT16

           Errors: Window, Match

           If the window is mapped, an UnmapWindow request is
           performed automatically first.  The window is then removed
           from its current position in the hierarchy, and is inserted
           as a child of the specified parent.  The x and y coordinates
           are relative to the parent's origin, and specify the new
           position of the upper left outer corner of the window.  The
           window is placed on top in the stacking order with respect
           to siblings.  A ReparentNotify event is then generated.  The
           override-redirect attribute of the window is passed on in
           this event; a value of True indicates that a window manager
           should not tamper with this window.  Finally, if the window
           was originally mapped, a MapWindow request is performed
           automatically.

           Normal exposure processing on formerly obscured windows is
           performed. The server might not generate exposure events for
           regions from the initial unmap that are immediately obscured
           by the final map.

           A Match error is generated if the new parent is not on the
           same screen as the old parent, or if the new parent is the

           has a ParentRelative background and the new parent is not

MapWindow
           window: WINDOW

           Errors: Window

           If the window is already mapped, this request has no effect.

           If the override-redirect attribute of the window is False and
           some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect on the
           parent, then a MapRequest event is generated, but the window
           remains unmapped. Otherwise, the window is mapped and a
           MapNotify event is generated.

           If the window is now viewable and its contents had been
           discarded, then the window is tiled with its background (if
           no background is defined the existing screen contents are not
           altered) and one or more exposure events are generated.  If a
           backing-store has been maintained while the window was
           unmapped, no exposure events are generated. If a
           backing-store will now be maintained, a full-window exposure
           is always generated; otherwise only visible regions may be
           reported. Similar tiling and exposure take place for any
           newly viewable inferiors.

MapSubwindows

           Changes the configuration of the window.  The value-mask and
           value-list specify which values are to be given.  The
           possible values are:

               x: INT16
               y: INT16
               width: CARD16

               sibling: WINDOW
               stack-mode: {Above, Below, TopIf, BottomIf, Opposite}

           The x and y coordinates are relative to the parent's origin,
           and specify the position of the upper left outer corner of
           the window. The width and height specify the inside size,
           not including the border, and must be non-zero.  It is a
           Match error to attempt to make the border-width of an
           InputOnly window non-zero.

           If the override-redirect attribute of the window is False
           and some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect on
           the parent, then a ConfigureRequest event is generated, and
           no further processing is performed.  Otherwise, the following
           is performed.

           If some other client has selected ResizeRedirect on the
           window and the width or height of the window is being
           changed, then a ResizeRequest event is generated, and the
           current width and height are used instead in the following.

           The geometry of the window is changed as specified and the
           window is restacked among siblings as described below, and a
           ConfigureNotify event is generated.  If the width or height
           of the window has actually changed, then children of the
           window are affected as described below.

           Exposure processing is performed on formerly obscured
           windows.

           Changing the width or height of the window causes its
           contents to be moved or lost, depending on the bit-gravity of

           the window, and causes children to be reconfigured, depending
           on their win-gravity.  For a change of width and height of W
           and H, we define the [x, y] pairs:

               NorthWest: [0, 0]
               North: [W/2, 0]
               NorthEast: [W, 0]
               West: [0, H/2]
               Center: [W/2, H/2]
               East: [W, H/2]
               SouthWest: [0, H]
               South: [W/2, H]
               SouthEast: [W, H]

           When a window with one of these bit-gravities is resized, the
           corresponding pair defines the change in position of each
           pixel in the window.  When a window with one of these
           win-gravities has its parent window resized, the
           corresponding pair defines the change in position of the
           window within the parent.  When a window is so repositioned,
           a GravityNotify event is generated.

           A gravity of Static indicates that the contents or origin
           should not move relative to the origin of the root window. If
           the change in size of the window is coupled with a change in
           position of [X, Y], then for bit-gravity the change in
           position of each pixel is [-X, -Y], and for win-gravity the
           change in position of a child when its parent is so resized
           is [-X, -Y].  Note that Static gravity still only takes
           effect when the width or height of the window is changed, not
           when the window is simply moved.

           A bit-gravity of Forget indicates that the window contents
           are always discarded after a size change; the window is tiled
           with its background (if no background is defined, the
           existing screen contents are not altered) and one or more
           exposure events are generated.  A server may also ignore the
           specified bit-gravity and use Forget instead.

           A win-gravity of Unmap is like NorthWest, but the child is
           also unmapped when the parent is resized, and an UnmapNotify
           event is generated.

           If a sibling and a stack-mode is specified, the window is
           restacked as follows:

               Above:  window is placed just above sibling
               Below:  window is placed just below sibling
               TopIf:  if sibling occludes window, then window is placed

                          bottom of the stack

           If a stack-mode is specified but no sibling is specified, the
           window is restacked as follows:

               Above:  window is placed at the top of the stack
               Below:  window is placed at the bottom of the stack
               TopIf:  if any sibling occludes window, then window is

                         placed at the bottom of the stack

                         occludes any sibling, then window is placed at
                         the bottom of the stack

           It is a Match error if a sibling is specified without a
           stack-mode, or if the window is not actually a sibling.

           Note that the computations for BottomIf, TopIf, and Opposite
           are performed with respect to the window's final geometry
           (as controlled by the other arguments to the request), not
           its initial geometry.

           Errors: Drawable

           Returns the root and (current) geometry of the drawable.
           Depth is the number of bits per pixel for the object.
           X, y, and border-width will always be zero for pixmaps.
           For a window, the x and y coordinates specify the upper
           left outer corner of the window relative to its parent's
           origin, and the width and height specify the inside size
           (not including the border).

           It is legal to pass an InputOnly window as a drawable to
           this request.

           Returns the atom for the given name.  If only-if-exists is
           False, then the atom is created if it does not exist.  The
           string should use the ASCII encoding, and upper/lower case
           matters.

           The lifetime of an atom is not tied to the interning client.

ChangeProperty

           data: LISTofINT8 or LISTofINT16 or LISTofINT32

           Errors: Window, Atom, Value, Match, Alloc

           Alters the property for the specified window.  The type is
           uninterpreted by the server.  The format specifies whether
           the data should be viewed as a list of 8-bit, 16-bit, or
           32-bit quantities, so that the server can correctly
           byte-swap as necessary.

           If mode is Replace, the previous property value is discarded.
           If the mode is Prepend or Append, then the type and format
           must match the existing property value (else a Match error);
           if the property is undefined, it is treated as defined with
           the correct type and format with zero-length data.  For
           Prepend, the data is tacked on to the beginning of the
           existing data, and for Append it is tacked on to the
           end of the existing data.

           Generates a PropertyNotify event on the window.

           The lifetime of a property is not tied to the storing client.
           Properties remain until explicitly deleted, or the window is
           destroyed, or until server reset (see <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>).

           The maximum size of a property is server dependent.

           Errors: Window, Atom, Property, Match, Value

           If the specified property does not exist for the specifed
           window, a Property error is generated.  Otherwise, if type
           AnyPropertyType is specified, (part of) the property is
           returned regardless of its type; if a type is specified,
           (part of) the property is returned only if its type equals
           the specified type (else a Match error).  The actual type
           and format of the property are returned.

           Define the following values:
                   N = actual length of the stored property in bytes
                       (even if the format is 16 or 32)
                   I = 4 * long-offset
                   T = N - I
                   L = MINIMUM(T, 4 * long-length)
                   A = N - (I + L)
           The returned value starts at byte index I in the property
           (indexing from 0), and its length in bytes is L.  It is a
           Value error if long-offset is given such that L is negative.
           The value of bytes-after is A, giving the number of trailing
           unread bytes in the stored property.

           If delete is True and bytes-after is zero, the property is
           also deleted from the window and a PropertyNotify event is
           generated on the window.

RotateProperties

           Errors: Window, Atom, Match

           If the property names in the list are viewed as being
           numbered starting from zero, and there are N property names
           in the list, then the value associated with property name I
           becomes the value associated with property name (I + delta)
           mod N, for all I from zero to N - 1.  The effect is to rotate
           the states by delta places around the virtual ring of
           property names (right for positive delta, left for negative
           delta).

           A PropertyNotify event is generated for each property, in the
           order listed.

           If an atom occurs more than once in the list or no property
           with that name is defined for the window, a Match error is

           Error: Atom, Window

           Changes the owner and last-change time of the specifed

           is earlier than the current last-change time of the specified
           selection or is later than the current server time;
           otherwise, the last-change time is set to the specified time,
           with CurrentTime replaced by the current server time.
           If the new owner is not the same as the current owner of the
           selection, and the current owner is a window, then the
           current owner is sent a SelectClear event.

           If the owner of a selection is a window, and the window is
           later destroyed, the owner of the selection automatically
           reverts to None, but the last-change time is not affected.

           If the specified selection is owned by a window, the server
           sends a SelectionRequest event to the owner.  If no owner for
           the specified selection exists, the server generates a

           destination is replaced with the window that the pointer is
           in, and otherwise destination is replaced with the focus
           window.

           If propagate is False, then the event is sent to every client
           selecting on destination any of the event types in
           event-mask.

           If propagate is True and no clients have selected on
           destination any of the event types in event-mask, then
           destination is replaced with the closest ancestor of
           destination for which some client has selected a type in
           event-mask and no intervening window has that type in its
           do-not-propagate-mask.  If no such window exists, or if the
           window is an ancestor of the focus window and InputFocus was
           originally specified sent to any clients. Otherwise, the
           event is reported to every client selecting on the final
           destination any of the types specified in event-mask.

           The event code must be one of the core events, or one of
           the events defined by an extension, so that the server can
           correctly byte swap the contents as necessary.  The
           contents of the event are otherwise unaltered and unchecked
           by the server except to force on the most significant bit
           of the event code.

           Errors: Cursor, Window, Value

           Actively grabs control of the pointer.  Further pointer
           events are only reported to the grabbing client.  The
           request overrides any active pointer grab by this client.

           Event-mask is always augmented to include ButtonPress and
           ButtonRelease.  If owner-events is False, all generated
           pointer events are reported with respect to grab-window,
           and are only reported if selected by event-mask.  If
           owner-events is True, then if a generated pointer event
           would normally be reported to this client, it is reported
           normally; otherwise the event is reported with respect to
           the grab-window, and is only reported if selected by
           event-mask.  For either value of owner-events, unreported
           events are simply discarded.

           Pointer-mode controls further processing of pointer events,
           and keyboard-mode controls further processing of keyboard
           events.  If the mode is Asynchronous, event processing
           continues normally; if the device is currently frozen by
           this client, then processing of events for the device is
           resumed.  If the mode is Synchronous, the device (as seen
           via the protocol) appears to freeze, and no further events
           for that device are generated by the server until the
           grabbing client issues a releasing AllowEvents request.
           Actual device changes are not lost while the device is
           frozen; they are simply queued for later processing.

           If a cursor is specified, then it is displayed regardless
           of what window the pointer is in.  If no cursor is
           specified, then when the pointer is in grab-window or one
           of its subwindows, the normal cursor for that window is
           displayed, and otherwise the cursor for grab-window is
           displayed.

           If a confine-to window is specified, then the pointer
           will be restricted to stay contained in that window.
           The confine-to  window need have no relationship to the
           grab-window.  If the pointer is not initially in the
           confine-to window, then it is warped automatically to
           the closest edge (and enter/leave events generated
           normally) just  before the grab activates.  If the
           confine-to window is subsequently reconfigured, the
           pointer will be warped automatically as necessary to keep
           it contained in the window.

           This request generates EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events.

           The request fails with status AlreadyGrabbed if the
           pointer is actively grabbed by some other client.  The
           request fails with status Frozen if the pointer is frozen
           by an active grab of another client.  The request fails
           with status NotViewable if grab-window or
           confine-to window is not viewable.  The request fails with
           status InvalidTime if the specified time is earlier than
           the last-pointer-grab time or later than the current
           server time; otherwise the last-pointer-grab time is set
           to the specified time, with CurrentTime replaced by the
           current server time.

UngrabPointer
           time: TIMESTAMP or CurrentTime

           Releases the pointer if this client has it actively
           grabbed (from either GrabPointer or GrabButton or from a
           normal button press), and releases any queued events. The
           request has no effect if the specified time is earlier
           than the last-pointer-grab time or is later than the
           current server time.

           This request generates EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events.

           An UngrabPointer is performed automatically if the event

           Errors: Cursor, Window, Value, Access

           This request establishes a passive grab.  In the future,
           if the specified button is pressed when the specified
           modifier keys are down (and no other buttons or modifier
           keys are down), and grab-window contains the pointer,
           and the confine-to window (if any) is viewable, and these
           constraints are not satisfied for any ancestor, then the
           pointer is actively grabbed as described in GrabPointer,
           the last-pointer-grab time is set to the time at which
           the button was pressed (as transmitted in the ButtonPress
           event), and the ButtonPress event is reported.  The
           interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for
           GrabPointer.  The active grab is terminated automatically
           when all buttons are released (independent of the state
           of modifier keys).

           A modifiers of AnyModifier is equivalent to issuing the
           request for all possible modifier combinations.  A
           button of AnyButton is equivalent to issuing the request
           for all possible buttons.

           An Access error is generated if some other client has
           already issued a GrabButton with the same button/key
           combination on the same window. When using AnyModifier
           or AnyButton, the request fails completely (no grabs are

           Actively grabs control of the keyboard.  Further key
           events are reported only to the grabbing client.  The
           request overrides any active keyboard grab by this
           client.

           If owner-events is False, all generated key events are
           reported with respect to grab-window.  If owner-events is
           True, then if a generated key event would normally be
           reported to this client, it is reported normally;
           otherwise the event is reported with respect to the
           grab-window.  Both KeyPress and KeyRelease events are
           always reported, independent of any event selection made
           by the client.

           Pointer-mode controls further processing of pointer
           events, and keyboard-mode controls further processing of
           keyboard events.  If the mode is Asynchronous, event
           processing continues normally; if the device is currently
           frozen by this client, then processing of events for the
           device is resumed.  If the mode is Synchronous, the
           device (as seen via the protocol) appears to freeze, and
           no further events for that device are generated by the
           server until the grabbing client issues a releasing
           AllowEvents request.  Actual device changes are not lost
           while the device is frozen; they are simply queued for
           later processing.

           If None is specified as the focus, all keyboard events are

           Returns a bit vector for the keyboard; each one bit
           indicates that the corresponding key is currently pressed.
           The vector is represented as 32 bytes.  Byte N (from 0)
           contains the bits for keys 8N to 8N+7, with the least
           significant bit in the byte representing key 8N.

           Errors: Font

           Returns logical information about a font.

           The draw-direction is essentially just a hint, indicating
           whether most char-infos have a positive (LeftToRight) or a
           negative (RightToLeft)  character-width metric.  The core
           protocol defines no support for vertical text.

           If min-byte1 and max-byte1 are both zero, then
           min-char-or-byte2 specifies the linear character index
           corresponding to the first elementb of char-infos, and
           max-char-or-byte2 specifies the linear character index of
           the last element.  If either min-byte1 or max-byte1 are
           non-zero, then both min-char-or-byte2 and
           max-char-or-byte2 will be less than 256, and the two-byte
           character index values corresponding to char-infos element
           N (counting from 0) are
               byte1 = N/D + min-byte1
               byte2 = N\D + min-char-or-byte2
           where
               D = max-char-or-byte2 - min-char-or-byte2 + 1
               / = integer division
               \ = integer modulus

           If char-infos has length zero, then min-bounds and
           max-bounds will be identical, and the effective
           char-infos is one filled with this char-info, of length
               L = D * (max-byte1 - min-byte1 + 1)
           That is, all glyphs in the specified linear or matrix
           range have the same information, as given by min-bounds
           (and max-bounds). If all-chars-exist is True, then all
           characters in char-infos have non-zero bounding boxes.

           The default-char specifies the character that will be
           used when an undefined or non-existent character is used.
           Note that default-char is a CARD16 (not CHAR2B); for a
           font using two-byte matrix format, the default-char has
           byte1 in the most significant byte, and byte2 in the
           least significant byte.  If the default-char itself
           specifies an undefined or non-existent character, then
           no printing is performed for an undefined or non-existent
           character.

           The min-bounds and max-bounds contain the minimum and
           maximum values of each individual CHARINFO component over
           all char-infos (ignoring non-existent characters).  The
           bounding box of the font, i.e., the smallest rectangle
           enclosing the shape obtained  by superimposing all
           characters at the same origin [x,y], has  its upper left
           coordinate at

                    left-side-bearing and a height of
               max-bounds.ascent + max-bounds.descent

           The font-ascent is the logical extent of the font above
           the baseline, for determining line spacing.  Specific
           characters may extend beyond this.  The font-descent is
           the logical extent of the font at or below the baseline,
           for determining line spacing. Specific characters may
           extend beyond this.  If the baseline is at Y-coordinate
           y, then the logical extent of the font is inclusive
           between the Y-coordinate values (y - font-ascent) and
           (y + font-descent - 1).

           A font is not guaranteed to have any properties.  Whether
           a property value is signed or unsigned must be derived
           from a prior knowledge of the property.  When possible,
           fonts should have at least the following properties (note
           that the trailing colon is not part of the name, and that
           upper/lower case matters).

           MIN_SPACE: CARD32
              The minimum interword spacing, in pixels.
           NORM_SPACE: CARD32
               The normal interword spacing, in pixels.
           MAX_SPACE: CARD32
               The maximum interword spacing, in pixels
           SUBSCRIPT_X: INT32
           SUBSCRIPT_Y: INT32
               Offsets from the character origin where subscripts
               should begin, in pixels.  If the origin is at [x,y],
               then subscripts should begin at [x + SubscriptX,
                   y + SubscriptY].
           UNDERLINE_POSITION: INT32
               Y offset from the baseline to the top of an underline,
               in pixels. If the baseline is Y-coordinate y, then
               the top of the underline is at (y +
                    UnderlinePosition).
           UNDERLINE_THICKNESS: CARD32
               Thickness of the underline, in pixels.
           STRIKEOUT_ASCENT: INT32
           STRIKEOUT_DESCENT: INT32
               Vertical extents for boxing or voiding characters, in
               pixels.  If the baseline is at Y-coordinate y, then
               the top of the strikeout box is at (y -
               StrikeoutAscent), and the height of the box is
               (StrikeoutAscent +  StrikeoutDescent).
           ITALIC_ANGLE: INT32
               The angle of characters in the font, in degrees

           QUAD_WIDTH: INT32
               "1 em" as in TeX, but expressed in units of pixels.
               Often the width of the digits 0-9.
           WEIGHT: CARD32
               The weight or boldness of the font, expressed as a
               value between 0 and 1000.
           POINT_SIZE: CARD32
               The point size, expressed in 1/10ths, of this font at
               the ideal resolution.  There are 72.27 points to the
               inch.
           RESOLUTION: CARD32
               The number of pixels per point, expressed in 1/100ths,
               at which this font was created.

           For a character origin at [x,y], the bounding box of a
           character,i.e., the smallest rectangle enclosing the
           character's shape,  described in terms of CHARINFO
           components, is a rectangle with its upper left corner at
                   [x + left-side-bearing, y - ascent]
           with a width of
                   right-side-bearing - left-side-bearing
           and a height of
                   ascent + descent
           and the origin for the next character is defined to be
                   [x + character-width, y]
           Note that the baseline is logically viewed as being just
           below non-descending characters (when descent is zero,
           only pixels with Y-coordinates less than y are drawn),
           and that the origin is logically viewed as being
           coincident with the left edge of a non-kerned character
           (when left-side-bearing is zero, no pixels with
           X-coordinate less than x are drawn).

           Note that CHARINFO metric values can be negative.

           A non-existent character is represented with all CHARINFO
           components zero.

           The interpretation of the per-character attributes field
           is undefined by the core protocol.

           Returns the logical extents of the specified string of
           characters in the specified font.  Draw-direction,
           font-ascent, and font-descent are as described in
           QueryFont.  Overall-ascent is the maximum of the ascent
           metrics of all characters in the string, and
           overall-descent is the maximum of the descent metrics.
           Overall-width is the sum of the character-width metrics
           of all characters in the string.  For each character in
           the string, let W be the sum of the character-width
           metrics of all characters preceding it in the string,
           let L be the left-side-bearing metric of the character
           plus W, and let R be the right-side-bearing metric of
           the character plus W.  Overall-left is the minimum L of
           all characters in the string, and overall-right is the
           maximum R.

           For fonts defined with linear indexing rather than
           two-byte matrix indexing, the server will interpret each
           CHAR2B as a 16-bit number that has been transmitted most
           significant byte first (i.e., byte1 of the CHAR2B is
           taken as the most significant byte).

           If the font has no defined default-char, then undefined
           characters in   the string are taken to have all zero
           metrics.

           In graphics operations, given a source and destination pixel,
           the result is computed bitwise on corresponding bits of the
           pixels.  That is, a boolean operation is performed in each
           bit plane. The plane-mask restricts the operation to a subset
           of planes.  That is, the result is

           ((src FUNC dst) AND plane-mask) OR (dst AND (NOT plane-mask))

           Range checking is not performed on the values for foreground,
           background, or plane-mask; they are simply truncated to the
           appropriate number of bits.

           The meanings of the alu-functions are:

           Line-width is measured in pixels and can be greater than or
           equal to one (a "wide" line) or the special value zero (a
           "thin" line).

           Wide lines are drawn centered on the path described by the
           graphics request.  Unless otherwise specified by the join or
           cap style, the bounding box of a wide line with endpoints
           [x1, y1], [x2, y2], and width w is a rectangle with vertices
           at the following real coordinates:

           [x1-(w*sn/2), y1+(w*cs/2)], [x1+(w*sn/2), y1-(w*cs/2)],
           [x2-(w*sn/2), y2+(w*cs/2)], [x2+(w*sn/2), y2-(w*cs/2)]

           where sn is the sine of the angle of the line and cs is the
           cosine of the angle of the line.  A pixel is part of the line
           (and hence drawn) if the center of the pixel is fully inside
           the bounding box (which is viewed as having infinitely thin
           edges).  If the center of the pixel is exactly on the
           bounding box, it is part of the line if and only if the
           interior is immediately to its right (x increasing
           direction).  Pixels with centers on a horizontal edge are a
           special case and are part of the line if and only if the
           interior is immediately below (y increasing direction).
           Note that this description is a mathematical model
           describing the pixels that are drawn for a wide line and
           does not imply that trigonometry is required to implement
           such a model.  Real or fixed point arithmetic is
           recommended for computing the corners of the line endpoints
           for lines greater than one pixel in width.

           Thin lines (zero line-width) are "one pixel wide" lines drawn
           using an unspecified, device dependent algorithm (for
           example, Bresenham). There are only two constraints on this
           algorithm. First, if a line is drawn unclipped from [x1,y1]
           to [x2,y2] and another line is drawn unclipped from [x1+dx,
           y1+dy] to [x2+dx,y2+dy], then a point [x,y] is touched by
           drawing the first line if and only if the point [x+dx,y+dy]
           is touched by drawing the second line.  Second, the effective
           set of points comprising a line cannot be affected by
           clipping; that is, a point is touched in a clipped line if
           and only if the point lies inside the clipping region and
           the point would be touched by the line when drawn unclipped.

           Note that a wide line drawn from [x1,y1] to [x2,y2] always
           draws the same pixels as a wide line drawn from [x2,y2] to
           [x1,y1], not counting cap and join styles, but this property
           is not guaranteed for thin lines.  Also note that "jags" in
           adjacent wide lines will always line up properly, but this
           property is not guaranteed for thin lines.  A line-width of
           zero differs from a line-width of one in which pixels are
           drawn.  In general, drawing a thin line will be faster than
           drawing a wide line of width one, but thin lines may not mix
           well aesthetically desirable to obtain precise and uniform
           results across all displays, a client should always use a
           line-width of one, rather than a line-width of zero.

           The line-style defines which segments of a line are drawn:
               Solid:  the full path of the line is drawn
               DoubleDash: the full path of the line is drawn, but the
                           segments defined by the even dashes are
                           filled differently than the segments defined
                           by the odd dashes (see fill-style)
               OnOffDash: only the segments defined by the even dashes
                          are drawn, and cap-style applies to each

                          as Butt for internal caps)

           The cap-style defines how the endpoints of a path are drawn:
               NotLast: equivalent to Butt, except that for a
                        line-width of zero or one the final endpoint is
                        not drawn
               Butt: square at the endpoint, with no projection beyond
               Round: a circular arc with diameter equal to the
                      line-width, centered on the endpoint; equivalent
                      to Butt for line-width zero or one
               Projecting: square at the end, but the path continues
                           beyond the endpoint for a distance equal to
                           half the line-width; equivalent to Butt for
                           line-width zero or one

           The join-style defines how corners are drawn for wide lines:
               Miter: the outer edges of the two lines extend to meet at
                      an angle
               Round: a circular arc with diameter equal to the
                      line-width, centered on the joinpoint
               Bevel: Butt endpoint styles, and then the triangular
                      "notch" filled

           The tile/stipple and clip origins are interpreted relative to
           the origin of whatever destination drawable is specified in a
           graphics request.

           The tile pixmap must have the same root and depth as the
           gcontext (else a Match error).  The stipple pixmap must have
           depth one, and must have the same root as the gcontext (else
           a Match error).  For stipple operations, the stipple pattern
           is tiled in a  single plane, and acts as an additional clip
           mask to be ANDed with the clip-mask.  Any size pixmap can be
           used for tiling or stippling, although some sizes may be
           faster to use than others.

           The fill-style defines the contents of the source for line,
           text, and fill requests.  For all text and fill requests
           (PolyText8, PolyText16, PolyFillRectangle, FillPoly,
           PolyFillArc), for line  requests (PolyLine, PolySegment,
           PolyRectangle, PolyArc) with line-style Solid, and for the
           even dashes for line requests with line-style OnOffDash or
           DoubleDash:
               Solid: foreground
               Tiled: tile
               OpaqueStippled: a tile with the same width and height as
                               stipple, but with background everywhere
                               stipple has a zero and with foreground
                               everywhere stipple has a one

           For the odd dashes for line requests with line-style
           DoubleDash:

               OpaqueStippled: same as for even dashes
               Stippled: background masked by stipple

           The dash-list value allowed here is actually a simplified
           form of the more general patterns that can be set with
           SetDashes.Specifying a value of N here is equivalent to
           specifying the two element list [N, N] in SetDashes.  The
           value must be non-zero.  The meaning of dash-offset and
           dash-list are explained in the SetDashes request.

           The clip-mask restricts writes to the destination drawable;
           only pixels where the clip-mask has a one bit are drawn.  It
           affects all graphics requests.  The clip-mask does not clip
           sources.  The clip-mask origin is interpreted relative to the
           origin of whatever destination drawable is specified in a
           graphics request.  If a pixmap is specified as the clip-mask,
           it must have depth one and have the same root as the gcontext
           (else a Match error).  The clip-mask can also be set with the
           SetClipRectangles request.

           For ClipByChildren, both source and destination windows are
           additionally clipped by all viewable InputOutput children.
           For IncludeInferiors, neither source nor destination window
           is clipped by inferiors; this will result in drawing through
           subwindow boundaries. The use of IncludeInferiors on a window
           of one depth with mapped inferiors of differing depth is not
           illegal, but the semantics isundefined by the core protocol.

           The fill-rule defines what pixels are inside (i.e., are
           drawn) for paths given in FillPoly requests.  EvenOdd means
           a point is inside if an infinite ray with the point as origin
           crosses the path an odd number of times.  For Winding, a
           point is inside if an infinite ray with the point as origin
           crosses an unequal number of clockwise and counterclockwise
           directed path segments.  For both rules, a "point" is
           infinitely small, and the path is an infinitely thin line.
           A pixel is inside if the center point of the pixel is inside
           and the center point is not on the boundary.  If the center
           point is on the boundary, the pixel is inside if and only if
           the polygon interior is immediately to its right (x
           increasing direction).  Pixels with centers along a
           horizontal edge are a special case and are inside if and
           only if the polygon interior is immediately below (y
           increasing direction).

           The arc-mode controls filling in the PolyFillArc request.

           Storing a pixmap in a gcontext might or might not result in a
           copy being made.  If the pixmap is later used as the
           destination for a graphics request, the change might or might

           simultaneously  in a graphics request as both a destination
           and as a tile or stipple. the results are not defined.

           It is quite likely that some amount of gcontext information
           will be cached in display hardware, and that such hardware
           can only cache a small number of gcontexts.  Given the number
           and complexity of components, clients should view switching
           between gcontexts with nearly identical state as

           Changes clip-mask in gc to the specified list of rectangles
           and sets the clip origin.  Output will be clipped to remain
           contained within the rectangles.  The clip origin is
           interpreted relative to the origin of whatever destination
           drawable is specified in a graphics request.  The rectangle
           coordinates are interpreted relative to the clip origin.
           The rectangles should be non-intersecting, or graphics
           results will be undefined.

           If known by the client, ordering relations on the rectangles
           can be specified with the ordering argument; this may provide
           faster operation by the server.  If an incorrect ordering is
           specified, the server may generate a Match error, but is not
           required to do so; if no error is generated, the graphics
           results are undefined. UnSorted means the rectangles are in
           arbitrary order.  YSorted means that the rectangles are
           non-decreasing in their Y origin. YXSorted additionally
           constrains YSorted order in that all rectangles with an equal
           Y origin are non-decreasing in their X origin.  YXBanded
           additionally constrains YXSorted by requiring that for every
           possible Y scanline, all rectangles that include that
           scanline have identical Y origins and Y extents.

           Draws circular or elliptical arcs.  Each arc is specified by

           relative to the origin of the drawable, and define the upper
           left corner of the rectangle.  The center of the circle or
           ellipse is the center of the rectangle, and the major and
           minor axes are specified by the width and height,
           respectively.  The angles are signed integers in degrees
           scaled by 64, with positive indicating counterclockwise
           motion and negative indicating clockwise motion.  The start
           of the arc is specified by angle1 relative to the
           three-oclock position from the center, and the path and
           extent of the arc is specified by angle2 relative to the
           start of the arc.  If the magnitude of angle2 is greater
           than 360 degrees, it is truncated to 360 degrees.

           The arcs are drawn in the order listed.  If the last point in
           one arc coincides with the first point in the following arc,
           the two arcs will join correctly.  If the first point in the
           first arc coincides with the last point in the last arc, the
           two arcs will join correctly.  For any given arc, no pixel is

           draws the same pixels as specifying the other endpoint and an

           undefined. In the colormap there are only C*(2^R)
           independent red entries, C*(2^G) independent green entries,
           and C*(2^B) independent blue entries.  This is true even for
           PseudoColor.  When the colormap entry for a pixel value is
           changed using StoreColors or StoreNamedColor, the pixel is
           decomposed according to the masks and the corresponding
           independent entries are updated.

           Errors: Colormap, Access, Value

           The plane-mask should not have any bits in common with any of
           the pixels.  The set of all pixels is produced by ORing
           together subsets of plane-mask with the pixels.  The request
           frees all of these pixels. Note that freeing an individual
           pixel obtained from AllocColorPlanes may not actually allow
           it to be reused until all of its "related" pixels are also
           freed.

           All specified pixels that are allocated by the client in
           cmap are freed, even if one or more pixels produce an error.
           A Value error is generated if a specified pixel is not a
           valid index into cmap, and an Access error is generated if a
           specified pixel is not allocated by the client (i.e., is
           unallocated or is only allocated by another client). If more
           than one pixel is in error, which one is reported is

           components should actually be changed.  If the colormap is an
           installed  map for its screen, the changes are visible
           immediately.

           All specified pixels that are allocated writable in cmap (by
           any client) are changed, even if one or more pixels produce
           an error.  A Value error is generated if a specified pixel is
           not a valid index into cmap, and an Access error is generated
           if a specified pixel is unallocated or is allocated
           read-only.  If more than one pixel is in error, which one is

           must have depth one (else a Match error), but can have any
           root.  The mask pixmap defines the shape of the cursor; that
           is, the one bits in the mask define which source pixels will
           be displayed.  If no mask is given, all pixels of the source
           are displayed.  The mask, if present, must be the same size
           as source (else a Match error).  The x and y coordinates

           Sets the mapping of the keyboard.  Elements of the list are
           indexed starting from one.  The list must be of length 255.
           The index is a "core" keycode, and the element of the list
           defines the "effective" keycode.

           A zero element disables a key, no elements can have values 1
           through 7, and no two elements (with index larger than 7) can
           have the same non-zero value.  If the keyboard does not
           really generate a given keycode, specifying a non-zero value
           for that core keycode has no effect.

           Elements 6 and 7 of the map must always be zero.  The first
           five elements are special:  they specify the keycodes (if
           any) that correspond to the Mod1 through Mod5 modifiers.
           Setting one of these entries to zero disables use of that
           modifier bit.  No two of the firstfive elements can have the
           same non-zero value.

           A server can impose restrictions on how keyboards get
           remapped, e.g., if certain keys do not generate up
           transitions in hardware.

           If any of the keys or modifiers to be altered are currently
           in the down state, the status reply is Busy and the mapping
           is not changed.

           only auto-repeat-mode is specified, then the global
           auto-repeat mode for the entire keyboard is changed, if

           A bell generator connected with the console but not directly

           Sets the mapping of the pointer.  Elements of the list are
           indexed starting from one.  The length of the list must be
           the same as GetPointerMapping would return.  The index is a
           "core" button number, and the element of the list defines
           the "effective" number.

           A zero element disables a button, and elements are not
           restricted in   value by the number of physical buttons, but
           no two elements can have the same non-zero value.

           If any of the buttons to be altered are currently in the
           down state,the status reply is Busy and the mapping is not

           Returns the current mapping of the pointer.  Elements of the
           list are indexed starting from one.  The length of the list
           indicates the number of physical buttons.

           The nominal mapping for a pointer is the identity mapping;

           Defines how the pointer moves.  The acceleration is a
           multiplier for movement, expressed as a fraction.  For
           example, specifying 3/1 means the pointer moves three times
           as fast as normal. The fraction may be rounded arbitrarily
           by the server.  Acceleration only takes effect if the
           pointer moves more than threshold pixels at once, and only
           applies to the amount beyond the threshold.  Setting a
           value to -1 restores the default. Other negative values

           Timeout and interval are specified in minutes; setting a
           value to -1 restores the default.  Other negative values
           generate a Value error. If the timeout value is zero,
           screen-saver is disabled.  If the timeout value is
           non-zero, screen-saver is enabled.  Once screen-saver
           is enabled, if no input from the keyboard or pointer is
           generated for timeout minutes, screen-saver is activated.
           For each screen, if blanking is preferred and the hardware
           supports video blanking, the screen will simply go blank.
           Otherwise, if either exposures are allowed or the screen
           can be regenerated without sending exposure events to
           clients, the screen is tiled with the root window
           background tile, randomly re-origined each interval
           minutes if the interval value is non-zero.  Otherwise, the
           state of the screen does not change and screen-saver is not
           activated.  Screen-saver is deactivated, and all screen
           states are restored, at the next keyboard or pointer input

           Adds or removes the specified host from the access control
           list.  When the access control mechanism is enabled and a
           host attempts to establish a connection to the server, the
           host must be in this list or the server will refuse the
           connection.

           The client must reside on the same host as the server, and/or
           have been granted permission in the initial authorization at
           connection setup.

           An initial access control list can be specified, typically
           by naming a file that the server reads at startup and reset.

           If a valid resource is specified, forces a close-down of the

           terminated in either RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary mode,
           all of the client's resources are destroyed (see <a href="#section-11">Section 11</a>).
           If AllTemporary is specified, then the resources of all
           clients that have terminated in RetainTemporary are
           destroyed.

NoOperation
           This request has no arguments and no results, but the request
           length field can be non-zero, allowing the request to be any
           multiple of 4 bytes in length.  The bytes contained in the
           request are uninterpreted by the server.

           This request can be used in its minimum 4 byte form as
           "padding" where necessary by client libraries that find it
           convenient to force requests to begin on 64-bit boundaries.


<a href="#section-11">SECTION 11</a>.  CONNECTION CLOSE

What happens at connection close:

           All event selections made by the client are discarded.  If
           the client has the pointer actively grabbed, an
           UngrabPointer is performed.  If the client has the keyboard
           actively grabbed,  an UngrabKeyboard is performed.  All
           passive grabs by the client are eleased.  If the client has
           the server grabbed, and UngrabServer is performed.  If
           close-down mode (see ChangeCloseDownMode) is
           RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary, then all resources
           (including colormap entries)    allocated by the client are
           marked as "permanent" or "temporary", respectively (but
           this does not prevent other clients from explicitly
           destroying them).  If the mode is Destroy, then all of the
           client's resources are destroyed as described below.

What happens when a client's resources are destroyed:

           created by the client, that save-set window is reparented to
           the closest ancestor such that the save-set window is not an
           inferior of a window created by the client.  If the save-set
           window is unmaped, a MapWindow request is performed on it.
           After save-set processing, all windows created by the client
           are destroyed.  For each non-window resource created by the
           client, the appropriate Free request is performed.  All
           colors and colormap entries allocated by the client are
           freed.

What happens when the last connection to a server closes:

           A server goes through a cycle, of having no connections and
           having some connections.  At every transition to the state
           of having no connections, the server "resets" its state, as
           if it had just been started.  This starts by destroying all
           lingering resources from clients that have terminated in
           RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary mode.  It additionally
           includes deleting all but the predefined atom identifiers,
           deleting all properties on all root windows, resetting all
           device maps and attributes (key click, bell volume,
           acceleration), resetting the access control list, restoring
           the standard root tiles and cursors, restoring the default
           font path, and restoring the input focus to state
           PointerRoot.

<a href="#section-12">SECTION 12</a>.  EVENTS

      When a button is pressed with the pointer in some window W, and
      no active pointer grab is in progress, then the ancestors if W are
      searched from the root down, looking for a passive grab to
      activate.  If no matching passive grab on the button exists, then
      an active grab is started automatically for the client receiving
      the event, and the last-pointer-grab time is set to the current
      server time. The effect is essentially equivalent to a GrabButton
      with arguments:
           event-window: the event window
           event-mask: the client's selected events on the event window
           pointer-mode and keyboard-mode: Asynchronous
           owner-events: True if the client has OwnerGrabButton selected
                   on the event window, else False
           confine-to: None
           cursor: None
   The grab is terminated automatically when all buttons are released.
   UngrabPointer and ChangeActiveGrab can both be used to modify the
   active grab.

           time: TIMESTAMP

           Generated when a key or button changes state, or the pointer
           moves. The "source" of the event is the window the pointer
           is in.  The window with respect to which the event is
           normally reported is found by looking up the hierarchy
           (starting with  the source window) for the first window on
           which any client has selected interest in the event,
           provided no intervening window prohibits event generation by
           including the event type in its do-not-propagate-mask.  The
           actual window used for reporting can be modified by active
           grabs and the focus window. The window the event is reported
           with respect to is called the "event" window.

           Root is the root window of the "source" window, and root-x
           and root-y are the pointer coordinates relative to root's
           origin at the time of the event.  Event is the "event"
           window.  If the event window is on the same screen as root,
           then event-x and event-y are the pointer coordinates relative
           to the event window's origin; otherwise event-x and event-y
           are zero.  If the source window is an inferior of the event
           window, then child is set to the child of the event window
           that is an ancestor of the source window.  The state
           component gives the state of the buttons and modifier keys
           just before the event.  The detailcomponent varies with
           the event type:
               KeyPress, KeyRelease:               KEYCODE
               ButtonPress, ButtonRelease:         BUTTON
               MotionNotify:                       {Normal, Hint}

           MotionNotify events are only generated when the motion
           begins and ends in the window.  The granularity of motion
           events is not guaranteed, but a client selecting for motion
           events is guaranteed to get at least one event when the
           pointer moves and comes to rest.  Selecting PointerMotion
           receives events independent of the state of the pointer
           buttons.  By selecting some subset of Button[1-5]Motion
           instead, MotionNotify events will only be received when one
           or more of the specified buttons are pressed.  By selecting
           ButtonMotion, MotionNotify events will received only when at

           least one button is pressed.  The events are always of type
           MotionNotify, independent of the selection. If
           PointerMotionHint is selected, the server is free to send
           only one MotionNotify event (with detail Hint) to the client
           for the event window, until either the key or button state
           changes, or the pointer leaves the event window, or the

           focus: BOOL
           state: SETofKEYBUTMASK
           time: TIMESTAMP

           If pointer motion causes the pointer to be in a different
           window than before, EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events are
           generated instead of a  MotionNotify event.  Only clients
           selecting EnterWindow on a window receive EnterNotify events,
           and only clients selection LeaveNotifyreceive LeaveNotify
           events.  The pointer position reported in the event is always
           the "final" position, not the "initial" position of the
           pointer.  In a LeaveNotify event, if a child of the event
           window contains the "initial" position of the pointer, then
           the child component is set to that child, otherwise it is
           None.  For an EnterNotify event, if a child of the event
           window contains the "final" pointer position, then the child
           component is set to that child, otherwise it is None.  If
           the the event window is the focus window or an inferior of
           the focus window, then focus is True, and otherwisefocus is
           False.

           Normal pointer motion events have mode Normal; pseudo-motion
           events when a grab actives have mode Grab, and pseudo-motion
           events when a grab deactivates have mode Ungrab.

       Normal events are generated as follows:

       When the pointer moves from window A to window B, and A is an
       inferior of B:
           LeaveNotify with detail Ancestor is generated on A
           LeaveNotify with detail Virtual is generated on each window

           EnterNotify with detail Nonlinear is generated on B

       When a pointer grab activates (but after any initial warp into a
       confine-to window), with G the grab-window for the grab and P the
       window the pointer is in:
           EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events with mode Grab are
           generated (as for Normal above) as if the pointer were to
           suddenly warp from its current position in P to some position
           in G.However,  the pointer does not warp, and the pointer
           position is used as  both the "initial"and "final" positions
           for the events.

       When a pointer grab deactivates, with G the grab-window for the
       grab and P the window the pointer is in:

           EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events with mode Ungrab are
           generated (as for Normal above) as if the pointer were to
           suddenly warp from from some position in G to its current
           position in P.  However, the pointer does not warp, and the
           current pointer position is used as both the "initial" and
           "final" positions for the events.

           Possibly generated when a region of the window becomes
           viewable, but might only be generated when a region becomes
           visible. All of the regions exposed by a given "action" are
           guaranteed to be reported contiguously; if last-in-series is
           False then another exposure follows.

           The x and y coordinates are relative to drawable's origin,
           and  specify the upper left corner of a rectangule.  The
           width and height specify the extent of the rectangle.

           Expose events are never generated on InputOnly windows.

           Reported to clients selecting VisibilityChange on the
           window.  In the following, the state of the window is
           calculated ignoring all of the window's subwindows.  When
           a window changes state from partially or fully obscured or
           not viewable to viewable and completely unobscured, an
           event with Unobscured  is generated.  When a window changes
           state from a) viewable and completely unobscured or b) not
           viewable, to viewable and partially obscured, an event with
           PartiallyObscured is generated.  When a window changes state
           from a) viewable and completely unobscured or b) viewable and
           partially obscured or c) not viewable, to viewable and fully
           obscured, an event with FullyObscured is generated.

           VisibilityNotify events are never generated on InputOnly

           time: TIMESTAMP

           Reported to clients selecting PropertyChange on the window.
           Generated when a property of the window is changed.  The
           timestamp indicates the server time when the property was
           changed.

           selection: ATOM
           time: TIMESTAMP

           Reported to the current owner of a selection.  Generated on
           the window losing ownership when a new owner is being
           defined.  The timestamp is the last-change time recorded for
           the selection.

           property: ATOM or None
           requestor: WINDOW
           time: TIMESTAMP or CurrentTime

           Reported to the owner of a selection.  Generated when a
           client issues a ConvertSelection request. The arguments are
           as in the request.

           The owner should convert the selection based on the specified
           target type.  If a property is specified, the owner should
           store the result as that property on the requestor window,
           and then send a SelectionNotify event to the requestor using
           SendEvent.  If the selection cannot be converted as
           requested, the owner should send a SelectionNotify with the
           property set to None.

           selection, target: ATOM
           property: ATOM or None
           time: TIMESTAMP or CurrentTime

           This event is only generated by clients using SendEvent.  The
           owner of a selection should send this event to a requestor
           when a selection has been converted and stored as a property,
           or when a selection conversion could not be performed
           (indicated with property None).

ColormapNotify

           colormap: COLORMAP or None
           new: BOOL
           state: {Installed, Uninstalled}

           Reported to clients selecting ColormapChange on the window.
           Generated with value True for new when the colormap attribute
           of the window is changed.  Generated with value False for new
           when the colormap of a window is installed or uninstalled. In
           either case, state indicates whether the colormap is
           currently installed.

           receiving client; the server places no interpretation on the
           type or the data.  The format specifies whether the data
           should be viewed as a list of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit
           quantities, so that the server can correctly byte-swap as
           necessary. The data always consists of either 20 8-bit values
           or 10 16-bit values or 5 32-bit values, although particular
           message types might not make use of all of these values.

<a href="#section-13">SECTION 13</a>.  FLOW CONTROL AND CONCURRENCY

    Whenever the server is writing to a given connection, it is
    permissible for the server to stop reading from that connection (but
    if the writing would block it must continue to service other
    connections).  The server is not required to buffer more than a
    single request per connection at one time.  For a given connection
    to the server, a client can block while reading from the connection,
    but should undertake to read (events and errors) when writing would
    block. Failure on the part of a client to obey this rule could
    result in a deadlocked connection, although deadlock is probably
    unlikely unless the transport layer has very little buffering, or
    unless the client attempts to send large numbers of requests without
    ever reading replies or checking for errors and events.

    If a server is implemented with internal concurrency, the overall
    effect must be as if individual requests are executed to completion
    in some serial order, and that requests from a given connection are
    executed in delivery order (i.e., the total execution order is a
    shuffle of the individual streams).  The "execution" of a request
    includes validating all arguments, collecting all data for any
    reply, and generating (and queueing) all required events, but does
    not include the actual transmission of the reply and the events.
    In addition, the   effect of any other "cause" (e.g., activation of
    a grab, pointer motion) that can generate multiple events must
    effectively generate (and queue) all required events indivisibly
    with respect to all other causes and requests.
