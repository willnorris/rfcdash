Abstract

   This document describes extending the IETF Datatracker to capture and
   display the progression of Internet-Drafts that are intended to be
   published as RFCs by the IAB, IRTF, or Independent Submissions
   Editor.  The states and annotations that are to be added to the
   Datatracker will be applied to Internet-Drafts as soon as any of
   these streams identify the Internet-Draft as a potential eventual
   RFC, and will continue through the lifetime of the Internet-Draft.
   The goal of adding this information to the Datatracker is to give the
   whole Internet community more information about the status of these
   Internet-Drafts and the streams from which they originate.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" name="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   As described in <a href="rfc4844.html#section-5">Section 5 of [RFC4844]</a>, there are currently four
   streams that feed into the RFC publication process: the IETF document
   stream, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) document stream, the
   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) document stream, and the
   Independent Submissions stream that is administered by the
   Independent Submissions Editor (ISE).  Each of these streams consist
   of Internet-Drafts (often abbreviated "I-Ds") that have been
   identified by an organization or role as being part of their stream.
   Each stream maintainer progresses documents towards RFC publication
   in its own fashion.  A document can only be in one stream at a time.

   In recent years, there has been a desire by IETF participants and
   others to see more of the process used by each stream.  For example,
   some people want to know how close the IAB is to finishing a
   particular document; IETF participants might want to know the
   progress of IRTF research documents that are in areas related to
   their engineering work; people who have asked for the ISE to publish

   their document want to track its progress.  If the IETF Datatracker
   ("tracker") has more information about each stream's states, this
   information is much more easily accessible.

   In this document, the term "IETF Datatracker" is used as a generic
   name for the existing tool used to track state changes as Internet-
   Drafts are processed.  The word "IETF" in the name "IETF Datatracker"
   is not meant to limit use of the tool to the IETF document stream;
   this document expands use of the tool to the other streams described
   in <a href="rfc4844.html">RFC 4844</a>.

   This document describes the additional tracker states that are
   specific to each of the IAB, the IRTF, and the ISE document flows.  A
   document might also have one or more annotations assigned as well.
   Because each stream is controlled by a different organization, this
   document separates out the proposed states and annotations for each
   stream, and associates specific semantics stream-by-stream.

   Annotations may be applied at any time to a document that is intended
   for the particular stream.  A document may have more than one
   annotation applied to it.  It is likely that the comments for these
   annotations will supply valuable information about the annotation.
   Each stream owner needs to have write access to the states and
   annotations for all the documents in their stream.  They should also
   be able to assign others to have the same write privileges.

   This document does not describe which person in each stream might be
   able to edit these states and annotations; it is assumed that this is
   a simple enough task that it can be negotiated between each stream
   administrator and the tracker administrator.  Also, this document
   assumes that whoever is making the edits to the state and annotations
   can enter comments that will be publicly visible.

   Some streams have comments that are very long, such as document
   reviews and document poll results.  The tracker needs to be able to
   store long annotation comments.

   Note that this document does not discuss documents in the IETF
   stream.  The states and permissions for IETF stream documents that
   have been requested for publication are already implemented in the
   tracker.  A separate set of documents, [<a href="rfc6174.html" title='"Definition of IETF Working Group Document States"'>RFC6174</a>] and [<a href="rfc6175.html" title='"Requirements to Extend the Datatracker for IETF Working Group Chairs and Authors"'>RFC6175</a>],
   describe the tracker states and associated permissions proposed for
   documents in the IETF stream that have been adopted, or are being
   considered for adoption, by IETF Working Groups.

   The intent of this document is to inform an initial development
   effort for the tool described here.  It is not intended to stand as
   the requirements against the tool once it is deployed.  That is,

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc6322.html">RFC 6322</a>        Datatracker States for Alternate Streams       July 2011</span>


   there is no current intention to update this document frequently as
   the tool evolves and small features are added and changed.

   This document defines three state machines that fit into the IETF
   Datatracker.  The Datatracker will have multiple state machines.
   This document was prepared in coordination with the IAB, IRTF, and
   ISE, at the request of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee
   (IAOC).

   o  Candidate IAB Document -- A document being considered for the IAB
      stream.

   o  Active IAB Document -- This document has been adopted by the IAB
      and is being actively developed.

   o  Parked IAB Document -- This document has lost its author or
      editor, is waiting for another document to be written, or cannot
      currently be worked on by the IAB for some other reason.
      Annotations probably explain why this document is parked.

   o  IAB Review -- This document is awaiting the IAB itself to come to
      internal consensus.

   o  Community Review -- This document has completed internal consensus
      within the IAB and is now under community review.  (The IAB
      normally allows community input during earlier stages of the
      process as well.)

   o  Approved by IAB, To Be Sent to RFC Editor -- The consideration of
      this document is complete, but it has not yet been sent to the RFC
      Editor for publication (although that is going to happen soon).

   o  Sent to a Different Organization for Publication -- The IAB does
      not expect to publish the document itself, but has passed it on to
      a different organization that might continue work on the document.
      The expectation is that the other organization will eventually
      publish the document.

   o  Sent to the RFC Editor -- The IAB processing of this document is
      complete and it has been sent to the RFC Editor for publication.
      The document may be in the RFC Editor's queue, or it may have been
      published as an RFC; this state doesn't distinguish between
      different states occurring after the document has left the IAB.

   o  Dead IAB Document -- This document was an active IAB document, but
      for some reason it is no longer being pursued for the IAB stream.
      It is possible that the document might be revived later, possibly
      in another stream.

   o  Editor Needed -- The document has lost its editor but it is still
      intended to be part of the IAB stream.

   o  Waiting for Dependency on Other Document -- Activity on this
      document is expected to be low or non-existent while waiting for
      another document (probably listed in the comments) to progress.

   o  Waiting for Partner Feedback -- The IAB often produces documents
      that need to be socialized with outside organizations (such as the
      IEEE) or other internal organizations (such as the IESG or the
      IAOC).  This document has been sent out for feedback from one of
      these partner groups.

   o  Awaiting Reviews -- Activity on this document is expected to be
      low or non-existent while waiting for reviews that were solicited
      by the IAB.

   o  Revised I-D Needed -- Comments that will cause changes have been
      submitted, and no processing is expected until a new draft is
      issued.

   o  Document Shepherd Followup -- The document's shepherd is expected
      to take some action before the document can proceed.

   Some IAB members, and members of the IAB Executive Directorate, need
   to be able to set the states and annotations for IAB documents during
   their life cycle.  The IAB Chair needs to be able to grant access to
   individuals to modify the state and annotations; such access applies
   to all IAB Stream documents.

   This section describes the desired states and annotations for the
   IRTF stream.  Some of the steps take place in IRTF Research Groups
   (RGs), while others take place in the Internet Research Steering
   Group (IRSG).

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.1.%20%20States%20for%20the%20IRTF%20Stream"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3.1" name="section-3.1">3.1</a>.  States for the IRTF Stream</span>

   o  Candidate RG Document -- This document is under consideration in
      an RG for becoming an IRTF document.  A document in this state
      does not imply any RG consensus and does not imply any precedence
      or selection.  It's simply a way to indicate that somebody has
      asked for a document to be considered for adoption by an RG.

   o  Active RG Document -- This document has been adopted by an RG and
      is being actively developed.

   o  Parked RG Document -- This document has lost its author or editor,
      is waiting for another document to be written, or cannot currently
      be worked on by the RG that adopted it for some other reason.

   o  In RG Last Call -- The document is in its final review in the RG.

   o  Waiting for Document Shepherd -- IRTF documents have document
      shepherds who help RG documents through the process after the RG
      has finished with the document.

   o  Waiting for IRTF Chair -- The IRTF Chair is meant to be performing
      some task such as sending a request for IESG Review.

   o  Awaiting IRSG Reviews -- The document shepherd has taken the
      document to the IRSG and solicited reviews from one or more IRSG
      members.

   o  In IRSG Poll -- The IRSG is taking a poll on whether or not the
      document is ready to be published.

   o  In IESG Review -- The IRSG has asked the IESG to do a review of
      the document, as described in [<a href="rfc5742.html" title='"IESG Procedures for Handling of Independent and IRTF Stream Submissions"'>RFC5742</a>].

   o  Sent to the RFC Editor -- The document has been submitted for
      publication (and not returned to the IRTF for further action).
      The document may be in the RFC Editor's queue, or it may have been
      published as an RFC; this state doesn't distinguish between
      different states occurring after the document has left the IRTF.

      that the document be held pending further review, as specified in
      <a href="rfc5742.html">RFC 5742</a>, and the IRTF has agreed to such a hold.

   o  Editor Needed -- The document has lost its editor but it still
      intended to be the output of an RG.

   o  Shepherd Needed -- The document needs a shepherd assigned to it.

   o  Waiting for Dependency on Other Document -- Activity on this
      document is expected to be low or non-existent while waiting for
      another document (probably listed in the comments) to progress.

   o  Revised I-D Needed -- Discussion has ensued that is expected to
      cause changes, and no progress is expected until a new draft is
      issued.

   o  IESG Review Completed -- The IESG has completed its review on the
      document, as described in [<a href="rfc5742.html" title='"IESG Procedures for Handling of Independent and IRTF Stream Submissions"'>RFC5742</a>].

   An RG Chair needs to be able to set the states and annotations for an
   IRTF document before the RG has sent the document to the IRSG for
   review.  The RG Chair also needs to be able to give the same ability
   to a shepherd that is assigned by the RG chair.  This access control
   is similar to the access control that is specified in [<a href="rfc6175.html" title='"Requirements to Extend the Datatracker for IETF Working Group Chairs and Authors"'>RFC6175</a>] for
   IETF WG chairs and their document shepherds.

   The RG chairs should be able to modify the state and annotations for
   any of that RG's documents at any time.  The IRTF Chair should be
   able to modify the state and annotations for any IRTF Stream document
   at any time.

   RG chairs and document shepherds may change at any point in a
   document's life cycle.  The Datatracker must allow for and log these
   changes.

   This section describes the desired states and annotations for the
   Independent Submission stream.  The ISE will do his or her own
   record-keeping for data not related to states and annotations.

   Many documents in the Independent Submission stream come from the
   other three streams.  Because of this, the tracker needs to preserve
   previous states and annotations on drafts that come to the
   Independent Submission stream.

   When the Datatracker displays the metadata for an individual draft in
   the IAB stream, IRTF stream, or ISE stream, it should show at least
   the following information:

   Document stream:           IAB / IRTF / Independent Submission
   I-D availability status:   Active / Expired / Withdrawn / RFC
                                Replaces / Replaced I-D or RFC

   Internet-Drafts sometimes move between streams.  For example, a draft
   might start out in the IETF stream but then move to the Independent
   Submission stream, or a draft might move from an IRTF RG to the IETF
   stream.  Thus, the IETF Datatracker needs to be able to change the
   designated stream of a draft.  It is expected that this will be done
   by the stream managers.  In addition, the IETF Datatracker should
   preserve all data from the earlier stream(s) when a document moves
   between streams.

   Internet-Drafts sometimes move out of a stream into a non-stream
   state.  For example, a draft that is in the "Candidate IAB Document",
   "Candidate RG Document", or "Submission Received" state might not be
   adopted by the stream and revert back to having no stream-specific
   state.  The IETF Datatracker needs to be able to handle the
   transition from having a stream-related state to a null state.

   New streams may be added in the future, and the tool needs to be able
   to handle additional streams.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/7.%20%20IESG%20Mail%20Sent%20for%20the%20IRTF%20and%20Independent%20Stream"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-7" name="section-7">7</a>.  IESG Mail Sent for the IRTF and Independent Stream</span>

   After the IESG performs a review of potential RFCs from the IRTF and
   Independent streams, as described in <a href="rfc5742.html">RFC 5742</a>, the IETF Datatracker
   sends out email to the IANA, the IESG, ietf-announce@ietf.org, and
   the stream manager with the results of the IESG's review.  In the
   past, the subject line and body of that message has been misleading
   about the scope and purpose of the message.  There is now a
   requirement that the message clearly state that the message is about
   the IETF-conflict review of a particular Internet-Draft.

   Note that these letters have effects on the state machine for the
   IESG, although those effects are not covered in this document.

   of the Internet in any significant fashion.
