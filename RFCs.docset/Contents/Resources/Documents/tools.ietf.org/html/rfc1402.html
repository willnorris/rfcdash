Abstract

   A wealth of information exists on the network.  In fact, there is so
   much information that you could spend your entire life browsing. This
   paper will present some of the "gold nuggets" of information and file
   repositories on the network that could be useful.

   The ultimate goal is to make the route to these sources of
   information invisible to you.  At present, this is not easy to do.  I
   will explain some of the techniques that can be used to make these
   nuggets easier to pick up so that we all can be richer.

<span class="h3"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/1.0%20%20Introduction"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.0" name="section-1.0">1.0</a>  Introduction</span>

   This paper is a list of the essential things, in my view, that a
   people who are responsible for providing network information should
   have in their hands as reference material.  One of the basic problems
   with information is making it easily available to those who need the
   data.  Libraries have been performing a cataloging function for many
   centuries.  Information flow is now being provided so fast that it is
   difficult to keep up with it, even partially. Computer networks have
   only added to the problem by opening up access to even more
   information.

   Attempting to make this wealth of information available to those who
   would find it useful poses some problems.

   First, we need to know of its existence.  To that end, this paper
   provides an index to the vast realm of network information. Most of
   the documents listed here are POINTERS to the final information.

   Second, even if you know of a document's existence, you may not know
   if it is important or relevant.  Few of us are knowledgeable in more
   than a limited area.  We need to rely on others to make us aware of
   the importance of databases in a specific discipline. Librarians can
   be of great assistance here.  They are familiar with the research
   databases that individuals search in law, mathematics, and many other
   fields.

   Finally, once existence and importance are known, the information
   needs to be indexed so that researchers can find it.  This is the
   most difficult task to accomplish.  Information available on the
   network is rarely static.  It is always moving, growing, changing,
   and dying.  Computers should be able to assist us in managing this
   ever-changing environment.  Right now, we have to catalog the
   information as it passes through the network.  In my  case, I
   generally save it in a file somewhere and spend far too much time
   trying to retrieve it again when I need it.

   A frequently asked question concerns how the average mortal gets
   access to the Internet.  The most common way is via electronic mail.
   Using e-mail, it is possible to communicate with anyone on the
   Internet and on any other networks as well, and there are many
   "gateways" to the Internet from other networks and systems.  For
   instance using CompuServe, a large commercial electronic information
   and communication service, you can send e-mail to and from
   individuals on the Internet.

   A direct connection to the Internet provides some additional
   capabilities that e-mail cannot.  One of these is the ability to
   establish a connection to a remote computer connected to the Internet
   from your own personal computer or from one connected to the
   Internet. The program that establishes this connection is called
   Telnet.  Many universities and large research companies have Internet
   connections.  They pay rather large fees to have these high speed
   (more than one million bits per second) connections.  If you are
   associated with a large university or company you already may have
   access or can gain access to the Internet using one of their
   computers.

   A direct connection to the Internet also allows you to transfer a
   file from a remote computer.  This program is referred to as FTP
   (file transfer protocol).  <a href="#section-4.0">Section 4.0</a> covers the many places that
   have files and programs available using FTP.

   The following information was taken from a Frequently Asked Question
   posting by Aydin Edguer to the alt.bbs newsgroup.

   If you do not have access to a service connected to Internet, you can
   get access for a fee.  The following companies provide Internet
   access to individuals or companies at various rates depending on the
   time of access, speed of access desired, and several other factors.

   The first method to gain access to the Internet is by getting an
   account on a public access bulletin board system that is connected to
   the Internet.  There are a growing number of such systems available.
   For information on some of these systems, send electronic mail to:

        info@world.std.com
        info@netcom.com
        info@concert.net
        info@panix.com
        info@holonet.net
        info@msen.com
        info@csn.org
        sysadmin@ids.com

   Any of these systems is open to the public for a monthly access fee.

   A second method to gain access to the Internet is by getting an
   account with a network service provider who offers a dial-in service.
   See the "How do I get connected to the Internet?" section for more
   information.

   How do I get connected to the Internet?

   Traditionally, connections to the Internet were dedicated
   connections.  This is still the most common type of connection.
   Monthly costs for the connection range anywhere from $250 per month
   [plus line charges] for a dialup 9600-bps connection to $4,000 [plus
   line charges] for a T1 [1.44-Mbps] connection.  There is also an
   initial one-time startup fee of anywhere from $100 to $8,000 [plus
   equipment charges].

   Some service providers also are offering part-time dialup
   connections.  Customers share a set of phone lines and dialup when
   needed.  This is usually less expensive than dedicated dialup
   connections for customers who need a connection less than 80 hours
   per month.  Monthly costs range from $40-100 per month [plus line
   charges] plus an hourly charge of $2-4.

   Some service providers have begun to offer a new dial-in service.
   The name for dial-in service varies from vendor to vendor.  The
   dial-in service is usually provided as a way for Internet-connected
   users to connect back to their home sites from remote locations.  But
   most service providers do not limit their service to this audience,
   it is open to people not already on the Internet.  The dial-in
   service provides either a terminal server connection [with password]
   or an account on the service provider's equipment [with password]
   which permits you to use Telnet to connect to other sites on the
   Internet.  This service differs from the normal dialup IP services
   because it does not require the user to run any IP software like PPP
   (Point-to-Point protocol) or SLIP (serial line IP).  The cost for
   this service usually range from $35 to $250 per month [plus line
   charges].  There is also an initial $35 to $500 connection fee [plus
   equipment charges].

   The following is a list of known Internet service providers, along
   with the services they offer, an e-mail address to contact for more
   information, a phone number to contact for more information, or an
   FTP archive for more information.

   Please note, although this is a Frequently asked Question, this
   newsgroup, alt.bbs.internet, is NOT for the discussion of how to get
   connected to the Internet.  This is the correct newsgroup to discuss
   your bulletin board system and what it offers once you are connected
   to the Internet.

   The above excerpt is from a frequently asked questions Usenet posting
   to alt.bbs.internet and crossposted to news.answers.  The
   news.answers newsgroup is a very good group to subscribe to read the
   frequently asked questions sent to many newsgroups.  See 12.6 Usenet
   entry in the Glossary for more information on newsgroups.

   Further investigation in the above groups yields a great deal of
   information about techniques and rates to access the Internet.  Of
   course one common question is about getting free access.  As
   mentioned before if you are associated with a university, a large
   company, or research group you may very well have access via one of
   their computers.  If you are a student or faculty member and are away
   from your local campus, you may be able to get a guest account from
   the local university.

   Some campuswide information systems may give limited access to the
   network in a read-only mode.  Also some communities (such as
   Cleveland) operate a FREENET which enables you to read newsgroups and
   if you register send mail at no charge.  See <a href="#section-8.0">section 8.0</a> for more
   information.

   For example, you can Telnet to Holonet below to get an idea of how it
   works.  This is not an endorsement of this system but it does give
   you a good idea how this type of access to an Internet BBS works.

   2.16 World Wide Webb

      The WWW project merges the techniques of information retrieval and
      hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system.

      The project is based on the philosophy that academic information
      should be freely available to anyone. Its aim is to permit
      information sharing within internationally dispersed teams and
      dissemination of information by support groups.  Originally aimed
      at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas
      and attracted much interest in user support, resource discovery,
      and collaborative work areas.

      Reader View

      The WWW world consists of documents and links.  Indexes are
      special documents which, rather than being read, can be searched.
      The result of such a search is another ("virtual") document
      containing links to the documents found.  A simple protocol
      ("HTTP") is used to allow a browser program to request a keyword
      search by a remote information server.

      The web contains documents in many formats. Those hypertext
      documents (real or virtual) contain links to other documents or
      places within documents.  All documents, whether real, virtual or
      indexes, look similar to the reader and are contained within the
      same addressing scheme.

      To follow a link, you either click with a mouse or type in a
      number. To search an index, give keywords or other search
      criteria. These are the only operations necessary to access the
      entire world of data.

      You can try the simple line mode browser by Telnetting to
      info.cern.ch (no user or password) From UK JANET, use the gateway.
      You also can find out more about WWW in this way.  This is the
      least sophisticated browser; remember that the window-oriented
      ones are much smarter.

      It is much more efficient to install a browser on your own
      machine. The line mode browser is currently available in source
      form by anonymous FTP from node: info.cern.ch [currently
      128.141.201.74] as:

                     /pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z.

      (v.vv is the version number - take the latest.)

   searching through all this information to find what you want.  One of
   the best search methods is Archie, described below.

   Several sites contain large repositories of files and other sites
   that are the source for specific programs such as Kermit, the public
   domain file transfer program.

   4.05 archie

      One of the best ways of searching for a program available via
      anonymous FTP is with archie (Archive Server Listing Service),
      several of these servers scattered throughout the world.  The
      fastest one I have found is the Advanced Network &amp; Services, Inc.
      located in the United States.

      Archie goes to every site that offers anonymous FTP files,
      collects the file structure from that site, and places it in a
      database it can search.

      A real-life example.  I was reading an article about Windows in
      the July 1992 issue of PC World, and it mentioned a shareware
      program called ZiPaper on page 212.  The name of the program is
      zipapr.zip.  I can use Archie to locate this program.

      Source:

      telnet archie.ans.net

      login as archie

      At the archie prompt type

      prog zipapr.zip

      The response is

      Host wuarchive.wustl.edu  (128.252.135.2)
      Last updated 17:22 13 July 1992

         Location:  /mirrors3/archive.umich.edu/msdos/mswindows/desktop
          FILE      rw-rw-r--   41984  Jan 30 1991  zipapr.zip

      This tells you the file is available via anonymous FTP to
      wuarchive.wustl.edu in the directory
      mirrors3/archive.umich.edu/msdos/mswindows/desktop and the file is
      zipapr.zip.

   4.1  Washington University (anonymous FTP)

      Washington University represents perhaps one of the most popular
      sites for software on the network.  The Mirrors directory contains
      a copy of all of the wsmr-simtel20.army.mil files. Wsmr-simtel20-
      army.mil is the originator and keeper of major amounts of public
      domain software.  Their site, however, is often overloaded and
      difficult to connect to.

      You will find enough software in the Mirrors directory to keep you
      busy for the rest of your life.  The MS-DOS and Macintosh
      subdirectories contain files for those specific machines.

      Anonymous FTP to wuarchive.wustl.edu
      cd mirrors

      cd msdos

      For income tax time cd taxes
      For unzipping files cd zip, type binary, and get pkz110eu.exe
      For education software cd education
      For graphics files cd giff, tiff or graphics

      cd macintosh

      For the Macintosh there are directories for applications, inits,
      sounds, reviews, and many more.

   4.2  KERMIT (anonymous FTP)

      Kermit is a public domain file transfer protocol available for
      just about all microcomputers, minicomputers, andmainframes.  It
      is very popular and has been has been used at computer facilities
      everywhere.

      Anonymous FTP to watsun.cc.columbia.edu

      cd kermit
      get read.me

      For executable versions of kermit:

      cd bin

      get READ.ME file and read for specifics of what file to get.

      For the IBM PC, I get msvibm.exe after typing binary to activate
      the binary transfer mode.

   The information in this section is intended primarily for those  who
   are providing access methods from their own computing environments.
   Although standards have been proposed, there are no "packages" that
   give you access to all of the information presented here.  What The
   Ohio State University and several other universities have done is
   provide a menu to the user that accesses these services and databases
   behind the scenes.  In fact, I  had to refer to the shell scripts to
   look up the network addresses of these machines, because I rely on
   the menu for access as well.

   As the name implies, information systems provide access to
   information the user knowing exactly how to get to it.  In this way,
   the network is invisible to end users.  All they need to know is what
   they want, not the command structure needed to actually get the
   information.

   At present, the menu system seems to be the easiest way in In the
   background is a knowbot, a program that knows how to go out and
   locate services on the network using a keyword search.

   You can connect to the following sites for a demonstration of their
   capabilities.

   Many CWIS systems are converting to Gopher (see <a href="#section-8.96">section 8.96</a>).

   WHOIS is a program available on many workstation/mini/mainframe
   computers that can connect to another computer. By supplying a
   persons name, it will respond with information it has on the person.
   A similar program called finger does the same type of thing, except
   it only supplies information on individuals with an account on that
   specific computer.  A WHOIS database generally is contains
   information on most of the individuals at a university, not just on
   the machine you connect to.

   In a larger sense WHOIS is a technique for finding a person's e-mail
   address.  There is no master list of e-mail addresses on the network.
   Standards have been established for supplying e-mail addresses, but
   it will take some time for it to be globally implemented.  In the
   meantime, the easiest way to find out is to call and ask!

   I can just hear the gasps of horror, using the phone for anything but
   talking to your mom, sacrilege.  There are, of course, many ways of
   finding a person's e-mail address.  But what you don't know is if the
   person even reads his/her e-mail, and in the case of multiple e-mail
   addresses, which one is correct.  A simple phone call the first time
   will answer those unknowns quickly.

   The following documents and resources will assist in finding a
   person's e-mail address.

   9.03 College E-mail Address

      Mark Kantrowitz (mkant@cs.cmu.edu) of Caregie-Mellon University
      has compiled an extensive list of techniques for locating e-mail

      alphabetic listing of universities and searching techniques unique
      to each.

      get college-email.-#.text.##
         Note: the files are separated into several sections and you
            need to specify the sections you want by replacing the #
            shown above with a number 1, 2, 3 etc.

      You also can send mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with
      no subject and the body of the text message (with no signature)

      send usenet/soc.college/FAQ:_College_Email_Addresses
      _1_2_[Monthly_posting]

      send usenet/soc.college/FAQ:_College_Email_Addresses
      _2_2_[Monthly_posting]

      Note the above commands should be all on one line.

   9.05 Netfind

      Netfind is a program that goes out and queries the network
      in an organized way to find e-mail addresses.

        Telnet bruno.cs.colorado.edu
        Login is netfind

   9.07 Inter-Network Guide

      When mailing from one network to another you need to know what
      address to use to access the gateway.  For instance, if you want
      to send a message from the Internet to someone on CompuServe, you
      address it to 12345.1234@compuserve.com, where the 12345.1234 is
      the person's CompuServe ID in the form 12345,1234.

      The Inter-Network Mail Guide by John Chew provides this
      information.

      I use some terms here that may not be familiar to all.  The
      following is a brief explanation.

   12.1  BITNET:

      A network of mainframes or minicomputers.  BITNET
      connects many universities and colleges.  It provides
      e-mail and file transfer capabilities, but does not have the
      ability to do remote login (Telnet session capability).

   12.2  Internet:

      A very large network that connects just about any types of
      computers.  It supports e-mail, file transfer (FTP), and
      remote login (Telnet).

   12.3  Anonymous FTP:

      The ability to transfer a file from a remote computer connected
      to the Internet without having an account on the remote computer.
      The program that performs the file transfer is normal FTP.  To
      connect to a remote computer offering anonymous FTP, you can use
      the following commands from a computer connected to the Internet.



<span class="grey">Martin                                                         [Page 37]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc1402.html">RFC 1402</a>                 Searching for Treasure             January 1993</span>


      FTP Internet computer name
      When prompted for a userid, type anonymous
      When prompted for a password, type your e-mail address
      To get a listing of files type dir
      To change directory, type cd directory name
      To get a file, type get filename
      To get a binary file, type binary then get filename
      To end session, type quit

      Example:
      FTP pilot.njin.net
      Username:  anonymous
      Password:  yourname@computer.edu
      cd pub/ftp-list
      get ftp.list
      quit

   12.4  Telnet:

      The ability to establish a connection to a remote computer
      connected to the Internet network.  Two types of programs are used
      to do this.  One, usually called Telnet, establishes a VT100-type
      terminal emulation to the remote computer.  The second, TN3270,
      establishes a full-screen IBM 3270-type terminal connection.

   12.5  Listserv:

      A program available on many BITNET connected computers that can
      act as a mail forwarding system and as a file repository.  BITNET
      is another network that links many colleges and universities It
      does not normally link to military or government institutions as
      does the Internet.  To subscribe to a listserv, you usually send
      mail to the machine that has the mailing list with the command to
      subscribe.  As an example, to subscribe to a list for discussion
      of topics pertinent to mechanical engineering, send e-mail to
      listserv@utarlvml with a message containing the one-line command
      to subscribe:

      SUB MECH-1 John Doe  (Where John Doe would be your full name)

   12.6 Usenet/Read News

      Newsgroups are like public bulletin boards that you can post and
      read messages from other individuals world wide.  More than 1500
      groups cover topics ranging from arts and recreation to more
      research oriented topics such as physics, philosohy, microbiology
      and many many others.  Normally you gain access through a computer
      that has lots of disk space and is connected directly to the



<span class="grey">Martin                                                         [Page 38]</span></pre>
<hr align="left" class="noprint" style="width: 96ex;"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><a class="invisible" href="#page-39" id="page-39" name="page-39"> </a>

      Internet.  You can read many of the newgroups from the Cleveland
      Freenet (<a href="#section-8.1">section 8.1</a>) or from commercial providors of Intenet
      access; for example, Holonet (<a href="#section-1.7">section 1.7</a>).

Disclaimer

   The information provided in the previous sections has been put
   together from multiple sources acquired from the network.  Much of it
   came from reading newsgroups and trying things out to see how they
   worked.  The information is as accurate as I have been able to
   determine, as of July 17, 1992.

   I used a DEC5500 system running Ultrix to check most of these
   sources.  Most of the information is oriented toward Internet, since
   it has remote login (Telnet) and file transfer (FTP).
