Abstract

   This document describes a two-rate, three-color marker that has been
   in use for data services including Frame Relay services.  This marker
   can be used for metering per-flow traffic in the emerging IP and L2
   VPN services.  The marker defined here is different from previously
   defined markers in the handling of the in-profile traffic.
   Furthermore, this marker doesn't impose peak-rate shaping
   requirements on customer edge (CE) devices.

   The differentiated service defines a quality-of-service (QoS)
   architecture for the Internet [<a href="rfc2475.html" title='"An Architecture for Differentiated Service"'>RFC2475</a>].  Two integral components of
   this architecture are traffic metering and marking.  This document
   describes a two-rate, three-color metering/marker algorithm that is

   suitable for the differentiated service applications such as IP and
   L2 VPNs.  This algorithm has been in use for data services including
   Frame Relay Service.

   The metering/marker defined here is different from those in [<a href="rfc2697.html" title='"A Single Rate Three Color Marker"'>RFC2697</a>]
   and [<a href="rfc2698.html" title='"A Two Rate Three Color Marker"'>RFC2698</a>].  It is different from [<a href="rfc2697.html" title='"A Single Rate Three Color Marker"'>RFC2697</a>] in that it is a two-
   rate, three-color marker.  In contrast, [<a href="rfc2697.html" title='"A Single Rate Three Color Marker"'>RFC2697</a>] is a single-rate
   marker.  It is different from [<a href="rfc2698.html" title='"A Two Rate Three Color Marker"'>RFC2698</a>] in the way its parameters are
   defined, which allows a better handling of in-profile traffic for
   predominant service scenarios over a wider range of traffic
   parameters.

   Furthermore, the algorithm described here eliminates the need for the
   CE to shape its traffic to a certain peak information rate (PIR), as
   might be the case for the marker defined in [<a href="rfc2698.html" title='"A Two Rate Three Color Marker"'>RFC2698</a>] when the value
   for the peak burst size (PBS) is smaller than that for the committed
   burst size (CBS).

   The marker described here operates for both color-blind and color-
   aware modes, as defined in [<a href="rfc2698.html" title='"A Two Rate Three Color Marker"'>RFC2698</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/2.%20%20Configuration"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" name="section-2">2</a>.  Configuration</span>

   The operation of the marker is described by two rate values.  The
   committed information rate (CIR) and the excess information rate
   (EIR).  CIR and EIR define the token generation rate of a token
   bucket with size that is equal to committed burst size (CBS) and
   excess burst size (EBS), respectively.

   The CBS and EBS are measured in bytes and must configure to be
   greater than the expected maximum length of the incoming PDU.  The
   CIR and EIR are both measured in bits/s.  The CIR and EIR can be set
   independently of each other.  Alternatively, the CIR and EIR can be
   linked together by defining a burst duration parameter, T, where
   T=CBS/CIR=EBS/EIR.

<span class="h2"><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Section/3.%20%20Metering%20and%20Marking"></a><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" name="section-3">3</a>.  Metering and Marking</span>

   The behavior of the meter is defined in terms of its mode and two
   token buckets, C and E, with the rates, CIR and EIR, respectively,
   and maximum sizes CBS and EBS.

   The token buckets C and E are initially (at time 0) full; i.e., the
   token count Tc(0) = CBS and Te(0) = EBS.  Thereafter, the token count
   Tc is incremented by one CIR times per second (up to CBS), and the
   token count Te is incremented by one EIR times per second (up to
   EBS).

<span class="grey"><a href="rfc4115.html">RFC 4115</a>        Efficient Handling of in-Profile Traffic       July 2005</span>


   In the color-aware operation, it is assumed that the algorithm can
   recognize the color of the incoming packet (green, yellow, or red).
   The color-aware operation of the metering is described below.

   When a green packet of size B arrives at time t, then

      o  if Tc(t)- B &gt; 0, the packet is green, and Tc(t) is decremented
         by B; else

      o  if Te(t)- B &gt; 0, the packet is yellow, and Te(t) is decremented
         by B; else

      o  the packet is red.

   When a yellow packet of size B arrives at time t, then

      o  if Te(t)- B &gt; 0, the packet is yellow, and Te(t) is decremented
         by B; else

      o  the packet is red.

   Incoming red packets are not tested against any of the two token
   buckets and remain red.

   In the color-blind operation, the meter assumes that all incoming
   packets are green.  The operation of the meter is similar to that in
   the color-aware operation for green packets.

   The salient feature of the algorithm described above is that traffic
   within the defined CIR is colored green directly, without the need to
   pass additional conformance tests.  This feature is the main
   differentiator of this algorithm from that described in [<a href="rfc2698.html" title='"A Two Rate Three Color Marker"'>RFC2698</a>],
   where traffic is marked green after it passes two conformance tests
   (those for PIR and CIR).  In either color-blind or color-aware mode,
   the need to pass two conformance tests could result in packets being
   dropped at the PIR token bucket even though they are perfectly within
   their CIR (in-profile traffic).  Furthermore, in the color-aware mode
   of operation, the need to pass two conformance tests could make
   yellow traffic starve incoming in-profile green packets.

   The described marker can be used to mark an IP packet stream in a
   service where different, decreasing levels of assurances (either
   absolute or relative) are given to packets that are green, yellow, or
   red.  For example, a service may discard all red packets because they
   exceeded the service rates, forward yellow packets as best effort,
   and forward green packets with low drop probability.  The marker
   could also be used for metering L2 VPN services such as the emerging
   Ethernet transport over IP networks.
